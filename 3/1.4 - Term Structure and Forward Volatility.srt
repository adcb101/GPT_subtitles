1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,270
All right, guys. So in this video, we're kind of going to go and talk about...

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,490
It's going to be a build on from last night's live.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:14,520
We're going to be talking about the term structure a little bit and how volatility

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,900
is actually... and build forward volatility, right? You know,

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,720
a lot of us are starting to sell these, let's say, 90 DTE strangles,

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,810
180 DTE strangles. And I was talking to a portfolio manager last night,

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,390
and he really gave me an idea here.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,330
So I think we should chat about those just because a lot of us are selling these

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,470
Vega positions, okay? Right. And remember, the point of these lives...

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,550
It may change a little bit down the road,

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,450
but the point of these lives is to really immerse yourselves in the world of option

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,210
trading and volatility. And that will mean taking on challenging concepts,

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,330
sort of understanding what's out there, right? Always remember this.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,180
Things that you're...

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,700
It's better to be exposed to these things than not because there's somebody out

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,440
there trading them.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,490
There's somebody out there looking at this and making better decisions off of it.

18
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,430
The more information we can gather,

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,670
the more we can immerse ourselves in this world,

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,630
the better we come out the other side. So as we go through this,

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,690
if some of the concepts are a little tricky, two things I'll say, number one,

22
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,510
make sure to ask questions, right? If you have a question,

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,450
there's a really good chance that someone else does. And even if it's,

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,070
you know, an entry-level question,

25
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,450
that's okay because maybe it leads to a better question from you,

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,330
a more advanced question down the road, right? We have to start somewhere,

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,710
all of us. And the second thing I'll say is,

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,520
don't worry about getting it all this second.

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,860
You keep coming to these sessions, you keep watching the recordings.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,240
And over time,

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,580
you become the person who just is familiar with these things and you start to see

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,940
them, you start to be able to trade them, you know,

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,200
and that's really when things will start to click. Yep,

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,960
and I think it's very relevant right now, the situation just because...

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,160
So one thing we're gonna be talking about is we're gonna be talking about some of

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,840
the term structures that we're in right now. So for example, LIT, ARK, right?

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,440
Versus let's say another term structure, like it's component Tesla, okay?

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,370
Or S&P during good times and during bad times. And really talk about, you know,

39
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:24,290
how volatility should move, you know, as for the longer dated stuff, okay?

40
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,850
And what the term structure can really tell us. All right,

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,350
so there's no questions about that. We're gonna jump right into it. You know,

42
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,890
Sean and I started like to use a, kind of enjoying the whiteboard. You know,

43
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,770
we did pay for the paint job here. So might as well make some use out of it.

44
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,470
Cool, okay. So imagine we're trading something.

45
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:54,010
Imagine the S&P 500 is in a pandemic, okay? It's in a pandemic.

46
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,050
And we're looking at the term structure, okay? So here's our graph, right?

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,290
This can be found in the PA terminal, okay? And over here, we have IV,

48
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,270
implied volatility. And down here, we have days to expiration, okay?

49
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,350
And where this is, let's say, zero DTE. And this is one year, okay?

50
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,010
So these are the one year options. And these are the zero DTE options.

51
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,900
And what we might see during a pandemic is something that looks, well,

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,660
what do you guys think, right? If we're in a pandemic, right?

53
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,920
We're seeing a lot of volatility.

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,120
What might this term structure look like and why, okay?

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,720
So really start to think about that. What might the term structure look like?

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,860
And why might it look like that, okay? Not much backwardation. Perfect, Steve.

57
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,700
Okay, so what Steve says is backwardation,

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,900
meaning that the near dated options are gonna be really high in terms of implied

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,160
vol.

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,140
And the longer dated options are not gonna be as high in terms of implied vol,

61
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:07,280
okay? It might look something like this, okay? Now, why might this be the case?

62
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,260
Why wouldn't the term structure, so let's say this is the 10 days, right?

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:21,480
This is the one year. And this is the, let's say, 20, 30, okay? 60, 90,

64
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,320
et cetera, okay? Why might the term structure not look like this, let's say,

65
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,740
okay? And when I say term structure,

66
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,320
what I'm talking about is the implied volatilities at different expirations,

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,240
right? So for example, right now we have the January expiration, the February,

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,660
the March, the April, the May, the June, okay?

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,700
Why might it look like this during a pandemic,

70
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,200
during a crisis and not like this, where it's flat, where the IV is the same?

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:09,330
Let's say IV here is 60%. Okay? And IV down here is, let's say, 40%.

72
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,630
Why might it look like that? And what is it really telling us?

73
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,940
Kyle, I don't want to ever hear that word again in this chat, okay?

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,420
Okay, people are worried about it right now. Okay, interesting. What else?

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
What do you guys think, right? You know, someone says, hey,

76
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,850
implied volatility is 45, right? Well, implied volatility of 45, well,

77
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,510
does that really tell us a lot, right? What expiration are they talking about,

78
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,050
right? Do we usually see it like this? Do we usually see it like that?

79
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,770
What's going on here?

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,560
Marketing desperate times, so there's higher uncertainty. Okay, yeah.

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,240
What else, guys? What else? Okay, okay, it's diluted, yeah.

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,890
So one reason for this, right, is volatility is mean reverting, okay?

83
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,590
Imagine we're seeing this in implied volatility, okay? Let's say, for example,

84
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,910
or let's say we're looking at realized volatility.

85
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:29,000
And realized volatility is looking like this, okay? Now, up here, okay,

86
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,960
we'd say, well, this is at one of the highs here, right?

87
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,420
And we know volatility is being reverting.

88
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,020
It probably can't stay at 60 for very long. In the long run, right,

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,260
it's going to for sure come back down, right? So we could sell, let's say,

90
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,500
a longer dated option, right, at, let's say, 60 vol, and make a lot of money.

91
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,400
But the real issue is that markets know that as time goes forward, right,

92
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,720
sure volatility clusters in the short term,

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,300
but then eventually it's going to come back down and mean revert, right?

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,980
So the market knows this, okay? The market knows this,

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,940
that there has to be some, there is some mean reverting function, right?

96
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,720
So as we go through time, volatility should come back down to normal.

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,720
We can see this clearly by just looking at the recent crisis in 2020,

98
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,600
and also 2008, 2001, all these crises, right? We get huge vol,

99
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,320
and then eventually in the long run, it comes back down, right?

100
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,040
It's pretty easy. Just like when vol is at nine,

101
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,820
it's pretty obvious that in the future, at some point,

102
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,550
it's going to be above nine, right? So that is a main driving factor, okay?

103
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,350
That volatility, as we go through time, eventually is going to come back down,

104
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,670
okay? So that is why we don't see this,

105
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,480
but we're going to come back to this because we are seeing this in certain areas,

106
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,550
and I want to get everyone's opinion on it, okay?

107
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:14,030
So just a quick note about this mean reverting characteristic of volatility.

108
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,370
This does not apply to stock price, right?

109
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,930
So I spoke to a couple of members recently who had shared that, you know,

110
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,650
I'd asked them like, if today was a 5% up move,

111
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,720
what move are we likely to see tomorrow? And the response was, you know,

112
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,960
a 5% down move because mean reversion. And I said, you're half right.

113
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,080
It's likely to be a 5% move, but we have no idea if it'll be up or down, right?

114
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,340
From just the vol characteristic of mean reversion.

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:51,190
The mean reversion is not the direction, it's the magnitude of the move, right?

116
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,490
So just to be really clear on that, these are vol characteristics,

117
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,690
not directional characteristics of the asset.

118
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,730
And so we're going to come back to this.

119
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,310
We're going to come back to this because it's going to be very interesting when

120
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,330
we start breaking this down a little bit.

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,370
We are now going to look at it when volatility is low, okay?

122
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,940
So this is when volatility is high. This is when volatility is up here, okay?

123
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,520
And you know what, just to show you guys, why don't we look at a stock?

124
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,580
Why don't we look at,

125
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,930
can we get the PA terminal up here?

126
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,870
Why don't we look at the actual term structure during the pandemic?

127
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:41,910
Okay,

128
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,220
so we go to volatility analyzer and we look at our term structure.

129
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,740
We'll go to S&P 500 and we'll go back to, what was it?

130
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,180
We'll go back to March of 2020, okay? March 20,

131
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,340
okay? So here is the S&P 500 term structure, right?

132
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,060
You can see that it's inverted, okay? It's called backwardation, right?

133
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
It's very high,

134
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,800
very close to expiration and it's much lower as we go out through time, right?

135
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,720
It goes from 80 all the way down to 33 for the one-year options, okay?

136
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,880
Do you guys see that? Let me just make sure. Let me check the chat.

137
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,620
So Eric's saying, so if the vol is at the bottom,

138
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,460
the market is for sure going to overprice vol due to no way to accurately predict

139
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,060
it. So vol is at the bottom. So low vol, I guess. Okay,

140
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,840
so we're gonna get to that in a second, okay?

141
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,310
We're gonna get to that in one second. Okay,

142
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,930
so we saw how the volatility was during that period, right?

143
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,940
It looked like this, okay? Because volatility mean reverts, okay?

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,810
So let us...

145
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,680
Okay, let's say now, okay? We're looking at the volatility here.

146
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,600
It looks something like this. And right now, VIX is at eight and a half,

147
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,960
the lowest ever. The lowest ever, eight and a half, okay?

148
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,170
Mark's asking just what asset were we referring to earlier? Oh, S&P, S&P 500.

149
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:56,870
S&P 500. SPY, to be specific. So let's say VIX is at 8.5. We're right here,

150
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,170
okay?

151
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,050
So the near-dated option, right? Is gonna be very close to the realized vol,

152
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,790
right? The implied and realized are gonna be very close to each other, okay?

153
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,690
So that's gonna be, let's say, somewhere right here, the near-dated option,

154
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,490
okay? What is the far-dated option gonna look like? Who knows?

155
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,730
Who knows what the farther-dated option is gonna look like?

156
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,350
What is the implied volatility gonna be?

157
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,950
High. How high? How high are we thinking? How high are we thinking, Eric?

158
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:35,270
Let's say the bottom here is 8.5, okay? And the max here is 80.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,660
And the recent mean is, let's say, 15. Okay, that's the mean, let's say.

160
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,760
The recent mean is 15. How high do you think the one-year is gonna be, Eric?

161
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,330
Near 50.

162
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,320
Stephen's saying 13. Eric, how come you're saying 50?

163
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,540
Mark's saying it depends on the macro environment. 100%. So let's say, okay,

164
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,680
let's give a little more context here. It's 2017, okay? It's 2017.

165
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,960
There's no elections coming up in the near term.

166
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,560
Everything seems to be pretty good, okay? And we've been realizing, let's say,

167
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,850
7 vol, okay? And right now, VIX is at 8.5.

168
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,960
What do we think it's gonna be one year from now? Stephen's saying 13.

169
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,200
Ari is saying 20. I like it. I like it, okay? It's gonna be somewhere like,

170
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,740
you know, volatility mean reverts, right?

171
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,720
So if we look at volatility in the long run,

172
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,240
it should be somewhere near the mean. So it's, you know, as Mark said,

173
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,500
it all depends on the global environment. But for now,

174
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,520
we're just gonna use the mean, okay? So it's gonna look like this,

175
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,190
something like 15, okay? So it's gonna look like this,

176
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,810
okay? And then this implied volatility is gonna be here.

177
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,510
This implied volatility is gonna be here.

178
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,770
And that implied volatility is gonna be there. And this is called contango.

179
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,830
Okay, and so what is this story telling us? Well,

180
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,000
it's telling us that the market thinks in the future, right,

181
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,580
volatility is gonna go up, okay? In the future, volatility is gonna go up.

182
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Because if we look at it, we're down here, right?

183
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,520
And if we know volatility is mean reverting, it should eventually rise, right?

184
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,370
Now, that's not always the case, right? A lot of the times,

185
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,060
volatility clusters for a long period of time, right?

186
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,220
It clusters for a very long period of time. So we might have, for example,

187
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:49,940
2017, where there's a full year where vol stays at 7.

188
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,860
And these that you could sell, for example, at 15,

189
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:05,990
eventually roll down to 7 vol, okay? So that's called contango.

190
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,750
The other one we showed was backwardation.

191
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,040
Okay, so now that we know this,

192
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,640
we're gonna dive a little bit deeper and to see,

193
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,060
we're gonna talk a little bit some trick questions, okay?

194
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,620
Some trick questions to really get you guys thinking,

195
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,660
really get the brain flowing. So is everyone okay with this?

196
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,230
Chart is not to scale. Is everyone okay? Because you have 60 on. Oh, Eric. Oh,

197
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,030
yeah, sorry, Eric. Yeah, let's imagine it's 15, okay? It looks like that.

198
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,550
Anyone have any questions about this?

199
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,190
And here, let me just show you what it looks like, okay?

200
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,320
So why don't we go to today? I think vols are low today.

201
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,240
Only got two years pumped in here. So actually, let's go back to,

202
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,630
let's go back here. Okay, so you see that, guys?

203
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,390
See the shape of that term structure there, okay? This is the S&P 500 on 2019,

204
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,270
November, okay? In the future, you know, the market thinks vol is gonna rise,

205
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,030
all right?

206
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,470
So these options out here are gonna be sold or bought at a higher implied volatility,

207
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,510
okay? Now, that's not necessarily bad, right? Because, you know,

208
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,760
volatility does mean revert. But it's something we have to be aware of, okay?

209
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,980
And every single day, right? Think about like this, guys.

210
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,240
Imagine if nothing changed, right? Imagine this.

211
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,140
It's not gonna happen this time. Okay, imagine this. Imagine nothing happened,

212
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,800
okay? Well, this, imagine we sold, imagine we bought this, okay?

213
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,250
Or let's say we bought this one right here, three months out. Well,

214
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:09,070
nothing happens in one month, right? This is not gonna go here, okay?

215
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,850
It's actually gonna roll down here.

216
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,690
It's probably a bad idea overlapping colors, eh? No? Why?

217
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,870
I feel like it changes the color on this one. I think it's fine. Okay,

218
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,810
this is gonna roll down here.

219
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,760
So we're actually gonna lose money from the roll down, okay?

220
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,140
And there's actually a strategy out there where people sell the front months during

221
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,060
contango, okay? Because then every day it rolls down.

222
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,090
And they buy when it's in backwardation because every time it rolls up, okay?

223
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,610
So that's a strategy that some people use.

224
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,810
Yeah, so that is, that's that. Now, let's get, so everyone's okay with this?

225
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,530
Can someone give me a yeah? We're okay with this?

226
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,900
Yeah, yeah, really good point, Mark. So people, Mark's saying, you know,

227
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,900
selling this, right?

228
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Just going up and blatantly selling this can be quite dangerous, right?

229
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,280
So what people usually do is they do a calendar spread where they'll sell this and

230
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,670
buy, let's say, something back here, okay? So that if there was an explosion,

231
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,130
right? First off, it's not margin efficient. And secondly,

232
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,470
if there was an explosion, well, even though,

233
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,610
remember we talked one of our lives how the term structure moves,

234
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,780
even if there's a blowout, right? We're going to be hedged with the back month,

235
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,920
okay? So that's what Mark is talking about there. Great, great,

236
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:54,920
okay. So now let's talk about what this term structure implies.

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,940
So we're going to go back to,

238
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,540
we're going to go back and visit in backwardation just because some of the stocks

239
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,680
we're trading right now might or might not have backwardation,

240
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,500
but I think it's something we should really talk about here, okay?

241
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,950
So here is a company or a stock that's in backwardation, okay?

242
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:27,570
Let's say, guys, this 30-day option, okay, is, let's say, 60 IVOL, okay?

243
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,760
And this option, which is, let's say, 60 days out, so this is a 30-day, okay?

244
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:43,530
This is a 60-day, is 40 IVOL, okay? It's 40 IVOL. So far, so good.

245
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,870
Everyone understands this. We have two options here. One that's 30 days out,

246
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,860
one that's 60 days out, okay? So what is this option?

247
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,680
What is the volatility that this option is going to see over the next 30 days?

248
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
It's implying it's going to see over the next 30 days,

249
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,030
okay?

250
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,010
What is the volatility that this option thinks it's going to see over the next 30

251
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,350
days?

252
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,190
Excellent, excellent, Steve.

253
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,910
No, 60. This one is going to see 60 IV, okay? This option right here,

254
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,090
expiring in 30 days, is going to see 60 IV.

255
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,580
That's what it's thinking it's going to see, okay? Now,

256
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,740
what is going to happen to this option though? Okay, so we're trading,

257
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,160
let's say, the longer-dated stock, okay? We're trading the 60 DTE option here,

258
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,700
okay? We're selling the 60 DTE. We're selling the 90 DTE, okay?

259
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,110
What is this telling us here, right? This is very important, very crucial,

260
00:20:51,430 --> 00:21:02,410
okay? Because originally, right, we might think that, okay, in 30 days, right,

261
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,420
this might still be, if nothing changes, okay?

262
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,590
I'm going to go by this super slow. In 30 days, and this is a misconception,

263
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,230
just to make it clear. In 30 days, if nothing happens,

264
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,550
this is still going to be 40 IV. Okay? In 30 days, if nothing happens,

265
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,110
it's going to be still 40 IV. What's the issue with this?

266
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,810
What is the issue with that thinking?

267
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,020
Thank you, Steven. Steven is saying, that's incorrect. This will fall, okay?

268
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,810
And what did, how can we really see this? How can we paint the picture here?

269
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,770
Okay, so let's go back to our graph that we did yesterday.

270
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,120
Let's go back to the graph we did yesterday. And at the end, guys, you know,

271
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,400
stay till the end of this because it's going to all tie back into a couple positions

272
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,960
that we have right now. And how, you know, it's acting very strange.

273
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,980
Okay, let's go back to our thing here. Here, so here is today.

274
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,720
Here is 60 days from now. And here is 30 days.

275
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:33,100
We know that the IV from today to 30 days is going to be 60. Okay,

276
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,040
we're going to call it 60.

277
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:36,960
Okay?

278
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:49,980
And we know that from 60 to today is going to be 40, right?

279
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,160
This option here is going to see 40 IV. So we're going to say 40 here.

280
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,480
Okay, it's going to be 40. But here's the thing, or sorry guys,

281
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,590
the whole life of this option is going to be 40, okay?

282
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,430
The whole thing is going to be 40.

283
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:17,650
From 60 or from today to 60 days is going to be 40 implied volatility. Now,

284
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:25,520
here's the thing. We are seeing 60 vol here. We're seeing 60 vol here.

285
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,300
So once this is gone, remember volatility is the average, right?

286
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:38,520
It's going to be the average. So once the 60 vol is gone, this should drop,

287
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,880
okay? Once this option is going to realize 60 implied volatility,

288
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,340
and then it might realize 20 implied volatility,

289
00:23:51,530 --> 00:24:03,860
giving an average of 40, okay? And this number here, this 20 number here,

290
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,560
is going to be called something.

291
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,300
It's going to be called the forward volatility, okay?

292
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,600
And that's the volatility.

293
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,540
So we have this as the life of this option right here.

294
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,920
We have this as the life of the option here.

295
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,220
But what about the life of the option between here, right?

296
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,360
Between 30 and 60 days? Well,

297
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,440
that's called the forward volatility between the 30 and the 60.

298
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,760
So what we should see once this 30 days are over is that this option that's trading

299
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,420
at 40 vol is actually going to drop to 20 vol,

300
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,220
okay? And so on and so forth of these. Does that make sense? If not,

301
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,080
we're going to go back.

302
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,580
We're going to make sure that everyone understands this concept because we're going

303
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,280
to show you afterwards something that is very funky in the market right now,

304
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,020
okay? So everyone gets it. Are you sure? Is everyone sure?

305
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Please don't feel free to speak up and ask, right?

306
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,040
There's nothing wrong with asking, right? These are very difficult concepts,

307
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:16,700
right?

308
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,760
I'm sure you can't turn to your friend or your family and talk about these concepts,

309
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,380
right? They're very difficult concepts. So if you have any questions,

310
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,370
please ask. Okay, I'll run through one more time.

311
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,770
Okay, I'll run through one more time.

312
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,460
Okay.

313
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,900
Okay, you know what? I'm going to draw. I got a good way to draw.

314
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,440
I got a good way to draw.

315
00:25:52,970 --> 00:26:04,150
You have two options, okay? Option one is going to see 30 days or option one.

316
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,480
Let's start over. Let's make this nice and clear. Option one and option two,

317
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,620
okay?

318
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:26,030
Option one is going to see 30 days. Option two is going to see 60 days. Now,

319
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,620
we know option one is 60 implied volatility.

320
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,240
And we know option two is 40 implied volatility.

321
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,010
We also know that option two is going to see what option one sees.

322
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,650
They're both going to see 30 days.

323
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:57,810
So option two is going to see 60 IV for these 30 days, okay?

324
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:03,730
So this is going to be 60 IV for this option as well, okay? Now,

325
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,150
what's going to happen the next 30 days after this expires,

326
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:17,510
right? And this number right here is what we call the forward volatility, okay?

327
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,350
Between these two options.

328
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,370
And because volatility... So there's actually a formula for it.

329
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,100
And maybe it's good that we calculate it right now.

330
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,280
So forward vol is going to be equal to square root. Doing some code.

331
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,770
Doing code mode. Square root, okay?

332
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:53,760
Volatility one squared times days to expiration of number one plus volatility squared

333
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:07,840
of number two times DTE number two, okay? Divided by, okay,

334
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,450
DTE one minus DTE two.

335
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,550
Okay, so this is the actual formula for calculating the forward volatility,

336
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,740
okay? If we plug in these numbers here,

337
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,100
we're going to be able to get this number, okay? But for simplicity,

338
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,330
it's going to be very close to the average of these, okay? So this right here,

339
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:45,560
Jared, is going to be 20 IV. So this option here is 40, right?

340
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,760
This option that's going to see 60 days is going to be compiled of two areas.

341
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,820
One area, 60 IV, the first 30 days. And then the next 30 days of 20 IV.

342
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,050
Does that make sense?

343
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,730
Okay, great. Great. Okay. Excellent, guys. Excellent. We're getting there.

344
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,550
We're getting there. We're getting there, okay? Stay till the end.

345
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,110
We're going to have... We're going to show some of these crazy, crazy markets.

346
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,510
What retailers are... What retail traders are doing to the market, okay?

347
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,770
Stay to the end. It's going to be very important.

348
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,360
You guys can use your analysis right away starting tomorrow. Because I know,

349
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,500
Tico, you're about to ask that question. How can I make money? Okay.

350
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,700
How are we doing for time here? 830. Okay. IV.

351
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,320
And...

352
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:55,410
Okay, yeah. So let's drop it. Let's draw it again. Super quick. This is 60,

353
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:01,440
right? This is 40. And this is like, let's say, 20, okay? Once,

354
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,430
when we're looking at this, what we can say here is that once this...

355
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,150
There's something here. Something... There's something happening right here,

356
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:16,570
okay? Something big. Now, once this is over, this should drop, right?

357
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:22,470
This should drop once this is over. And so we can actually assume, okay?

358
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,750
We can assume when we see something like that, this,

359
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,570
that if volatility does drop, right? If realized volatility does drop. If,

360
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:37,210
you know, if nothing really happens over the next 30 days, that these,

361
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,530
if we sell these,

362
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,870
we're going to make a ton of money because the vol is going to drop down 20 points.

363
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,320
It's going to drop down 20 points. So we can assume, right? That, okay,

364
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,420
as soon as whatever the market's thinking is going to end, right?

365
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,800
As soon as volatility drops or if nothing really happens,

366
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,540
we're going to make a ton of money. We're gonna make a ton of money on vega,

367
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,920
right? Now, obviously, if the market blows out, we're short vol here.

368
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,900
It might not work like that, right? We might end up losing money.

369
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,780
But we know that once volatility is gone or slows down,

370
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,510
that this is going to lose a ton of money, right? After these 30 days expire,

371
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,730
this is going to go from 40 to 20,

372
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,130
okay? Now,

373
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,170
let's take a look at something very interesting in real life happening right now.

374
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,530
And I'm going to show you guys on the term. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,610
I'm going to show you guys on the terminal here,

376
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,320
okay? Let me show you something very interesting right now.

377
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,040
Are you sharing screen? Yeah, I'm going to, and here we go.

378
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,870
Bless you. Okay.

379
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,690
Let's check this out, guys.

380
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,480
So look where we are, okay? We are at the top of the range.

381
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,620
So here's the current, right? Let's get rid of some of this stuff here.

382
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,840
Let's get rid of the max.

383
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,400
So we are at the top of the range in implied volatility.

384
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,880
You can see that right here, right?

385
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:29,300
But look at this. The term structure is flat. The term structure is flat.

386
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,580
And if we had 120 DTE, it's actually flat across the whole surface. Actually,

387
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,700
we can see it right here. Let's go to term structure, okay? Let's type in lit.

388
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,840
We're seeing this on arc, okay? Okay, this is the 252,

389
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,280
which we don't have the data for it. But you can see here,

390
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,980
all the way up to the 120 DTE, the term structure is flat.

391
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,400
We get a 1% kick down going out in time, out 120 days, right? Let's do an arc.

392
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,410
So what is happening here? Oh, arcs, oh, well, it's a little bumpy, right?

393
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:11,520
But even then, look, we're going from 55 to 54, 120 days out, right?

394
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,830
So this is pretty damn flat, right? And we can see that here.

395
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,280
If we go to volatility insights, we type in arc, okay?

396
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
We type in arc and we're pretty flat, right?

397
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,900
You can see that when we're at the max, at the peak,

398
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,040
we get into some backwardation, right?

399
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,240
Does anyone have a stock that has earnings coming up soon that we can look at right

400
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,420
now? Just to show you guys. Stock that has earnings coming up.

401
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,830
Does anyone have a big, it has to have a big implied move,

402
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,690
big implied move priced in. Who's got it?

403
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,480
Hachi on live? Netflix. Thanks, Mark.

404
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,250
Okay, so do you see that, guys? Do you see it?

405
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:09,090
So let me just remove third quantile here and max. Okay, so you can see this,

406
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,470
right? The market's saying, okay, there's some volatility here, right?

407
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,270
The event. But once this event is gone, right?

408
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,550
Then we should go back to normal, right? This is going to certainly drop,

409
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,770
right? And we see that, right? The reason why this is 53 is because it has,

410
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,290
it's going to see 62 and then it's going to see something maybe like 40, right?

411
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:34,090
So that's going to drop after the event. Now, but look, let's go back to lit.

412
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,040
Okay, let's go back to lit.

413
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,890
Here we are seeing flat. It's completely flat.

414
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:49,220
So what is the market telling us here? The market is telling us that vol,

415
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,680
that this is going to be relatively the new mean, right? Now, not perfectly.

416
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,380
There's other things going on that are in this. But, you know,

417
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,560
in a general sense,

418
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,920
the market is telling us that this is going to be the new mean. Vols at 57.

419
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,820
Okay, vols at 57. That's going to be the new mean. This is happening for arc.

420
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,260
This is happening for lit. Okay, instead of seeing something like this, right?

421
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,680
Remember, right now we are seeing insane volatility.

422
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,780
Look at volatility getting pumped up here. Okay,

423
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,140
look at vol getting pumped up here. Actually, let's go back. Let's go to arc,

424
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,640
actually. I'm actually curious. So this will do this real time.

425
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,070
Let's take a look here. We're going to do this in real time.

426
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:37,420
Let's see what arc was when we started getting this big vol here,

427
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,500
right around September 15. Let's take a look.

428
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,640
Arc.

429
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,930
Oh, whoops.

430
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,880
Let's go back to September 15. Okay, let's see what it looked like there. Oh,

431
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,180
sorry, guys. I'm on skew analysis with trim structure here.

432
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,980
Oh, it's kind of flat too, eh?

433
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,590
Well, you know what it is? It's the zero mark. That's messing it up.

434
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,270
But you can see we don't even have that much. You know,

435
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,730
we don't have too much backwardation there,

436
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:43,050
but it does drop off to 47 at the end, right? So let's go back to our tab here.

437
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:49,210
So right now we're flat, right? We're almost completely flat here.

438
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,810
So the market's telling us that this volatility that we're seeing is going to be

439
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,440
here to stay. Now, what do we think about that, right? Realize vol,

440
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,060
if we look at the graph on the top right here,

441
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,980
we're starting to approach the highs, right?

442
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,400
We see volatility is mean reverting. If I had a longer graph,

443
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
we could see that it's mean reverting.

444
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,240
But we're seeing that it's mean reverting.

445
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,920
And right now we're reaching the highs, not even. And vol is looking like this.

446
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,160
So what the market's saying is,

447
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,380
there's no mean reverting feature on this, right? This is the mean.

448
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,880
If the market thought it was going to be mean reverting,

449
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,180
we'd see it come down like this. But we're seeing it flat.

450
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,080
So the market's telling us, this is probably the long-term mean right here,

451
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,240
right? The vol we're seeing right now is going to be the long-term mean.

452
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,080
And so the way that I think about it is, I think this is way too bid.

453
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:55,640
I think these are way too bid out here, right? In my opinion, 5%, 5% days,

454
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,210
that is the long-term mean. I can't see it.

455
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,910
I can't see how this should be priced to the same vol of this, right?

456
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,330
If anything, we can maybe do a calendar spread where we take advantage.

457
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,990
We take advantage of the realized vol that's happening right now, right?

458
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:17,650
That's clustering. And we sell some of this stuff, right? We do a, you know,

459
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,990
it's not the greatest in terms of margin, right?

460
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,650
Especially for a T-REC account.

461
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,170
But what we can do here is take advantage of that.

462
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:31,180
By offsetting it by some quite expensive theta back here, okay?

463
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:39,810
Like we sell these and buy this. Now, we decided just to sell these, okay?

464
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:45,410
And that is because we think this is not the long-term mean. And instead,

465
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,570
this should be way down here at 40, maybe 35.

466
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,980
Okay, now we were right, we were wrong, sorry, on lit. But even now,

467
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,040
we're getting back into it and starting to sell some.

468
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,960
So what do you guys think about that? Let's see.

469
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,540
So Mark, I mean, Eric,

470
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,400
I wouldn't say that they don't know what to do with them.

471
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,440
They're just pricing it at that, right? Like Stephen said, had an idea.

472
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,700
The market's saying this is the new vol regime. And, you know,

473
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
this is going to be the mean going forward, right?

474
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,960
ARK moving 5% a day is going to be the new normal.

475
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,960
So let's see what else. We've got a couple of statements here. Yep,

476
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,200
so Stephen's saying the market's entering a new vol regime.

477
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,900
That's what they're thinking.

478
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,860
I wonder what it was like in the tech bubble. They don't have,

479
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,820
ARK I don't think was around during the tech bubble.

480
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
I think it started in 2015. I was looking at some of the data for 2018.

481
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,420
Parth's saying, when did the market solidify this?

482
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,440
This was my thesis for VIX long. Okay,

483
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,600
so I'm not too sure what you mean by solidify this.

484
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,500
This is just what the market's expecting right now, right? Tomorrow,

485
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,480
for example, well,

486
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,900
at least what we think is going to happen is eventually the market is going to realize,

487
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,300
as soon as realize vol starts to be like, let's say 2% a day, 1.5% a day.

488
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,900
As soon as that happens again, the market's going to realize, wait a minute,

489
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:31,100
this isn't the mean. The mean is down here, right?

490
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,470
And so this is going to drop, right? That's what we're estimating, right?

491
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,490
As soon as, so you saw today, for example,

492
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:44,380
vol was 1.5% or the move was 1.5% today. And if that continues to happen,

493
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,160
or it's 2%, if that continues to happen,

494
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,720
we're going to see this drop down substantially.

495
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,080
So I don't know what you mean specifically by,

496
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,200
is that the market solidify this?

497
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,860
And Mark's saying, another way to look at it is even if you're wrong,

498
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,780
the risk should be low as it would be hard to have sustained average vol much higher

499
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,560
than this, right?

500
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:16,200
Like imagine sustained volatility of an ETF with stocks like Roku, Salesforce,

501
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:26,060
Tesla, CRSP as the top holders, right? Imagine a sustained vol, let's say 60%,

502
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,640
right? And that's also including the correlation,

503
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,360
like this ETF had zero correlation, was carrying zero realized correlation,

504
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,380
right? So imagine something that's sustained at 60 or 65, right?

505
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,880
It'd be extraordinary. And so that's what Mark's saying.

506
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,920
So it could be a good risk reward trade here.

507
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,660
I think you have Stockholm syndrome. Could you explain to me? I've never,

508
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,560
I've never, do you know what Stockholm syndrome is?

509
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,650
You fall in love with the person who like kidnapped you. Yeah.

510
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,950
So they say like,

511
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,590
the stock burned you so bad that you now like are obsessed with it. Oh, well,

512
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,770
Mark did us really well. Lit did us pretty well. We cut lit.

513
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,610
So it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It could have been disastrous.

514
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:15,610
So blessing saying,

515
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,870
would you not normally sell front month on a calendar spread? Okay.

516
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:25,980
So I wouldn't sell it in this situation, right?

517
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,740
The reason why I wouldn't sell it in this situation is that realized vol is actually

518
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,960
quite high, right? Realized vol is actually really, really high.

519
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,940
So this actually might be justified, right? This actually might be justified,

520
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,920
but we think that the term structure should look like this,

521
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,980
where sure there's a lot of vol now, but in the future,

522
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,210
we should get back to normal, right? So I don't want to be selling really here.

523
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,290
I want to be selling over here in a calendar spread. Sure,

524
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:00,330
you could do it like this, but usually you don't want to be,

525
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,330
you don't want to be by a calendar spread when it's in, when it's in contango,

526
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,730
when it's in backwardation like this,

527
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,790
you want to be doing it when it's in contango. Okay.

528
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,390
Where the front month is dropping, right? The front month is dropping quick,

529
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,250
right? It's, the realized vol is a lot lower than implied.

530
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,830
And so selling that front month is going to do well. In the back month,

531
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,850
it's going to stay a bit. Okay. So this is, so Aria is saying,

532
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,990
but if retail are the ones moving this market here and they just keep buying,

533
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:33,050
won't it stay a bit? Yeah. And Aria, it's been happening for quite a while,

534
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,470
man. I actually couldn't believe when I saw lit go to,

535
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:42,290
when I saw lit go to 60 vol in the back, it blew my mind. But that is true,

536
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:47,480
right? And eventually though, eventually like retail can't,

537
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,600
like it's not infinite money, right? Eventually they can,

538
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,160
so the market can remain rational,

539
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,860
irrational longer than you can remain solvent, right?

540
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,680
And so surely can keep buying, but eventually the buying has to stop, right?

541
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,900
So we need to position ourselves where one, we hope it, you know,

542
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,270
we hope it doesn't last, let's say six months, right? So, but two,

543
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,830
we need to be able to withstand some heat, right?

544
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,310
We need to be able to withstand, let's say vol picking up another five,

545
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,030
10 points. Okay.

546
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,570
So how long would you hold a position like this for like on average,

547
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,450
do you think? Obviously it's until the vol drops or when you're wrong is when?

548
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,510
When I'm wrong is when let's say realized vol continues to shoot up like unbelievable

549
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,990
amounts, right? Because then if we see,

550
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:37,170
let's say realized volatility moving 10% a day again, right?

551
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,850
Then we can be in serious trouble here, right? Because the reason I ask is,

552
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,530
and I was kind of thinking about this too, right? If you,

553
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,730
if you think you could be holding this for three weeks, how, Ko was asking,

554
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,380
how would you, you know, hedge, what do you wanna call it?

555
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,400
You said things are moving. How would you protect from like a price increase,

556
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,320
right? So like, you know, if equities on average trend upwards, right?

557
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,640
This is a ETF, it should on average move upwards.

558
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,090
Would you maybe structure your strangle a little biased long Delta or would you

559
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,890
just hedge your Deltas? Yeah, so Ko, it really depends on your view, right?

560
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,670
If you want long Delta, then I'm not into the strangle, right? If you want,

561
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:21,270
so the strangle can give you short vol, short Vega and long Delta.

562
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,500
You just shift the body or the middle up. Yeah,

563
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,100
so it really depends on your view. And in my case, for example,

564
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,020
I'm probably gonna be hedging.

565
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,880
I'm almost certainly gonna be hedging if we get too much in the move.

566
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,560
And Mark said something really good here. So I just want you, blessing,

567
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,480
great seeing you. Oh, sorry, that was Bron. Bron, great seeing you, man.

568
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,160
Have a great dinner.

569
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,470
Oh, a blessing saying it's when you feel sorry for someone who's kidnapped you.

570
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,930
Yeah, or like you fall in love with them or something. Aria,

571
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,890
if you can maybe elaborate a little more on that.

572
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,280
Okay, so Ko, that's a really good point.

573
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,280
Ko is saying ARK can go up another 50% in six months. So 50% in six months,

574
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,700
if you break it down, that's quite a bit of vol. But if you're just going like,

575
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,720
let's say one, like half a percent a day every day, well,

576
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,760
that's gonna be easy to hedge.

577
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,460
And then we should earn money as well because the vol wasn't that high.

578
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,140
And vol should drop, right? If it's only realizing half a percent a day.

579
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,780
So Mark had a really good point here, guys.

580
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,440
The thing we should talk about for a second. You know,

581
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,460
this is in response to someone's question, right? Somebody said,

582
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,360
if retail are driving the market, retail keep buying. If they keep buying,

583
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,980
shouldn't this just stay or get higher? Then Mark responded and said,

584
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,620
sustained buying doesn't increase vol if it's not a sharp jump in prices.

585
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,500
Vol will eventually decline in the midst of sustained moderate appreciation.

586
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,760
So here, this is a really good point. This is a really, really...

587
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,520
And I actually just learned this during the crash of 2020.

588
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,120
So this is a really good point here. So check this out, guys.

589
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:11,250
During the crash, okay? We all know that when stocks go down,

590
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,050
fixed usually goes up most of the time. And if stocks go down a lot,

591
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:21,280
VIX goes up. But guess what happened at the very end of the financial crisis,

592
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,600
okay? Of the COVID crisis.

593
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,610
VIX, so S&P was going down, okay? Down, down, down.

594
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:38,210
And VIX was going up every single day. At one point, okay?

595
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:44,120
I think this is on March 20th, this happened. VIX, right before March 20th,

596
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:54,810
VIX was at 80, let's say, okay? And S&P was at 200, okay? The next day,

597
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:04,160
the S&P went down 4%. Huge move down. But guess what happened to VIX?

598
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,620
It also came down, okay? And that's because,

599
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,770
and I'm sure there was a ton of buying here, right?

600
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,090
I'm sure there was a ton of buying here,

601
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:22,950
of puts as the stock continued to move down. If the realized volatility, okay?

602
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:31,510
Remember, VIX at 80, right? Is implying like a 6% move a day, right? Or sorry,

603
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,510
a 5% move a day,

604
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:38,990
okay?

605
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:47,520
So even though we realized only 4%, right? And stocks went down,

606
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,080
VIX dropped as well because it couldn't sustain that.

607
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,010
It could not sustain that level. Even though there was a ton of buying here,

608
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,010
right?

609
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:02,680
We need an enormous amount of money coming into the market to be able to push this

610
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,900
up higher, right?

611
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:12,740
It's a lot easier to move VIX from 10 to 12 than it is 80 to 82.

612
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,520
It's a lot harder, right?

613
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:24,060
And I think I just learned that during this crash of 2020, right?

614
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,020
So we always learn something new,

615
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,580
but I think that was a really fantastic point that Mark mentioned.

616
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,650
Oh, no. Okay, here. Oh, not again, guys. Yeah, not again.

617
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,930
Just explain it quick. Okay, yeah, super quick.

618
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,020
The VIX came down even though the S&P went down.

619
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,060
And that was because the VIX was implying an extraordinary move, right?

620
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,830
At 80 and the market didn't move enough, right?

621
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,650
It's a lot easier to go from VIX from 10 to 12 than it is from VIX from 80 to 82,

622
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,610
okay? Or percentage moves. So what's that? 80, 96.

623
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:11,750
It's actually a linear product. VIX is actually a linear product.

624
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,470
Just because the volatility, the vol of vol increases to the upside,

625
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,900
it looks like it's exponential, but it's actually a linear product, right?

626
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,200
There's actually no convexity there,

627
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,850
okay? So it was a big topic, big live today, guys. All the way till nine, wow.

628
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:37,180
Wow, these lives are getting intense, man. Yeah, the whiteboard.

629
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,600
It's the whiteboard. These are lectures, guys.

630
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:48,980
Oh, yeah, Mark? Hey, Renato. Hey, thanks, Mark. Mark, I think you actually...

631
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,320
Mark, were you here for the Bitcoin one?

632
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,220
I think that was a fun one too to chat about.
