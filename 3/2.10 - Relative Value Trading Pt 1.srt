1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,450
Yeah. Okay, guys. So this week,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,430
we're going to be talking about relative value, right?

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,080
It's such an important topic. And you know,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,540
the new terminal is going to have all the relative value stuff.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,100
We're actually going to be showing you the new terminal as we talk about relative

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,460
value. And you know, as we guys go forward, and as you guys, you know,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,380
start growing your account,

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,400
relative value is almost certainly going to be in your book.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,070
So I think someone wants to say something funny. I see you laughing. Yeah,

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,510
I just keep lowering Pranav's hand.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,730
Yeah, so, you know, this is a really important topic. And not only for this,

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,950
guys, it's going to make you start thinking differently, right?

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,930
When you're thinking relative, you know, you can start to find new ideas. Like,

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,430
so for example, if you're doing earnings trades,

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,670
you're selling ball around earnings. Well,

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,610
what is Citigroup earnings relative to the rest of the bank sector? Right?

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,350
So these are type of things that thinking of relative value terms is very important.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,330
And in fact, sometimes it's actually the most important.

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,090
And we're going to talk about that as we go through. All right,

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,310
let's do we have anything when you close here? Yeah,

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,930
let's just make this a big screen here for the guys. We got to set this up.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,160
Okay.

23
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,290
All right. All right, guys. Here we go. Check this out.

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,700
I think this is Young Jojo. Young Jojo. Yeah, we'll go 1.5.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,040
So it's only gonna be two minutes. Okay, guys. So here we go. What's up, guys?

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,060
Welcome back to the channel. And today I did my first trade,

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,760
my first earnings trade on MSM. And before we get to any earnings trade,

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,000
I thought I'd talk about why you should trade and the only time you should ever

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,900
trade. So there's a big misconception that, you know,

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,040
traders make tons of money and, you know,

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,640
you should quit your job and just trade full time for a living.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,740
But the thing is, it's actually very difficult to trade, right?

33
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,180
Because you're competing against so many other people.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,060
And so the only way you should ever trade, the only way you should ever think,

35
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,340
you know what,

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,620
ever click that mouse to say buy or sell is if you know something that the market

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,180
does not know. So for this example, I'm going to be using FIFA 06, right?

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,220
So I've had this game for 13 years. I played with all my friends,

39
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,780
love this game. Fantastic. Now, if I decide to put this up on eBay, right,

40
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,830
I could put up a value where it actually doesn't where it doesn't actually match

41
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,030
the actual real value. Right. So, for example,

42
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,610
let's say all let's say there's another FIFA 06 on eBay and it's going for twenty

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,730
five dollars. Now,

44
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,590
I know this one would be worth twenty five dollars as well if it was in the same

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,990
condition. But what if there's a little scratch? Right.

46
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,550
Then I could put it up for maybe twenty four dollars.

47
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,450
Get the buy knowing it's only worth fifteen dollars or five dollars.

48
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,430
And that's because I have an advantage of an edge there.

49
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,110
But if everybody was looking at this game, right,

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,650
like let's say I had a thousand analysts looking at this game.

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
They're going to someone to catch on this. And once they catch on it,

52
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,800
they're going to tell everyone else and it's going to affect the price of the value

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,600
of this FIFA 06 game. But when no one knows about it,

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,460
that's me having an advantage. So there's two ways we could trade this.

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,560
We could trade this. Absolutely. Right.

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,880
So whatever this whatever I think this will go for it,

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,500
whatever else someone is willing to pay for it.

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,150
And that's called absolute value. Right.

59
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,150
And then we also can trade it relatively. So for example,

60
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,330
this is going for ten dollars. Well,

61
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,130
then what is winning 11 going for or winning? Yeah. Winning 11 06.

62
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,530
So same year. Very similar. It's like Coca-Cola, Pepsi.

63
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,630
And if I know that winning 11 is worth twenty bucks,

64
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,890
why am I going to sell this for ten bucks? Right. It's worth way more.

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,620
And so that is relative value. And that's the better way to trade.

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,980
So the first thing we should learn about trading is only trade when you have an

67
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,620
edge. And how do you know you have an edge? Right.

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,040
Like that's that's that's the million dollar question.

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,680
How do you know that you have a statistical edge or how do you know that you should

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,200
put on a trade?

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,200
And the answer is, if you don't know, you don't have an edge. It's that simple.

72
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,020
I know that this game has a scratch on it.

73
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,190
I have an edge or I know that the Coca-Cola CEO is going to release this tomorrow.

74
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,130
You guys don't know it, but I know it. And therefore I should make the trade.

75
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,170
Right. Are you guys following me now? So thanks again, guys, for watching.

76
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,950
I'll see you guys in the next videos. I'm trying to get better at these.

77
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,910
So let me know in the comments down below.

78
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,190
What do you guys think where I can improve? And yeah.

79
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,070
See you guys in the next video. Cheers. It's on slow speed.

80
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,250
So let's see what the people in the comments had to say. There we go.

81
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,910
No comments. No comments. No comments. OK. So let's get into the vault up here.

82
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,190
OK. So actually, let's let's stop sharing the screen for a second.

83
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,680
We're going to chat about it. Guys,

84
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,760
make sure you're typing to all panelists and attendees.

85
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,740
Got a ton of people talking here, but you're not seeing what you're saying.

86
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,120
Yeah.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,920
Yeah. I made I made all those all those videos private, guys.

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,080
Way back and way back when.

89
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,300
OK. So let's talk. Let's talk about relative value.

90
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,560
So what what is relative value right in the first place?

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,500
Relative value is basically when you're looking at one asset through the lens of

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,980
looking at all the assets that are similar to it. OK.

93
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,940
So super example of super simple example of relative value.

94
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,800
What is Bitcoin trading at relative to all the other coins relative to Ethereum

95
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,450
or Litecoin or any of those? Right. And that is the relative value lens.

96
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,210
We're not just saying, OK, here is Coca-Cola.

97
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,170
It has this much earnings is trading at this price. It's trading at, you know,

98
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,930
the growth rate is X, Y, Z. Instead, we're saying, well,

99
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,430
Coca-Cola is growing at 5 percent and Pepsi is going at two and a half percent.

100
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,200
Right. Maybe we can make a trade here. And that is relative value. OK.

101
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,800
So I want to ask you guys a question here, OK?

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,780
And this is how we can think about it.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,000
You really like Pepsi. You think Pepsi is a great. Actually,

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,800
let's let's talk about Goldman Sachs. You really like Goldman Sachs.

105
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,320
They're growing at extremely fast rate. And but right now,

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,640
the market is saying, like, this company's dogshit. This company is, you know,

107
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,840
it's probably not a good company and like it's trading at such a low value. OK.

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,370
Extremely low value relative to what you think. What trade would you make?

109
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,270
What kind of trades can we start making here?

110
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,780
We can even give the example of the Apple trade that we're talking about,

111
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,150
the buying Apple stock. I think Apple's going up. Yeah.

112
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,010
We're giving an example. Short of the market. Oh, yeah. Right. Right.

113
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,110
So perhaps perhaps saying buy one, sell the other. I don't know.

114
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,310
I don't know what you're selling. I know what you're buying here. Right.

115
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,110
And then what Sean said as well was with the Apple trade. Right.

116
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,750
Like imagine you had a view that Apple was going to go up. Right.

117
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,650
But your view was actually like Apple is, you know,

118
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,050
going to the reason you bought Apple and not the S&P is you think Apple is going

119
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,150
to do better, obviously. Right.

120
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,550
You think Apple is going to grow 20 percent a year.

121
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,610
So why would you settle for an average of eight? Well, when you buy Apple,

122
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,080
you want to really isolate that outperformance of Apple. Right. You don't.

123
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,680
Remember, if you buy Apple, you have two views immediately.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,620
You have a view that Apple is going to increase,

125
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,500
but you also have a view that the market is at least not going to fall out from

126
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,060
the bottom. Remember, the market goes down. Apple's going to go down with it.

127
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,520
So you have a view on both off the bat.

128
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,060
But what you could do is you could buy Apple and short the S&P.

129
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,700
And when you would make money is if Apple outperforms the S&P. Right.

130
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,420
The S&P goes up 10 percent. Apple goes up 20 percent.

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,780
You would capture that difference, which is really what your view is. Right.

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
So you're trading Apple relative to the market.

133
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,480
So once we have that view, right. And why would we do that?

134
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,820
Why you why would we just not go and buy Coca-Cola, right,

135
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
or go and buy Apple and not worry about everything else? Well,

136
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,300
by by taking the other side of the trade. Right.

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,620
So you have two legs in a relative value position. You usually have two legs.

138
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,660
That's not always the case, though. OK. You usually have two legs.

139
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,410
So why not just go and if Apple is cheap, why not just go and buy Apple? Well,

140
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:13,180
by selling the other leg, it reduces our risk. Right. Instead of, let's say,

141
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,600
if we're buying Pepsi and the whole industry goes down, well,

142
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,400
Pepsi's going to get smoked as well. Right.

143
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,440
And even though we were long the equity, we could still lose money. Right.

144
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,290
Even though our vision was correct. But we can reduce that exposure by selling,

145
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,050
let's say, Coca-Cola. And therefore, if the market goes down,

146
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,310
then as long as the spread between Pepsi and Coca-Cola collapse, we make money.

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,700
You want me to draw that out? Yeah.

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,060
And we're going to show you guys this in the new terminal as well.

149
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,360
Once we just get chatting a little bit about it.

150
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,340
And once we bring the ball into the picture. Yeah.

151
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,470
So here is we're going to call this pep. OK. And we're going to draw a Coke.

152
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,580
OK. So here's Coke.

153
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,720
OK. Now, what we notice, though.

154
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,440
So right now we can see like the two assets are correlated.

155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,270
They're moving together. Right. They're moving together. And we can say, OK,

156
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,830
well, this is the spread is normal. Maybe if we looked,

157
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,310
if we let's say we subtracted the two stocks,

158
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,230
it would look something like this. Right. It would look something like this.

159
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,710
Where there's a small deviation, right, in the spread.

160
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,990
And every time it goes up here, for example, right, we could make a trade.

161
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,150
And when it goes down here,

162
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,490
we could also make a trade now because we're betting on it coming back together.

163
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,350
Right. Now, imagine we see all of a sudden and this happened on AMD and Intel,

164
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,250
actually, we did take a trade on it. All of us.

165
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,790
I think I think Hutch is actually alive and he was or we did it on IWM and the Q's.

166
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:07,240
Yeah. That wasn't false. Yeah. So imagine we see this. Right. Well, a couple.

167
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
We have to be careful when we see something like this happen. Right.

168
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Because in this spread now, it would look like this. Right.

169
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,970
So we would have to really see what's going on. You know, right off the bat,

170
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,710
we would be like, OK, let's go and buy Coca-Cola. Right. Here's Coke.

171
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,520
This is pep. Right off the bat, we'd all say,

172
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,000
let's go and buy Coca-Cola and shorts and Pepsi. Now,

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,520
this is this is a naive way of thinking of it, because this breakdown here,

174
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,400
right. Technical term,

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,520
but this breakdown here just goes and shows you that there might have been a structural

176
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,770
change, right. Something might have structurally changed in Coca-Cola,

177
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,550
where the spread now going forward will look something like this instead.

178
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,740
Right. And this right here, guys, is the hardest part about relative value. OK,

179
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,500
this part right here, because it's easy to find these. OK,

180
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:17,800
but it's hard because sometimes it breaks down or a break to the upside. And,

181
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,940
you know, after some it usually happens after some big news,

182
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,380
the false breakout. Right. What do we do in that situation? Right.

183
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,520
And that's the that's the hardest part about relative value.

184
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
So any questions about that guy so far?

185
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,680
We're going to keep on we're going to keep on chugging along.

186
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,530
Classic Paris trading example.

187
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,750
Yeah. That's what it is.

188
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,770
So that's that would be a classic Paris trading example.

189
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,040
And so even if you look at like here, let me actually.

190
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:02,880
So if we even look at I'm just going to pull up Coke and Pepsi here, guys,

191
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,260
on the screen so you guys can take a look.

192
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,630
I'm not sharing this, though, right? Oh, wait. Yeah. Yeah. Good catch.

193
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,190
Guys, you know what I noticed? There's no more. There's no. I mean,

194
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,610
I used to block her and now there's no more Estonian women popping up here anymore.

195
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,540
It's the best part of the lives. I know, man.

196
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,560
So let's let me get this on a line chart, guys,

197
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,760
just so we can better see this and get rid of these these moving averages.

198
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,310
So let's take a look.

199
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:58,790
So here is the spread between Coca-Cola and Pepsi for a three year look back.

200
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:05,190
OK, so you can see here, right, guys, it's quite easily, you know,

201
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,640
it's quite easily stays in this range. Right.

202
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,600
And we actually drop this down a bit. But when we're actually trading this,

203
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,400
right, look what happened here. Here is an example of a structural shift.

204
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,480
Right. We would get in right here.

205
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,280
This is where we would get into this position. And it continued to move down.

206
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,570
Right. It's the new there's a new mean in town. Right.

207
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,100
So before the old mean was right here. Right.

208
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,670
We could say it oscillates around this mean right here. Right.

209
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,510
But now it looks like this mean has changed.

210
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,010
There's a new structural there's there's going to be a new mean right to structural

211
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,350
shift. And this looks like and this might be the mean going forward. Now,

212
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,690
this right here, this data alone is not very good,

213
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,090
but it's just to show you guys an example. Okay. In reality,

214
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,850
and we actually have this in the terminal called, you know,

215
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,050
I'm not going to talk about it today,

216
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,690
but it's called the vector error correction model.

217
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:11,610
We try to make more sense of this data. OK,

218
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,350
so we try to account for these structural shifts and try to get an idea of where

219
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,100
should this thing be trading at or where should this spread be trading at?

220
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,220
OK,

221
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,100
we actually put this on a longer time frame so you guys can get a nicer picture

222
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,360
here.

223
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:34,490
Look at this. Right. This spreads all over the place. OK,

224
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,650
so in part of quantitative finance here,

225
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,660
it's actually trying to take this and make more sense of it. OK,

226
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,840
so that is trading the stock price in relative value terms.

227
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,880
But as you guys know, we're vol traders.

228
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,800
And so we got we can do this exact same thing in vol.

229
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:05,520
OK, so let us pull up the new terminal and take a look. Well, actually,

230
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,740
maybe let's chat about it first.

231
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,060
Stopping. Yeah. OK, so let's before we even look at the data,

232
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,560
let's let's quickly chat about involving relative value terms.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,180
So there's two ways we can trade this, you know, because we're trading vol,

234
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
there's more dimensionality.

235
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,340
It's a little more complex than just buying and selling stock. Right.

236
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,120
Which only make money up or down. Right.

237
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:38,540
There's no there's no curvature or convexity to the options. So to the stock.

238
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,830
So let's talk a little bit about the options trading vol through a relative value

239
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,410
trading. So let's say, you know,

240
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,080
we have two exact stocks or let's say two exact ETFs,

241
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:03,520
S&P 500 ETF and you pro or let's even go simpler and say S&P 500 versus another

242
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:12,500
S&P 500 ETF. OK, so we got two ETFs, S&P SPY and then IVV, I think,

243
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,950
is the other S&P ETF. Yeah. Yeah. IVV and SPY. Now,

244
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,190
we should see that these don't ever diverge. Right.

245
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,110
The volatility of these things should be exactly the same.

246
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,650
If if SPY goes up 5 percent, IVV should go 5 percent.

247
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,430
If SPY goes down 5 percent, IVV should go down 5 percent.

248
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:37,240
The vols should stay consistent across time. Now, that is the realized vols.

249
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,480
OK, so we have two dimensions here.

250
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,050
We're going to have the realized volatility. OK,

251
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,530
and we have the implied volatility spread,

252
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,890
the realized vol spread and the implied vol spread.

253
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,250
And we're going to come back to this in a second.

254
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,320
So when we're talking about the realized vol spread, right,

255
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,480
it's how much does one stock move relative to the other stock?

256
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,800
So IVV versus SPY should have their there should be no divergence.

257
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,020
You should always be the same. Otherwise, it's arbitrage. Right.

258
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,360
It's an arbitrage, the same asset. If they're not,

259
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,760
if they're moving more than 1 percent, let's say SPY is moving 1 percent and,

260
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,760
you know, IVV is moving 2 percent. Well, we can obviously make a trade there.

261
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,910
And that's called the realized volatility spread. OK,

262
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,870
what does one asset realize versus another asset?

263
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,530
Then there's the implied vol spread,

264
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:41,080
which is what is one asset implying versus the other asset? OK. Example,

265
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,700
SPY is trading at 30 implied vol, IVV is trading at 35 implied vol.

266
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,100
One ETF is saying the realized volatility is going to be 30 percent,

267
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,980
while the other ETF is saying it's going to be 35 percent.

268
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,870
So we can make a trade there because the realized vol spread should be zero,

269
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,220
even though the implied vol spread is five points.

270
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,760
OK, you guys, are you guys with me?

271
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,830
It's making sense. Making sense. OK, good, good. Now,

272
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,970
the last the last thing we can trade this is we don't need to think about it in

273
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,330
terms of realizing implied vol. We can just look at it in terms of implied vol,

274
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,290
where we say, OK, well, this asset's implying 50 percent, but it usually,

275
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,670
sorry, let's say that these two assets, right,

276
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,870
the implied vol spread between them is usually 5 percent,

277
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,010
but now it's 10 percent. So we can come in and make a trade. OK,

278
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,370
so let's go and take a look at the term. The new term,

279
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,630
my favorite part of every live now.

280
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,680
We're going to find it.

281
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:14,280
Is that it? That's the one. All right, guys,

282
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
here it is. Oh, baby.

283
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,780
Boom. OK,

284
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,860
so we're going to head over to the relative value tab here we have now.

285
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,140
So let's think about it in terms like this, guys. Right. We got two stocks,

286
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,920
SPY and I think it's IVV. We'll find out. We're going to find out.

287
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,660
And we're going to look at the implied volatility in the 30 days between these two

288
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,830
over one year. And we're looking at it as a ratio. Yeah.

289
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,550
So you guys can see here, right? The base.

290
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,110
So this is the one meaning that the one in one has been on this one right now.

291
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,690
I'm not right now,

292
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,800
but I can definitely I'm going to be adding that to the thing. Oh,

293
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,950
so you can see the blue is the SPY and the green is I is IVV. Right.

294
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,810
And you can see it basically never diverges. Right. It's exactly the same.

295
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,230
Otherwise, it's a pure arbitrage.

296
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,850
Right. So the question would be, for example, imagine we saw a situation, guys,

297
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:41,030
where SPY vol was all the way up here and IVV vol was all the way down here.

298
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,990
Yeah. Like let's say the graph looks something like this.

299
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,440
The blue line actually connected like this. Right. Green line's still up there.

300
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,000
Now, you know, a rookie trader would say, well,

301
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm going to go and sell SPY volatility because it's so high. Right. So high.

302
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,960
But what if that's the more efficient leg? Right.

303
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,010
What if SPY is actually more efficient than IVV? Right. So we don't want to go.

304
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,150
Why not? Why don't we come in and buy IVV? Right.

305
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,650
And so that's the whole concept here,

306
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,430
where when we see something diverge like this,

307
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,690
we can actually pack on more size. Right. Think about it like this, guys.

308
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:34,270
If you sold S&P up here and your reasoning was if you sold S&P up here, OK,

309
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,570
and your reasoning was implied volatility is too high right now,

310
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,290
it's probably going to come down in the future. Well,

311
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,470
how much size could you really put on? Right. Probably not a lot,

312
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,960
because if you're wrong, you get blown out of the water.

313
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,780
Now, a professional would come in and say, well, I can sell this and buy this.

314
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,940
And I can put on as much size as I possibly can.

315
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,680
I can borrow to put on this trade. Right.

316
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,670
And that is that that is the beauty of relative value is we can find these relationships

317
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:18,560
in the market. Right. That are that are gone haywire and we can make a trade.

318
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,780
Right. So you guys can see here, for example, right. You know,

319
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,320
during the first spike on the corona crash, eyeballs diverged a little bit.

320
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,120
Right. It might have been too hard to take advantage of.

321
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,360
So if we turn this to absolute terms.

322
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,640
So right now it's a ratio, meaning one divided by the other.

323
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,780
And now absolute means one minus the other.

324
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,110
Right. So if you guys look here, we only got one point. Right.

325
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,140
It only diverged by one percent. That's not enough. We have transaction costs.

326
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
We have slippage. We have bid ask spread.

327
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,860
That's probably not enough to take advantage of. Right.

328
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,740
Even even this two point spread here might have been really tough.

329
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,620
We might have given up a vol or two just to get into the position and out of the

330
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,410
position. So this exact position, we wouldn't be able to find any trade here.

331
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,890
But this is expected. Right. This is arbitrage.

332
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,290
This is arbitrage that would be existed.

333
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,970
Yeah. So, Marcos, this is a really, this is a really good. Marcos is saying,

334
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:38,360
well, can we look at the can we look at the leveraged ETNs? Right.

335
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,400
And this is actually something I'm doing a little bit of work on right now,

336
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:46,640
Marcos. But you actually see they're very, very close together.

337
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,310
I think this is 3x leverage, though, right, Marcos?

338
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,090
Are you saying it's the inverse? Yes. 3x inverse leverage.

339
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,930
So we should. So you can see, Marcos, right,

340
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,370
there are there are periods where this gets out of line,

341
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,420
where this gets out of whack. Right. Because we should see here,

342
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm going to do it SPXS instead of SPY,

343
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,820
just so you guys can see this more clearly.

344
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,410
So we would think that SPY,

345
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:37,300
SPXS should be trading at three times more vol than SPXS. Sorry.

346
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,140
SPXS should be trading at three times more vol than SPY. Right. Right.

347
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,360
So this white line right here. But what do we notice? Well,

348
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,140
we notice that it's actually a bit higher. It's actually 3.5% is the average.

349
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,320
Right. So this is pretty consistent. So there must be something going on here.

350
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,440
Right. And so that would be our job to figure out, well,

351
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,320
why is this trading at 3.5 times vol?

352
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,220
This is actually something that I'm working on right now, Marcos,

353
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,240
because I think there are inefficiencies in the 3x leveraged vol products.

354
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,260
So, you know, this is an example of where we can use relative value. Right.

355
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,480
We can see, OK, well, every time it touches the four mark. Right.

356
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,150
This is usually at the extreme level. So every time it gets close to there,

357
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,470
we want to start putting on a trade.

358
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,610
We want to start selling vol and SPXS and buying vol and the S&P.

359
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,510
OK, Steven, it's actually it's a little bit more than that.

360
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,540
It's not just the compounding effect.

361
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,470
And it's not actually the inefficiency is not really at the money.

362
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,630
It's actually in the tails. But that's for us for another day.

363
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,320
So the other thing we can look at, guys, is the realized volatility spread.

364
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
Now, unfortunately, I don't have that in the terminal today,

365
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,100
but that's going to be in there very, very soon.

366
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,690
So we would be able to see what is the realized spread. Right.

367
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,250
And if we graph the realized spread,

368
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,030
you guys would see that it actually is above three,

369
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,380
meaning that the implied vol spread is actually doing a good job of predicting the

370
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,260
realized vol spread.

371
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,600
OK,

372
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,410
pretty cool.

373
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,060
Anything else you want to show them here?

374
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,290
Correlation? Yeah, I guess we can take a look at this. Right. So here,

375
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:44,710
for example, guys, we can, you know, we want to take a look at SPY, right?

376
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,910
And SPXS.

377
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,050
Or let's look at something more interesting, like two fang stocks or something.

378
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,830
OK, OK, OK. So that Apple and Amazon. Gotcha. Or something like that. Gotcha.

379
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,980
Gotcha. Apple and Apple and Microsoft. OK, so we're gonna take a look at this.

380
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,320
Apple, Apple, Microsoft. OK,

381
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:19,420
so here we can see, guys, the rolling correlation between. So the thing is,

382
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,520
we have before we're going to make a trade on two assets,

383
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,520
we want to make sure that there's a relationship there.

384
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,090
But if there's no relationship, we can't perish trade Apple and some penny.

385
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,810
STNG. Yeah, STNG or INL, right?

386
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,900
We can't do that because we might get fucked on both legs. Right.

387
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,080
So for that reason, we need to make sure that some relationship exists.

388
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,960
And so we could what we could look at is one metric is the 90 day correlation between

389
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,580
the two stocks.

390
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,370
So you can see right now they are about was a number 70 percent. Right.

391
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,870
Apple and Microsoft right now are 70 percent correlated.

392
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,570
And there's a reason for this. Both of them make up the majority of the Nasdaq,

393
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,910
make up the majority of a bunch of ETFs.

394
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,450
And if investors are going out and buying these ETFs, right,

395
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,270
then the ETF has to go buy Apple,

396
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,350
Microsoft and investors go and sell these ETFs.

397
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,970
They have to go sell Microsoft and Apple.

398
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:22,690
So it makes sense that this correlation, this this relationship should exist.

399
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,570
And so we can make a perish trade on here if we saw some opportunity,

400
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,590
both in the vol space or in the Delta one space.

401
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,320
Another very, very useful metric is, well, when Apple moves,

402
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,300
how much does Microsoft move? How much does Microsoft move? Right.

403
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,160
So we can get a beta. OK, so in this case, for example, what we got left here,

404
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,320
0.62. So Microsoft has a beta of 0.62 to Apple.

405
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,160
OK, what else here? So we can look at the implied vols graph,

406
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,220
let's say for Apple, Microsoft. You can actually, by the way, guys,

407
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,160
you can plot four stocks. Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,880
Because the reason why we have four is because we're going to we're going to have

409
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,070
it. So you can plot Apple, Microsoft, implied vols and realized vols. Right.

410
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,550
So then you can see both spreads.

411
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,960
So let's take a look here. So when, let's say,

412
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,560
Apple vol goes 1.5 and we might say that's too expensive. Right.

413
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,340
And once we have the realized vol graph here, guys,

414
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,620
you guys will be able to understand why. Want to throw the realized vol on it?

415
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,760
I don't. I have to pull it. I don't. Yeah. I mean, I hear. OK. Let me see.

416
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,140
We can do it super quick here, guys. No, no. No. OK.

417
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,590
So that's that's that's basically the introduction on relative value,

418
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,250
relative value. OK, I'm going to end the recording here. Let's hop into a Q&A.

419
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,710
Any questions you guys have? Let's tackle them now.
