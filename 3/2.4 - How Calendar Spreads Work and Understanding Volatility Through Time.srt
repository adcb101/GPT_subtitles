1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,160
Okay, guys, so in this live,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,840
we are going to be going over calendar spreads in depth. How to use them,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,100
why they work, but not just why they work. Also,

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,840
we're going to talk about time, how volatility moves through time, right?

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,820
This is a gold topic. It's a very advanced topic, but it's crucial.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
For a lot of you, it's the final piece to the puzzle. Okay. Now,

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,120
before we get started,

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,720
the reason why we're doing a gold topic tonight is we actually have our first two

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:40,260
gold members tonight. And they are, so it's Jeka, oh my gosh, LOL, it's Jay,

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,540
and Ned, otherwise known as Bingo.

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,890
I want to give a huge congratulations to them. They did fantastic on the test.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,390
The work ethic that we've seen from these guys in the last two weeks,

13
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,810
in the last month, it's just been through the roof. For those of you,

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,310
if you go look at any point during the trader chat,

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,330
you'll see Ned and Jeka just grinding away.

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,210
They're doing some really advanced stuff in R.

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,030
They're really trying to dig down the material.

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,850
I went over their trade journals. They've done some very in-depth trades,

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,410
all the way from risk reversals to relative value,

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,330
all the way to the opposite side of the chain,

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,150
doing straight up iron condor shortfall. The amount of effort,

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,690
if you guys saw their trade journal, it just blew me away.

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,290
I'm just so happy for these guys. They crushed. They grinded.

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,030
They grinded so hard. And I also want to say,

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,510
this is actually really exciting as well, so Ned is very new with us, but Jeka,

26
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:49,300
his P&L, real money has been, it's just, it's speechless. I'm just so,

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,720
so excited for these guys to see what's going to happen with them in just a year.

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,840
They've learned so much already in a month, two months,

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,510
and I just can't wait to see what happens going a year forward. Wow. Yeah.

30
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,650
So reach out to them, guys. They're very knowledgeable. They're young bucks,

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,270
22? Yeah. 22. They're young bucks. 21, man. Yeah. So reach out to them,

32
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,880
and they're definitely on their way to making it in this game. Okay.

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,380
So with that said, guys,

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,820
we're going to jump right into the live and get going on calendar spreads and how

35
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,140
these work.

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,000
So the way we're going to start this live off first is I want to ask you guys a

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,120
question. What do we use calendars for? If I had to ask you guys,

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,440
what would you use a calendar for?

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,000
What risk exposures are we expressing or do we have on when we have a calendar spread?

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,260
What do you guys think?

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,410
So you put on a calendar spread, and the calendar spread,

42
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,270
for those of you that don't know,

43
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:53,940
we're selling an expiration and buying a different expiration. Okay? Okay.

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,060
So Ned's saying we're long vega, and Anne and Alan are saying time. Okay?

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,540
Okay. So. Okay. We're saying decreasing in the future. Okay.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,480
So what we're first going to do here is we're going to take a look at the position.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,060
Okay? What is it? How is it constructed? How is it constructed?

48
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,530
What our risks are at inception. Okay? So let me just open up thinkorswim here.

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,830
I'm going to share the screen.

50
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,210
Okay. So when we're doing a calendar spread, right,

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,750
we're going to be trading two different expirations, right? We're,

52
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,390
it's called a calendar because it's through time.

53
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,260
So the usual calendar spread would, let's say, sell a front month option.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,730
So if we're looking at, let's say Apple, okay,

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,100
we would sell a front month option and buy a back month. So in this case,

56
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,120
let's go and sell the Jans, the one 22 fifties,

57
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,010
and we're going to buy the April one 22 fifties.

58
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,650
And are we just trading a single option there? Are we trading like a,

59
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,670
something different within each expiration? How has it done? Yeah.

60
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,880
So it's just going to be a single option. Okay. So in this case,

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,980
you guys can see right here,

62
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,130
we are selling the Jan buying the April's and we're going to go to one 22 50.

63
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,470
Okay. So this spread is going for $5 and 50 cents, but that's aggressive.

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,720
I must have had some short ball on, on Apple. Okay.

65
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,240
So here's our calendar spread guys.

66
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,220
And you know, if anyone here has experience with tasty trade, right?

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,580
We are told that it's used when we think volatility will increase, right?

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,960
It's a, it's a long Vega position, right? We can see right here. Okay.

69
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
If we look at the middle row here,

70
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,560
we can see how our Vega position is changing. So this middle row right here,

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,670
okay. We can see that our Vega is 135. So we would think right off the bat,

72
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,890
well, we're a long volatility. We want volatility to expand and a naive,

73
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,510
a rookie trader would come in and say, okay, well, if I,

74
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,680
let's say increased volatility, 10 points, I'm going to make a lot of money,

75
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,970
right? Because we're long that Vega. But in actual fact,

76
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,410
the different expirations do not move the same way. Okay.

77
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,990
Do they do not move the same way?

78
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,850
And we're going to actually go do an exercise here.

79
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,590
And so I put together an Excel sheet for you guys to go over this with me.

80
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,610
I think you guys will find this extremely, extremely exciting and intuitive.

81
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,120
But before we do that,

82
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,640
does everyone understand what a calendar spread looks like?

83
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah, exactly. Steve, Steve's having a good joke.

84
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,220
It's like a rookie tasty trader would sell vol and then buy a whole bunch of calendars

85
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,280
to hedge. What, you know,

86
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,940
I've seen done before because I think they're long Vega. Okay.

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,870
So we all get it. Now let's head over then to, let's head over to,

88
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:32,070
here we go guys, here we go. So I want to,

89
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,790
what I did here was I got all of Apple's implied volatilities. Okay.

90
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,330
So we've got a couple of columns here, guys. On the first column,

91
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,230
we have the month. So the month until expiration. So for example,

92
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,370
this is a one month option. This is the two month option,

93
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,830
and this is the 12 month option. Okay.

94
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,850
And these are the implied volatilities at the beginning.

95
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,060
So let me just head back over to Apple. So you can see the one month option,

96
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,180
okay. Has implied volatility.

97
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,560
When I was looking at these earlier, it was 45, but the one month options,

98
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,880
let's say have implied volatility of 45. Okay.

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,700
And we're going to say the back month options have an implied volatility of 30.

100
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,930
So if we graph this, okay,

101
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,350
we graph this, this is what the term structure looks like.

102
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,480
All right. So again, the PA terminal,

103
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:52,590
if we head over to Apple and we

104
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,450
look at the term structure.

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,080
Okay.

106
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,560
So this obviously is a little different than what we have here,

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,280
but you see how we have different expirations and different implied volatilities.

108
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
So that's what I have graphed right here. Okay. Here's the first month option.

109
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,120
Okay. So expiring in, let's say 30 days, and then we have the 12 month option.

110
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
Okay. And this would look maybe like,

111
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,580
let's say there's an earnings event coming up where the near dated options are more

112
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,120
expensive than the further dated options. Okay. And we could see that,

113
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,290
for example, we can see something similar on Tesla,

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,430
right? So here we go. Okay.

115
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,760
You see how the near dated options are expensive and the far dated options are a

116
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,460
little cheaper in terms of implied vol.

117
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,240
So this is what we have. Now the way these options move, though,

118
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,840
is a lot different than a lot of people might think. They might think, okay,

119
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,340
if implied vol comes down 10%, right,

120
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,450
this whole thing is going to move down 10%. Okay.

121
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,530
But this is what actually happens.

122
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,340
Volatility, okay, is going to move in a square root fashion. Okay.

123
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:20,700
It's called root time. Okay. Now, what does this mean? Let's say we change,

124
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:28,780
okay. So let's say we'd go from, let's say the front month options increase by,

125
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,740
let's say, 20 points. Okay. Big news comes out.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,340
Something's going to happen like now. Yep. Right. Vol shoots up. Yeah.

127
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,500
That's another good way. Let's say market crashes and this is the S&P. Okay.

128
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Big spike down. News comes out. Coronavirus. So vol spikes the front 20 points.

129
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,570
Well, this is actually how the rest of the term structure is going to move.

130
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,330
So for example, the second month is only going to increase 14%.

131
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,290
The third month is only going to increase 11%. Okay.

132
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,090
So let's graph these out so you guys can see here.

133
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,050
And so funny. Always works.

134
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:42,980
Always works when you're doing it on this side here. Ned, where are you at,

135
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
Ned? He said trying to do two series. Yeah.

136
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Strange. It was literally just working. Said do what you did again.

137
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,180
So go insert.

138
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,430
Oh, here we go.

139
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,290
So here we go. Right. So we're going to, let's see. Okay. If we drop this,

140
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,610
let's say,

141
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,950
so right now they're the same and let's say implied volatility spikes 10%.

142
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,370
Okay. Well, this is what's going to happen.

143
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,590
The front is going to move up 10 points,

144
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,580
but the back is only going to move up 2.8 points. Okay.

145
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,680
That being said on the flip side, if we go down, let's say negative 20 points,

146
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,020
okay. This is what's going to happen.

147
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,060
This is how the term structure is going to move. Now a lot of people might say,

148
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,280
no. So before we keep going on here, continuing guys, we have a second sheet.

149
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Do you guys understand what's happening here? Okay.

150
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,540
Remember volatility is equal to,

151
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:54,530
okay. Remember this guys, volatility equals standard deviation. Okay.

152
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:01,750
Square root time. Okay. Where time is, let's say one month over 12 months,

153
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,090
right? This is for the first month. Okay.

154
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,330
Or let's say second month over third month or a second month. Right.

155
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,730
So it'd be two over 12. So you see how it's volatility, right?

156
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,290
Standard deviation moving through time. Right.

157
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,160
And that is why if we look at the formula for this, okay.

158
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,020
If we look at the formula,

159
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,060
okay.

160
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,460
We have annualized vol divided by square root month to expiration divided by 12.

161
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,560
Okay. Because the volatility is moving through root time fashion. Okay.

162
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,120
Now this is only the, the only, this is not even the most interesting part.

163
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,380
We're going to get to the most interesting part,

164
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,360
but let's just make sure we're all on the same page here.

165
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,230
Can you explain why the curve changes shape? Yes. Okay. Steve,

166
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,270
really good point. So Steve's saying, well,

167
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,570
why is it that when ball drops this, like let's drop it even more,

168
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,950
let's drop it 30 points.

169
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,470
Why is it that this gets smoked, right? But then this stuff only drops,

170
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,530
you know, it doesn't like flip, right. You know, it's like,

171
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,330
it doesn't go concave, but just the front really drops.

172
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,150
And that's because Steve, this is dropping by more than these are dropping,

173
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,290
right? This is these, this was above all of the ones behind it.

174
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,770
And now it's going to be below all the ones behind it. Right.

175
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,950
And that's why you're going to get that flip. Right. Think about like this.

176
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,950
You got two things here. It's up here. Imagine we didn't move this at all.

177
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,460
And this dropped. Right. Well, now it's going to look like this. Right.

178
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,120
So if we're going like this, Steve, right, this is what's actually happening.

179
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,510
We're starting up here. And as we come down, this is coming down faster.

180
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,770
So that's why we're getting that curves flip.

181
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes. Okay. Eric. Great. So Eric,

182
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,380
that's going to be where it gets really interesting.

183
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,540
Oh, okay. So Steve's okay. So let's drop it. Maybe five points. Steve,

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,250
you're saying, or let's go eight points. So it actually looks meaningful.

185
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,810
So here it's still dropping. It's not dropping enough for it to get that flip.

186
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,010
Okay. It's still this, it's still above the second month. Okay.

187
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,230
And as we change, okay, as we go, let's say negative 30 or 32,

188
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:39,280
let's say negative 30. Right. There's that big flip.

189
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,360
Now, so some people might say, okay, well, if I have a calendar spread on,

190
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,260
right, imagine we're doing this calendar spread.

191
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,760
Let me make this a little bigger. Just not a cool point.

192
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,620
Yeah. Right. It's not, it's not linear. It's not a linear measure. Right.

193
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,300
Like take a look at the change here.

194
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,080
Right. It's not linear. Right. If I change this.

195
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,620
Right. It's not linear. And so for that reason,

196
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,460
we're not going to have linear moves in the underlying and we're going to have it.

197
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,100
It's going to be curvy.

198
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,460
Okay. Now people, some people might say, okay,

199
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:39,520
well if I have a calendar spread on, okay,

200
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,040
so this is the term structure when we initially put on the calendar spread.

201
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:51,590
So let's say we come in here and we sell this and actually, and we buy this.

202
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,060
Okay. Well, the naive approach would be if volatility increases,

203
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,360
we're going to make money. Right.

204
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:11,880
So let's go up 20 points and you can see we increased, okay,

205
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:22,770
we increased, but this actually increased more than this.

206
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,550
Okay. And then, well, some people might say, okay, well,

207
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,810
I'm going to put on a calendar spread where I think vol is going to decrease because

208
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:40,030
this is going to decrease more than this. Okay. So we show that here.

209
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,690
Let's drop this 10 points or negative 10 Vegas. Right. Some people might say,

210
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,110
well, you know,

211
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,230
I sold up here or should we drop it even more to make it really,

212
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,860
I sold vol up here.

213
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,570
And I bought vol back here and I got this massive move and I got this,

214
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,410
I only got this little move. So my short leg,

215
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:13,030
cause I'm short volatility here should have made a lot more money. Okay.

216
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,330
And this is where Vega comes in.

217
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,610
So let's move to the next spread.

218
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,940
This is where Vega comes in. So what I've done here, guys, is I have,

219
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,000
so we have the same thing from,

220
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,900
we have the same pieces of information from last time.

221
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,000
And also for guys that trade like the earnings calendar spreads like Kyle I hope

222
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
you're starting to see where like the back month, you know, how,

223
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,100
like what should change, what should not change. Okay.

224
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,100
And we'll talk a little bit about that towards the end.

225
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,740
So we have the same thing here. Okay. We have our same thing here,

226
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,940
but look over here, guys,

227
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,940
what we have here is something a little different on our first column.

228
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,760
We have the months to expiration just like this.

229
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,090
And over here we have the Vega for the options contract.

230
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,760
So I did the one month option Vega, the two month option Vega,

231
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,100
the three month option Vega, four months, five months, six months.

232
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,580
And what we notice obviously, let me just plot this.

233
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,040
What we notice is that as we go through time, Vega increases,

234
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,230
Vega increases, but what is very cool about this?

235
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,600
Who can tell me what is very cool about this, about this chart?

236
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,650
Nobody, everyone's asleep. Everyone fell asleep tonight. Typical, typical,

237
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,940
typical. What is really cool about that chart?

238
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,410
Inverse to vol term structure? Nope. Dimas saying almost linear. Nope. Nope.

239
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,930
I want you guys to think, really think about that.

240
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,270
How vol moved previously in the previous section. Okay.

241
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,680
And inverses, okay.

242
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:41,090
So nope. So the answer is guys, there we go, Eric. There we go.

243
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,530
It also moves in the root of time, right? So check this out guys.

244
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,800
Vega divided by square root one over 12 is equal to 3956. Second month,

245
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:04,590
which is second month divided by square root two over 12 is 3950.

246
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,510
So adjusted for square root time, they all have the same Vega.

247
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,140
They all have the same Vega. So what does that mean? Well,

248
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,890
let's go back over here, guys. I want you to watch our P&L column now. Okay.

249
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,340
So what I did for this P&L column was I said, okay, the change in Vega here,

250
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,640
I'm sorry, the change in implied vol times our Vega, right? If we have,

251
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,260
let's say 1,100 Vega and we multiply it and we're short 10 Vegas, or sorry,

252
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,180
if we have 1,100 Vegas and we lose 10 implied vol points, well,

253
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,620
we're going to be down 11 grand, right? Oh, sorry. 1,000 or 11 grand.

254
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,700
So watch what happens guys. We're going to go and increase.

255
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,060
So we're going to go from 45 to 55.

256
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,590
We're going to go from 45 implied vol to 55 implied vol.

257
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:04,650
And look at our P&L guys. They're the same. They're the exact same.

258
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,480
Okay. Just let that sink in for a second.

259
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,470
If we change implied vol, the term structure is going to move,

260
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,210
but the way it's going to move is that it's going to,

261
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,520
they're all going to make the same amount of money. Okay. So far we're so good.

262
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,290
Is that, if that's a little confusing, I can slow it down.

263
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,190
We can chat about it.

264
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:32,930
Okay.

265
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,790
And we know guys, so we can, we can make sure we're all on the same page.

266
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,750
Don't be, don't be afraid to speak up.

267
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,760
Okay. And I'll just,

268
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,020
what is the formula again for the root time adjusted vega? Here it is. Okay.

269
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,900
It's Apple vega divided by square root, the month divided by 12, right?

270
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,920
Square root time. Okay. Just like this is month is two divided by 12.

271
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,940
So what we have here is in a change in implied volatility,

272
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,140
I should change across the whole term structure. Now the beauty of trading,

273
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,780
okay. Is that sometimes these moves don't happen. Okay.

274
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,360
Sometimes these moves don't happen. Now, most of the time,

275
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,530
these moves are going to happen. Okay. Fall is going to move in root time.

276
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,850
And what I mean by that is let's say we're looking at an earnings event. Okay.

277
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,320
After the earnings event is gone, they should all drop.

278
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:47,220
Meaning that the implied move was the same throughout the term structure. Okay.

279
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,960
So imagine this guys right now,

280
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,940
we're at 45 vol and it's an earnings event tomorrow.

281
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,280
And so let's say after the earnings event,

282
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,980
volatility for the front month drops by 20 points.

283
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,140
Well,

284
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,140
every single month is going to lose the same amount of money because they all have

285
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,780
the same implied move baked in. Otherwise it's an arbitrage, right?

286
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,780
Otherwise you can buy a cheaper implied move and sell a more expensive implied move.

287
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,610
Now, what happens though, is that sometimes these moves don't always work out,

288
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,240
right?

289
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,840
Let's say company releases a terrible earnings implied move drops in the front.

290
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,500
It drops across the whole term structure,

291
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:42,230
but this also signifies more volatility into the future, right?

292
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,210
Or it signifies more volatility in the next earnings event.

293
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,470
There's like a change in the term structure. Exactly.

294
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,350
So we don't get that root time movement.

295
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,290
And that's where the calendar makes money.

296
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,650
It makes money when non-root movements happen.

297
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:03,370
It makes or lose money when non-root moves happen, okay?

298
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,880
And there's other ways to, so there's other ways you can set up the,

299
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,380
so let me ask you guys this question. If you actually want to be long vol,

300
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,390
a calendar spread, okay? How would you structure it?

301
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,280
It's a trick question. How would you structure it?

302
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,760
That's saying sell front buy back. That's just the regular calendar spread,

303
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,920
right? Let's say if implied volatility does increase, you want to make money.

304
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,550
Wait it. What does that mean, Steve? What does that mean? Wait it.

305
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:07,720
Exactly. Exactly, Dima. So a regular calendar is called root time vega neutral,

306
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,620
okay? It's called root time vega neutral because any move,

307
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
any root move that happens, it's going to be,

308
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,430
it's not going to make or lose money, okay? It's called root time vega neutral.

309
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,560
Now if you want the position to actually make money when implied vol increases,

310
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,870
you have to be gamma flat, okay?

311
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,490
And so we're going to structure one out right now.

312
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,210
So to do this, you actually have to do a straddle versus straddle.

313
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,790
So here we have our short straddle,

314
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,600
okay? And then we're going to go back,

315
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,380
let's say we're going back to the March one again.

316
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,350
We're going to buy the straddle, okay? So you're on sale. Oops, thanks.

317
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,960
Okay, so now this looks like a regular calendar spread, right?

318
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,980
This looks like our calendar spread we were just talking about.

319
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,470
But this is root time vega flat, root time vega neutral.

320
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,600
In order to make this actually make money if implied volatility increases,

321
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,000
we need to make this gamma neutral. So you guys are going to see this here.

322
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,100
Watch this, okay? So look at our gamma. We're obviously short gamma, right?

323
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,280
Concave function. Watch what happens now.

324
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,960
Okay, we're picking up a little bit of delta,

325
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:47,420
but basically we are now in this position.

326
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,500
You're gamma flat and you're actually long vega. So if for example,

327
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,240
so we're going to do this together, guys. This is month one,

328
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,140
this is month three, okay?

329
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,820
If implied volatility moves up 20 points for month one,

330
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,340
that's the January contract, okay? That's what's going to happen.

331
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,180
But what's going to happen to the back? Okay, let's go back to our,

332
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,690
let's go back to our Excel sheet. Okay, so we said plus 20 points.

333
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,280
So that means month three is going to move at about 11 and a half points.

334
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,930
So watch this. Okay guys, watch this. We make a ton of money.

335
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,670
We make a ton of money, right? Five grand.

336
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,990
Now watch what happens if I make this root time vega flat,

337
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,210
a regular calendar spread.

338
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,380
Look at that guys. No P and L, no P and L change.

339
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,940
And that has the parameter changes, right? If we go to more parameters here.

340
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,760
Yeah. Right. Those are still on it.

341
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:03,560
There's no P and L change in our calendar spread. And this is, you know,

342
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,220
this is the, this is the reality of how calendar spreads actually work.

343
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,840
And this is why it's a gold topic.

344
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,040
And the only reason why Sean and I wanted to do this today was because congratulations

345
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,100
to our two brand new gold members.

346
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,380
So, so Stephen's saying, well, if you're gamma flat and long Vega,

347
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,860
you are short data. Yes and no.

348
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,080
So it really depends on what level of vol you're buying at, right?

349
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,040
The higher level of vol you're buying at,

350
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,680
the more theta is going to be embedded in it. So let's take a look. Steve,

351
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,100
let's take a look at this structure. What was it? 20, right? So this,

352
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,990
this is short data. Yeah. You're short data here. Okay. So as time goes by,

353
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,950
you're going to lose a little bit of money,

354
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,000
but it's not always the case, right? Sometimes you can sell at a crazy vol,

355
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,900
buy at a cheaper vol, right?

356
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,700
Especially when you're doing a relative value play. Like let's say what,

357
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,700
what Ned and I are working on, where synthetically we're almost long theta,

358
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,820
long gamma, long Vega, right? If you can find these trades where it's,

359
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,040
you know,

360
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,280
and obviously it's not arbitrage because IWM and SPY can move differently at any

361
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,060
given moment, but if you can find these trades where, you know,

362
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
one vol is really cheap and one vol is really expensive,

363
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,140
you can structure your book to be in our case, right?

364
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,500
If you look at the case between Ned and I, we are flat theta.

365
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:37,700
We have zero theta, but we have long gamma and long Vega. Okay. It's a,

366
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,220
it's a win-win until things stop moving, right?

367
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,920
Or until we're wrong until let's say SPY doesn't move and IWM shoots through the

368
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,120
roof.

369
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,340
Exactly. Exactly. Steve. Or, or implied vol,

370
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,960
the implied vol spread forces is out of the position. Okay.

371
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,680
So we're not always saying when you sell a strangle straddle in the front versus

372
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,340
the back and IV collapses, your P&L is bigger in the,

373
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,280
in the back than in the front.

374
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,210
Why is that then? So this is not true. It's not true. We're not.

375
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:19,910
So if you are a root time Vega flat and implied vol drops,

376
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,340
your P&L is going to be the same throughout. Okay.

377
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,760
It's going to be the same throughout. So it would only be,

378
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,470
it would only be unless you're saying if you're doing them separate positions,

379
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:39,870
it would be the same thing, right? What we're betting on is non-root movements.

380
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,390
Okay. Non-root movements. That's what we're really betting on, right?

381
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,650
We're betting on, let's say for example,

382
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,510
if we're looking at an earnings calendar, earnings calendar trade,

383
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,400
we're looking at the back to the front to drop in the back to shoot up. Right.

384
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,280
Or the, just the front to drop. These are non-root movements.

385
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,900
So even if, so Renato, even if we have different positions,

386
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:10,730
one is not going to make more money than the other. Okay.

387
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,270
One is not going to make more money than the other.

388
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,330
The, so the area under the, it's actually, okay,

389
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,180
so the area under the curve is going to be different. Okay.

390
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,840
The area under the curve is going to be a little bit different. So with,

391
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,700
with the Vega, with the Vega trade, our P&L should be the same. Okay.

392
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,300
But what's going to happen is your width of your breakevens are going to be wider.

393
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,070
Okay. Whereas in the front,

394
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,530
your sensitivity to that time is going to be more important.

395
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,030
So imagine like this happens, Renato,

396
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:49,800
let's say you sell a 120 day straddle and you buy a or let's say we're on the same

397
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,700
side. So you sell a 10 day straddle and you sell a 200 day straddle.

398
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,590
Now tomorrow your theta P&L is going to be a lot more important to the front month

399
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,680
expiration. And let's say implied vol drops, root time, your,

400
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,080
your 200 day straddle is going to have more width. Okay.

401
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,400
It's going to have the break evens are going to be a lot wider, right?

402
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,340
But your,

403
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,200
your straddle in the front actually increased in height due to that time factor,

404
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,640
that time decay. Okay. And let me just, let me just, uh,

405
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,420
I know it's a little bit advanced guys, but. That's why it's gold topic.

406
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,380
That's why it's gold topic. Right.

407
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,560
And this is why it's so important when you guys are in silver to really get a grasp

408
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,520
of it because what's coming in gold is, uh, is it's big news bears. Okay.

409
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,560
So Renato, watch this.

410
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:52,230
You see that, see that height pop, right? Look at this height pop. Okay.

411
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,160
Now watch what happens Renato when we go way back.

412
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,930
So here is our long dated option. Okay. Here's,

413
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,850
here's our break even right now. Watch this height pop.

414
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,450
There's none.

415
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,640
There's none. Right. But watch what happens Renato when we drop fall,

416
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,430
look at the width, look at the width on that Renato.

417
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,180
Can't even get it on the page. Can't get it on the page. Right.

418
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:44,410
So we get this extremely wide, uh, break even, but we get no height, right?

419
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,810
So that, that's the, that's the difference. Okay.

420
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,310
The difference is with the theta,

421
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,710
tomorrow's P and L is going to be based on that theta. When in the back,

422
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,230
you're going to get that, that width when the Vega drops. Okay.

423
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Does that make sense?

424
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,230
Sorry. Uh, sorry, Kyle. Thanks for, thanks for calling me out on their margin.

425
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,600
Okay. So, um, when we're looking at like, let's say an earnings trade, right,

426
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,900
an earnings calendar spread, and we get, uh, you know, sometimes we'll say,

427
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:30,380
okay, well if they release the announcements, um, the back should increase.

428
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,560
Well, that's not necessarily true.

429
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,580
What might actually happen instead is that the front is just going to decrease.

430
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,010
Okay.

431
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,010
And that's another reason why we see that pattern leading up into these earnings

432
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,390
events.

433
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,840
Okay.

434
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,520
Any questions, guys? That's going to be,

435
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,900
otherwise that's going to be the live it's eight 40. Yeah.

436
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,380
A little bit of a gold topic for the, for the new gold guys.

437
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,660
I'll have to give them their badge right after the, uh, yeah,

438
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,900
Renato send me a message, buddy.

439
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,470
Good stuff. Jekka. Marco's saying only use them on events. No.

440
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,070
So you want to use them, um,

441
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,500
Marco's wherever you think there's going to be a non-route time movement.

442
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,820
An example might be, um,

443
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,050
an example might be, uh,

444
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:58,280
let's say right now the term structure is looking like this term

445
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,470
structure is looking like this. Okay. Well,

446
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,890
we also need to think about the position, right? We're we're long theta here.

447
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,770
Okay. Short gamma.

448
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,930
And we're hedging that short gamma with some of this long Vega out here.

449
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,880
So you might think, for example, um,

450
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,290
Marco's that realize volatility is not going to move. Okay.

451
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,630
Realize volatility is going to be very low,

452
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,630
but implied vol is going to stay bid in the back, right?

453
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,510
This could be for many reasons. For example, once COVID started slowing down,

454
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:35,780
implied volatility in the back still wanted to stay bid because who knows what could

455
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,440
happen in the future.

456
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,640
But the near dated vol started dropping like crazy and not the implied,

457
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,740
but the realized. So what you could have done was say, okay,

458
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,940
well I'm going to sell some of this,

459
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,040
get that exposure to that short gamma long theta,

460
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,940
and I'm going to buy these back month options because this is going to lose a lot

461
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,960
of money, right? If the stock doesn't move,

462
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,400
this is going to lose a lot of money,

463
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,690
but this is still going to stay high in terms of implied vol. Okay.

464
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,960
So that's one way you can use them. And then let's say for an earnings event,

465
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,520
so sometimes I've been doing this recently,

466
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,970
you have an earnings event that looks like this.

467
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,360
Here's the front. Here's the back. Well, what I've noticed a little bit,

468
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,900
you know, is some stocks, this drops like crazy and this doesn't change.

469
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,110
This stays bid. So what I like to do is I try to figure out,

470
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,210
I try to price the back months here and I just go and sell the front, right?

471
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,410
Because what, what, what,

472
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,850
what this is telling us is that there's a big earnings move implied in here,

473
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,290
but there's no earnings move implied over here, right?

474
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,570
So obviously those are going to be fantastic trades.

475
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,180
So there's lots of different ways to use them.

476
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,190
That is just one example or two examples.

477
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,260
You're basically looking for an auto when you want to see implied moves across different

478
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,820
expirations change differently.

479
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,500
They're not root time movements and root time movements just being means normal

480
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:15,980
movement.

481
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:21,880
Okay.

482
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,570
Okay. Perfect. Everyone's passed out.

483
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,490
Everyone's going to get a good night's sleep tonight. Excellent.

484
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:40,180
Oh, Ariel. Thank you. You know, thanks for joining, man. We, we, we, we have,

485
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,100
we have a surprise guest, Ariel. He's just, he's dropping in,

486
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,490
taking a little peek into our, into our lives today. So nice to see you, buddy.

487
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,720
Okay. Well, if that's it, oh wait, last question here from Anne and Alan,

488
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,040
how long do you hold the position? Yep. So it really depends until you're,

489
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,530
it depends on until your, your view has come to fruition or when, you know,

490
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,610
before you enter the trade, right, we should always think of, okay,

491
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,690
when am I right? And what am I wrong? Right. And so if, if, if,

492
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,020
if the wrong thing happens, you have to exit the position. Right. And, but if,

493
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,340
if your, if your position does come to fruition,

494
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,120
then it's time to take off the trade. Right.

495
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,520
So let's say we're doing an earnings event and we don't think there's going to be

496
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,550
a root time movement in the vol surface. So once the earnings event is done,

497
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,500
right, if it's happened, or if it hasn't happened,

498
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,940
we're out of the position because we took this position.

499
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,460
We took this trade anticipating that after the earnings event is done,

500
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,100
this should happen. And if it didn't,

501
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,880
we were wrong and we have to admit that to ourselves and move on to the next trade.

502
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,230
Tico, send me a message, man. I won't have time to hop on a call,

503
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,950
but if you want to send me a message, if it's important,

504
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,250
then of course we'll jump on a call.

505
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,950
Okay. Everyone. Okay. That's the live for tonight. Once again, congrats, Jekka.

506
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,510
Congrats, Ned. Unreal stuff. Yeah. Really good stuff. Really, really.

507
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,650
Congratulations guys.

508
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,690
And tune in to see how Ned and I manage the relative value position.

509
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,650
So far it's pretty good. We're like 3% on capital.

510
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,270
And like not even talking about risk,

511
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,170
we're 3% on capital in like five days of trading on it. So, you know,

512
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,730
stay tuned for how the position evolves.

513
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:42,950
Ned is posting daily updates twice a day, I think morning and how it opens,

514
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,570
how it closes. Really good stuff. He's also messaging me with all the sweat.

515
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,730
He's dying. Every 10 minutes I get a new meme from him. That's so funny. Yeah.

516
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,270
The sweat. That's so good. Yeah. Okay. Okay, guys. Have a great night,

517
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:58,550
everyone.
