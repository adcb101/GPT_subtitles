00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,880
Hey guys, so in this live,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,180
we're going to be chatting about spot and eyeball correlation.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,380
And what we mean by that is, if let's say we're looking at the S&P 500,

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,860
if the stock goes up 1%, what happens to eyeball? The stock goes down 1%,

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,100
what happens to eyeball?

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,320
So that's what we're going to be chatting about today.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,240
So if implied ball goes up, then what's going to happen to spot?

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,620
And when we say spot, we mean the underlying. So when we say underlying,

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,660
we mean, let's say, for example, the spot price,

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,980
meaning the current price of let's say the S&P 500.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,280
So we call it the spot eyeball correlation,

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
and I'm just going to show it to you on the terminal.

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,310
So let's look at the ticker SPY,

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,180
and we're going to go to volatility. And we can see right here,

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,160
this is the picture we're looking at. Everyone see this?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,640
And so what this tells us is, if the S&P goes up 2%,

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,540
the implied volatility usually comes down. When the S&P goes down 2%,

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,880
we'll say implied volatility usually goes up about 15.6%.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,740
So that is what spot eyeball correlation is.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,320
Now the reason we need to talk about this is because it helps us structure our trades.

21
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,150
Okay. So we can use GME as an example. I think it's perfect. But does anyone,

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,670
before we continue, is everyone from understanding of spot eyeball correlation?

23
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,170
Because if we can't understand this, this is the fundamental building block.

24
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,710
We're getting there, Koaw.

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,940
Okay. Koaw is saying, please repeat. On the X axis,

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,700
we have change in share price, right? So this is no change in share price.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,100
This is plus 2% change in share price on this side, right? Plus 2 here,

28
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,580
minus 2 here. And then on this side, we have change in IV.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:30,730
So this down here would be like minus 20%, right? Up here would be plus 30%,

30
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,470
right? And what we're saying is, well, okay, let's say we have, you know,

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:43,160
a 2% day in the S&P. We should see volatility come down about 10%, right?

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,200
Not 10 points, 10%. So if implied vol is trading at 20,

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,260
it should come down to 18. And for different assets,

34
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,260
this correlation could look different. Yeah. Actually,

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,480
it's not always the same. That's actually a really good idea.

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,740
Let's take a look at Tesla just because we got Tico on the line here. And Tico,

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,540
I was just chatting to a pharmacist today.

38
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,710
I'd love to have a little call with you this week sometime. Okay.

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,130
So look at Tesla, right? When Tesla goes up, implied volatility goes up.

40
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,550
When Tesla goes down, implied volatility comes down. Okay.

41
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,810
And we're seeing this with a lot of names. Okay. We're seeing this with LIT,

42
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,210
right? Let's take a look at LIT. Okay. So look what's happening here, guys.

43
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm just going to do the implied volatility. Look at this.

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,380
As we see the stock rally, okay, we're also seeing implied volatility rally.

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,660
And when we see the stock coming down,

46
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,280
we also see implied volatility coming down.

47
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,170
Let's do a six month so you guys can really see it. Okay. Do you guys see that?

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,710
You see that correlation there? It's like identical. Right.

49
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,730
But what we see here is it's a lot.

50
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,930
So it's definitely a lot flatter than the S&P,

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,910
but it's still negatively correlated. But right now, currently,

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,510
we're seeing some correlation. Okay. Now, usually for an ETF,

53
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,670
we should see negative correlation. Stock goes down, implied vol goes up.

54
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,930
Right. If the ETF goes down, implied vol goes up.

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,790
But currently in the last three months, right, not even last two months,

56
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,530
we've seen if implied volatility goes up, the stock is usually up as well.

57
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,650
So does everyone understand implied vol versus spot correlation?

58
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,520
So is it an inverse correlation? So is it inverse to let's say the S&P? Yes.

59
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,560
Right. Not right now, not in the past. So usually, blessing.

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,710
So this is looking over two years of data. Okay.

61
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,310
If we look at two years of data, we see a negative correlation,

62
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,430
meaning that usually for lit, if it goes up, vols drop, if it goes down,

63
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,420
vols increase. Right. We see that. We saw that over here. Right.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,380
During the crisis. Right. Vols went up and the stock went down.

65
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,230
But right now it's acting a little different. Okay. Now for Tesla,

66
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,990
we see a stronger relationship that when S&P, when Tesla goes up,

67
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,040
implied vol goes up. Okay. Which we're seeing a stronger relationship there.

68
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,570
Okay. But for the S&P, it's completely the opposite.

69
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,700
Okay. Completely the opposite. Does everyone understand that? Yes. Arnold.

70
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,370
So each dot represents a day. Okay. So on this day right here,

71
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:57,830
S&P was flat or it was down 0.89% and vols were up 26%. Okay. Now, obviously,

72
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,630
maybe not obviously, let me ask you this question. Okay.

73
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,310
What do you think during this time period, right?

74
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,790
If I were to tell you what day this was, okay,

75
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,090
what do you think the VIX was trading at? So we're looking at the S&P here.

76
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,850
What do you think the VIX was trading at? So that when the S&P went down 0.89%,

77
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,060
VIX went up 26%. What do you think it was trading at? Let's see who's got this.

78
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,510
Come on, Steven. When I say, let's see who's got this, I'm explicitly saying,

79
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,910
please don't answer Steven.

80
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,880
Nice. Okay. So Steven's got it, right? So Kou is saying mid vol.

81
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
So it's actually going to be really low vol, right?

82
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,540
If the S&P is down half a percent and the VIX is spiking 26%,

83
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,720
we're in an extremely low vol environment. Maybe VIX is 10, maybe VIX is nine.

84
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,560
Okay.

85
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,890
No, it's definitely not blessing. Another question for you. Okay.

86
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,500
Biotech, biotech company, meme stock, biotech or a meme stock.

87
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,480
What do you think the relationship would be?

88
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,580
Kind of funky. It is. It is. Positive. Awesome. Blessing. Awesome. Awesome.

89
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,460
Awesome. As exactly that stands in. Perfect. When the stock rallies,

90
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,480
we see an increase in vol. So let's see, let's see if that's the case.

91
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,710
Let's see. Thanks, Hannah. Thanks for, thanks for bringing that one in. Okay.

92
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,660
Let's see here. So I'll take a look at GME. Okay. And we've seen this with GME,

93
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,180
right? When the, when the, when the, when the stock,

94
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,200
when the spot price goes up, implied vol goes up. Now, not that much,

95
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,480
but we are seeing that. Okay. So how can this,

96
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,130
why and where should we use this? Okay. Well,

97
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,150
let's think about it before we even,

98
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,310
I really want you guys to think about this stuff. Okay.

99
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:20,070
Let's say we see a positive correlation between implied vol and spot price.

100
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,660
Okay. And we are bearish on vols. We're bearish on vols.

101
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,110
How might we structure a straddle? Where would we place it?

102
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,720
Let's say the stock's trading at 50. Okay. We're bearish on vols. Okay.

103
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:48,070
But we also have this like implicit risk of direction, right?

104
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,100
It's like when you buy the S&P 500, you're actually short volatility, right?

105
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,680
That's why they say buying S&P or buying equity is a short vol trade.

106
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,730
So Jared's saying 40. So stock's trading at 50 and we're bearish on vols,

107
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,130
it has a positive correlation with spot price. Jared's saying 40.

108
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,410
Does anyone agree or disagree with Jared? What do you guys think?

109
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,070
What do you guys think?

110
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,460
So stock's trading at 50. Okay. And we want to sell a straddle. Okay.

111
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,550
So here's our P&L graph. Okay.

112
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,610
Here's 50. This is where the stock's trading at. Okay.

113
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,730
And let's say this is 30 and this is 20 and this is 70.

114
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,840
Where do we want to place our straddle and why?

115
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,120
So Blessing's saying, would you do a put spread then? Not necessarily.

116
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,820
Not necessarily. We want to get short a lot of vol,

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,780
so we wouldn't really want to do a put spread here.

118
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,240
I think it's going to be two directional. Stanton's saying an at the money.

119
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:23,510
Okay.

120
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,880
So Jared's saying straddle over here. Okay.

121
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,300
Stanton's saying straddle over here.

122
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,980
Okay. Steve, thanks for not saying your opinion. I really appreciate it.

123
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,860
I know you're sweating. Ronnie's saying place it above the strike.

124
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,780
Ronnie's saying place it above the strike. Okay.

125
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,580
So no one at PA can agree with anyone.

126
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,140
Okay. Since Koa, okay. So since Koa and Ronnie said above the strike,

127
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,100
we're going to go with that one as PA's decision.

128
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,060
And that would be the correct answer. Okay. That would be the correct answer.

129
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,920
Now, why would that be the correct answer? Okay. Well, we are bearish on vols,

130
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,290
right? We think vols are going to go down. Now, if volatility goes down, right,

131
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,770
what is likely going to happen to the spot price? Well,

132
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,630
it's likely going to go down as well, right? We said that they're correlated.

133
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,070
Let's say we're looking at GME, right? If GME starts to fall,

134
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,270
implied vol is going to get crushed. If GME continues to rise,

135
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,170
implied vol is going to continue to get larger and larger.

136
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,160
So we want to be positioned above spot price, okay?

137
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,960
And slightly leaning long deltas, okay? Because think about it like this.

138
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,000
If the stock goes down, we are going to earn on vega, right?

139
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,380
We're going to earn on short volatility. If the stock goes up, well,

140
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,290
if we are positioned below the strike, well,

141
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,370
we're going to lose on delta and we're going to lose on vega, right?

142
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,180
So being positioned above spot price is where we want to be. Now, also,

143
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,300
the other thing is stocks that are usually correlated with spot price,

144
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,280
or sorry, implied vols are usually correlated with spot price,

145
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,840
tend to have extreme high volatility, okay?

146
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,780
So we're going to use GME as our example here. Okay,

147
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,520
we're going to go into thinkorswim and we're going to take a look.

148
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,360
So just so you guys can see with lit, let's get rid of that.

149
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,640
I don't know how that got on the screen. I don't know, man.

150
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,920
So you guys can see with lit,

151
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,140
as the stock rallies and it gets more and more and more, boom, boom, right?

152
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,720
Implied vol is increasing with it. And now as the stock has been coming down,

153
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,180
so has the implied vols, okay? So let's take a look at GME.

154
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,500
I heard it's up after hours. Let me just quickly take a look here.

155
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,900
I like that big red candle.

156
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,860
Okay, so let's take a look here. GME trading at 43, okay?

157
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,840
Trading at 43 right now. This is where, this is the at the money strike.

158
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,790
The first thing we're going to realize is that the Delta 50 is actually way above

159
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,950
spot price. Okay. Now let's go and do and sell this straddle right here. Okay.

160
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,670
So we're selling a straddle way above spot price.

161
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,640
Let's take a look. Okay.

162
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,580
So before the close, it's up after hours.

163
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,280
So thinkorswim is going to be a little bit off, but before the close,

164
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,180
it was trading right around here. Okay.

165
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,810
Now let's see what's going to happen here. We're going to stress our position.

166
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,630
So if the stock were to go up, so we're going to, we're going to move this,

167
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,830
let's say up 10%. Okay.

168
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,550
And we're also going to have another scenario where the stock is down 10%.

169
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:26,130
Sorry guys. It's because after hours data, thinkorswim is down like 20%. Yeah.

170
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,090
Because like thinkorswim is using this right now. So no,

171
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:35,190
even that should be over here. I don't know. It's all messed up. Okay.

172
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,830
Whatever. We're going to use this as spot price.

173
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,770
So we're using the close data as spot price right now.

174
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,910
Thinkorswim has the close at $46, even though that's after hours data. Okay.

175
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:53,720
So let's, let's say we drop vols. So actually, sorry. Okay. So scenario one,

176
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,790
okay. The stock moves up to $49. If it does move up to $49, right,

177
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,630
we are going to see implied vols, let's say rally another 10%. Okay.

178
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:13,290
And so we are going to be losing money on vega and on delta, right?

179
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,770
But thankfully we get, let's say we get a little theta, right?

180
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,700
We're going to be okay.

181
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:28,900
Now on the flip side, if spot drops, we are going to earn on vega.

182
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,830
And so it's okay to be positioned slightly.

183
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,640
It's okay to be positioned slightly long delta because even if it does drop,

184
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,830
right, we're still going to earn.

185
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,380
All right. And just to show you guys another example here, let us do this.

186
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,060
Where do the strike is,

187
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,840
let's say 46, or we have a lot of short delta. Okay.

188
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:20,290
It's all messed up. There we go. There you go. If the stock were to rally,

189
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,250
right, 10%,

190
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,610
we'd be losing quite a bit on delta and our drop in vega or our increase in vega

191
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,790
would really damage us.

192
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,040
So that's why we want to have positioned above spot with slightly bullish view.

193
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,060
We're taking like twice the loss that we would be, right. Or more,

194
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,720
three times almost, it was like a thousand last time, right?

195
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,370
So we need to remember that when we do take on these trades,

196
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,390
we sometimes have an implicit directional view. We might say, well,

197
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,550
we're bearish on vols,

198
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,410
but we might only be bearish on by being bearish on vols.

199
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,170
We are implicitly saying, we think the stock is going to go down. Right.

200
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,030
If we're looking at, that's the key right there to really know, right.

201
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:14,400
That Ivy spot correlation tells you more about your view when you,

202
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,440
when you put on your trade, right.

203
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,940
If there's an extremely strong correlation where, you know,

204
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,860
implied volatility goes up when this stock goes down or, you know,

205
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,560
implied volatility go for this example,

206
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,520
implied volatility goes up when the stock goes up. Well, when you're short vol,

207
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:30,970
you know,

208
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,890
you clearly don't want the stock to go up because what happens when the stock goes

209
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,100
up, vols go up, right.

210
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,420
So it shows you about your relationship with Delta when you're taking that view

211
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,560
on implied volatility.

212
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,290
Hmm. So in this case, if GME were to trade down to let's say $30 a share,

213
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:58,760
implied vol would be likely, let's say back to 140, right. Or lower. Yeah,

214
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,950
it could go even lower. So we always need to keep that in mind when we're,

215
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,450
when we're trading volatility, right.

216
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,070
We sometimes have an implicit directional view, right? If we are long equity,

217
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,330
right, imagine you were long in the S&P 500. You were also saying,

218
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,360
I don't think there's going to be a lot of volatility, right?

219
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,470
Because if there is a lot of volatility, the S&P usually goes down. Okay.

220
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,510
And so to answer Ko's question that he always asks,

221
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,220
how can we make money from this? Well,

222
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,100
it's not necessarily how do you make money from this?

223
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,080
It's how do you understand the trade you have on, right? At the end of the day,

224
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,640
sometimes we're going to have really bad ideas.

225
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,920
Sometimes we're going to have really good ideas,

226
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,480
but if we can't manage these positions,

227
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,520
if we don't understand the risk we have on or what we expect,

228
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,260
we think is going to happen and we can't make money.

229
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,120
If what we were able to do here was put on a trade that better expresses our view,

230
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,400
right? We knew that, you know, we could take off, you know,

231
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,240
we would be in a better spot structuring it this way because of that correlation,

232
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,800
it added another piece to the puzzle of our analysis.

233
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:20,570
If you're bearish on lit, right? If you think lit is going to trade down to 60,

234
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,130
right? You know, you sure you could take a short Delta bet,

235
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,320
but you could also sell vol, right?

236
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
And those are going to express a very similar view.

237
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,220
So blessing saying, you know,

238
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,700
is this what Wechsler from Maple Leaf Capital means when he says most option traders

239
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,000
are vol traders by default? So every option trader is a vol trader.

240
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,960
They are taking a direction on vol, right?

241
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,160
Think about it like this with a stock, you can say,

242
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,220
I'm going to buy Coca-Cola and hold until I'm profitable, right?

243
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,880
I'm going to buy Coke and I'm going to be a Warren Buffett and hold until I'm profitable.

244
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,080
But with an option trader, you are saying,

245
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,040
I'm going to buy this and something's got to happen by this date.

246
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,530
And so you are explicitly trading volatility, right?

247
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,230
You are adding that volatility component. Yeah. You have this,

248
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,710
how much component, right? Volatility is the size of these moves,

249
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,140
the how much is the volatility part, right? And then a lot of traders,

250
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,180
they don't know that they're trading volatility.

251
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,800
But what Michael Wechsler is saying is that you are a volatility trader,

252
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,940
even if you don't know it.

253
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,210
Exactly. Right. It's like, you know,

254
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,430
it's like some people know they're playing the game and people don't know they're

255
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,150
playing the game, but everybody's playing the game.

256
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,510
So Stan saying,

257
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,670
what if the IV and spot correlation changes after we put on the trade,

258
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,950
you know, so it goes from being correlated to uncorrelated. In that instance,

259
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,730
do we quit the trade because our premise is no longer valid?

260
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,930
So it's not your primary premise, right? It's not like the, you know,

261
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,650
that's not your main, your main trade is not the correlation there.

262
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,720
Do you have any trades that you do where that is the core? That is the premise?

263
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,640
Well, not, not necessarily. Like I always have a view on vol itself,

264
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,200
but we can say, for example, if I think let is going to trade down, right.

265
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
And it's going to trade, let's say, trade down slowly. I can just short vol.

266
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,920
Right. Of course I can short Delta, but maybe,

267
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,160
maybe I'm taking on too much risk, right? Yeah. I'm doing that. So in this,

268
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,040
we're basically saying like,

269
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,240
we're minimizing the impact of us being wrong on that by taking advantage of this

270
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,960
correlation. Right. But, but then if the correlations, let's say like,

271
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,240
you know, tomorrow lit goes down 2% and vols go up a point. Yeah.

272
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,440
We're not going to be freaking out. No, we wouldn't be freaking out.

273
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,220
Because that's not really like our, that is not our trade.

274
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,620
It's just a piece of the puzzle that we took into consideration when structuring

275
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:58,400
it. But the strategy or the idea doesn't fall apart in that situation.

276
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,220
But if let's say traded down 5% tomorrow and vols picked up,

277
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,370
now we're probably in a tricky spot here.

278
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,210
We'd probably exit the position because on a rally vols might increase and on a

279
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,330
future down move vols might increase.

280
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,490
We might actually flip this position and maybe, you know,

281
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,980
pick up some long vol. Hey Swati, good to see you.

282
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,940
Swati has a question here for us.

283
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,700
Isn't IV and spot correlation related to gamma?

284
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,120
Like negative gamma is buying dips,

285
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,740
selling reps and positive gamma is the opposite.

286
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,700
So IV and spot will be correlated, you know, on the basis of gamma. Okay.

287
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,530
So Swati, so a negative gamma,

288
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:48,230
so short gamma is you're actually selling the dips and you are buying the reps,

289
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,110
right? Because if you think about it,

290
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,090
so let me just put it up here to show you.

291
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:02,110
So let's say we put on a position here where we are short gamma.

292
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,490
Okay. So here we're short gamma.

293
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,270
We can see that right here through our risk profile,

294
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,000
we're short negative 28 gamma. Now when the stock rallies, okay,

295
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,680
when the stock rallies, we need to buy shares, right?

296
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,160
In order to hedge our position, right? Otherwise we're just going to keep,

297
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,900
we're just going to keep losing money, keep losing money. So we need to buy,

298
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,080
we need to buy shares. And if it, if it drops, right, if the stock drops, well,

299
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,020
we need to start selling shares.

300
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,740
Otherwise we're just going to keep losing money, right? If we buy these dips,

301
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,520
then we're getting extra Delta and we don't want that.

302
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:53,560
So when we were short gamma, we are selling the dips and buying the,

303
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,540
buying the reps and a long gamma is vice versa is, is, is on the flip side,

304
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:09,300
right? And we can see that right in the stock rallies,

305
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:16,630
we want to get short and when the stock pushes, we want to when the stock dips,

306
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,110
we want to, we want to get long.

307
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,160
So and then the second,

308
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:31,330
the follow-up part was to that was so Ivy and spot will be correlated conditioned

309
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,430
on gamma.

310
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:44,760
So Ivy and spot will be correlated, conditioned on gamma. You know what Swati?

311
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,760
I honestly, I'm not too sure what you are saying here,

312
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,400
to be honest, I'm not 100% sure about the question.

313
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,420
Yeah. I, I'm not 100% sure what you're saying here.

314
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Maybe if you want to maybe ask it in a different way or,

315
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,620
or maybe clarify it a little bit, then I'd love to,

316
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,260
I'd love to ask for the lesson. Do we have anything else you want to add here?

317
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,080
Not really. Just be aware of it, right?

318
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,800
Be aware of the the implied correlation and spot correlation, right?

319
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:26,840
Be aware that if you're buying stock, you are basically short the VIX, right?

320
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,160
So just always be aware of that during the position and what you think will happen

321
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,620
to the stock.

322
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,760
If you're super bullish on the stock and it's correlated with vols, you know,

323
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,180
maybe it's not a good, maybe it doesn't really make sense to short volatility.

324
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,960
Okay. So just be aware of that. It's very cool.

325
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,130
So do we have any more questions for now? If not,

326
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,930
that will be the conclusion of the live.

327
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,010
So Swati says, I was trying to say, uh, it's maybe positive E,

328
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,680
positive EV gamma will be IV and spot correlated or no, uh,

329
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,480
it's maybe it'll be, uh,

330
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,340
uh, Swati, are you big on Twitter? I feel like I saw someone post,

331
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,340
so is this plus Vega gamma? I saw someone post VE one time as,

332
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,900
as Vega on Twitter. Okay. So I was trying to say, uh, is my, uh,

333
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:34,590
I was trying to say, it may be plus Vega, positive Vega,

334
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,430
positive gamma will be IV and spot correlated. Maybe I'm getting it wrong.

335
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,990
You know what Swati? Let's, um, send me,

336
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,050
send me a message after this or chat in the group. Yeah.

337
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,690
Let's talk about it in the trainers chat. Yeah.

338
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,650
I'm a little confused on the question you're asking here. Uh,

339
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,020
so sensing is implied volatility of an individual stock correlated to the VXX somehow

340
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,580
every stock, uh, has different IV in respect to their sector, right?

341
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,580
So every stock is going to have a different implied volatility,

342
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,120
not based on their sector, but based on a lot of things, right?

343
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,700
Their fundament, uh, their, their fundamental value, right? If a stock,

344
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,040
it only has cash on their balance on their, on their book,

345
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,780
it doesn't make sense for it to have a lot of volatility, right?

346
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,440
If you are a startup growth company,

347
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,400
it will make sense for you to have a lot of, a lot of volatility.

348
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,100
Then there's other things like, uh, if, if this, if stock X,

349
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,220
let's say Facebook is super correlated to, uh, the NASDAQ, well,

350
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,420
if it gets out of line with the NASDAQ,

351
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,260
arbitrage are going to come in and try to collapse that spread.

352
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,500
So there's a lot of factors that are going to play into, uh, the,

353
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,630
what is the fair value of this implied volatility, uh, of this asset. Um,

354
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,030
and I feel like we've done, we've made like hundreds of hundreds of videos, uh,

355
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,970
about that stuff, maybe like one, one piece at a time.

356
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,710
So if you just keep chugging away there, you'll definitely, uh,

357
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,970
you'll definitely pick up on all that. Stan,

358
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,180
as you work your way through that archive of 200 hours of content, it'll, uh,

359
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,740
it'll be there for you. And then, but Stan,

360
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,140
make sure you go through the bronze first, it's important. And then, so one,

361
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,080
one last thing, uh,

362
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,220
Stan saying is implied volatility of individual stock correlated to the VIX somehow.

363
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,530
So usually they're going to be negatively correlated and that's for the VIX is,

364
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,150
is the vol on the S&P. Okay. VIX is the vol on the S&P 500.

365
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,300
And usually stocks are correlated with the S&P 500, right?

366
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,920
Facebook is definitely correlated with the S&P 500. So,

367
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:38,660
and S&P 500 is negatively correlated with the VIX. So if S&P drops, uh,

368
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,560
vols go up. So usually you're going to see if the stock goes down,

369
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,940
the vols increase, look at Twitter, look at Baba.

370
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,670
Sometimes you're going to have these mean stocks,

371
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,380
these other stocks that when the stock rallies, implied vol picks up.

372
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,980
Even with those, like you, you wouldn't be, uh,

373
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,610
so I think an important thing to talk about is, you know,

374
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,470
let's say we're looking at Tesla, right? In a market crash,

375
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,380
Tesla vols would probably still go up, right? For these massive moves, right?

376
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,360
Let's say the stock drops 30%. Yes. Vols are still going to go up.

377
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,860
So you wouldn't, you wouldn't be using Tesla as a hedge, right? Right.

378
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,880
So super important thing, I guess,

379
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,380
last thing we should talk about on that is we are talking about the more or less

380
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,140
the non-event volatility of it, right? The regular volatility of it.

381
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,980
But if you have a huge catalyst that drops the market, you know, or, uh,

382
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,600
you know, a huge earnings blunder that caused the stock to drop 20%,

383
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,280
you should still, you know, it's,

384
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,640
it's highly likely you will see vols go through the roof still, right?

385
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,290
Super important point, right? You would not be, um, you know, would it be, uh,

386
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,170
you know,

387
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,860
buying vol on a Tesla or selling vol on Tesla as a hedge for a market crash?

388
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,440
Yeah. You would never do that. Yeah. Um, and you know,

389
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,480
Sean just gave me a good idea here to draw it out here. Uh, there's, it's,

390
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,520
it's, it's, it's path dependency. Okay. So you have this, let's say meme stock.

391
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,740
Okay. It's trading like this.

392
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,040
Now, wherever the implied, wherever the realized vol is going to increase,

393
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,500
okay, is where we're going to see, uh, the spot correlation, right?

394
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,960
So let's say this is the S and P 500. If the S and P 500 moves down,

395
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,820
we should see it move down with more volatility, right? Stocks go up like a,

396
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,990
uh, escalator down like an elevator. Now if we,

397
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,250
if this was Tesla and let's say this is Tesla at 800, okay.

398
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:39,880
If Tesla were to trade at 900 in let's say a month, where would volatility be?

399
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:47,410
If Tesla were to trade at 700 in a month, where would volatility be?

400
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:53,390
And what we should see, right, especially with these, these, uh, meme, these,

401
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:59,890
uh, you know, uh, wild stocks like, uh, GME is that if it were to trade to 900,

402
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,350
it would go there with pace.

403
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,310
The volatility along this path would be extremely high. Okay.

404
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,630
So options are path dependent and maybe we'll do a live on that down the road.

405
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,270
We did a lot. We talked about that in our, uh, one about,

406
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,450
we didn't talk about it like thoroughly, but in the one about, uh,

407
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,170
the event ball messing with the price of the option. Oh yeah. No,

408
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,030
we were like a whole bunch of slow ball days, one high ball day,

409
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,650
the option sees all of it. We, we, we drew out the decision tree. Right, right.

410
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,910
We started. Yeah. Yeah. I think we can go a little deeper. For sure. Um,

411
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,590
so if it goes to 900, the vol is going to be extremely high,

412
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,630
but if it goes to 700, maybe the vol is very low to 700,

413
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:51,550
but if it trades to 600, okay, vols get high.

414
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,210
So you need to think about that path dependency, right?

415
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,030
And that's basically what the implied vol spot correlation is.

416
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,770
The market saying, cause the market is what's implied, right?

417
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,800
It's the market's view. If the stock goes up, implied vols and go up,

418
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,310
the stock goes down a little bit. The implied vol will drop,

419
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,550
but if the stock goes down quite a bit,

420
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,430
implied vols are going to increase again.

421
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,190
And that's what Sean was saying about the Tesla.

422
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,040
And we just hadn't mentioned that. So super important. Yeah.

423
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,880
Yeah. Mark, exactly. Right. So Mark saying, uh, you know, you would want to,

424
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,980
you know, during a, to hedge a market crash, you'd want to be long VIX,

425
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,860
not long equities, unless it was an inverse ETF or something similar. Yeah,

426
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,420
exactly. Mark. The, the, the main thing that I, are you using this? Yep. Yeah.

427
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,520
No, no, no. Right. Yeah. Mark. The, uh,

428
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,480
the main thing I was just pointing out there was just because you see Tesla has,

429
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,560
uh, you know, when, when Tesla goes up, implied vols go up, you know,

430
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,600
you wouldn't be, uh, you know, selling vol on Tesla as a hedge for the market.

431
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,660
Even though, you know, when Tesla goes down,

432
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,550
we see vol come down because that's not taking into account,

433
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,210
like a massive move down or a massive move down would still drive the vol up on

434
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,950
Tesla, even though it has that positive correlation.

435
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,990
And so blessing saying, so the more uncertainty there is,

436
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,810
the higher the chance of non-correlation.

437
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,430
It's not really about the uncertainty blessing. It's just basically about, um,

438
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,410
where the stock is going to see the volatility.

439
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,290
Is it going to see the volatility to the upside?

440
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,370
Is it going to see the volatility to the downside?

441
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,620
Whereas where's the volatility coming from? Right. So for example,

442
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,900
if we look at Tesla, we see 6% moves up,

443
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,620
3% moves down on the S and P we see 1% moves up, 4% moves down. Right.

444
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,400
So where, where is the volatility likely to be?

445
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,440
And that's going to cause that implied, uh,

446
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,940
realized correlation or implied spot correlation. Yeah. Mark,

447
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,380
I was basically just saying that, you know, an, uh, an equity like, um,

448
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,840
Tesla has a positive correlation between implied volatility and a price.

449
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,360
So when the price goes up, we see the implied vol go up for Tesla.

450
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,960
When the price comes down, we see the implied vol come down.

451
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,460
Now for the whole live, we talked about that, uh, just as, as a statement.

452
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,420
And I was just clarifying that with this,

453
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,100
this is not saying that you could be using Tesla vol as a hedge against a market

454
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,560
crash because if test,

455
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,140
okay, sorry. Yeah. Just to clear that, that if the market goes down,

456
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,260
they're all going down together. Okay. And the vols will go up for all of them.

457
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,890
Okay. Yeah. Sorry. It wasn't clear there. Yeah. One last thing there. Yeah.

458
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,730
So Swati's asking,

459
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,750
is it always better to buy deep in the money leaps instead of equity because it's

460
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,450
protected? So the answer is, is, um, there's never any, there's never a better,

461
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,290
right? That's the, that's the one thing. There's never a better, um,

462
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,020
every tool uses is used for a certain situation. Buying an in the money leap,

463
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,170
you're still going to pay some type of extrinsic value, right?

464
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,650
Some type of premium. And so for that reason,

465
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,710
if implied volatilities are too expensive,

466
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,390
you're going to be paying too much for that, even though it's a little bit,

467
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,190
right? That being said, if let's say the stock were to come down like crazy,

468
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,310
sure. The implied volatility will pick up, right.

469
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,990
And offset some of your losses, but your Delta is one for those options, right?

470
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,070
Assuming it's really, really far in the end of money, let's say it's like 0.9,

471
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,230
right? So you're going to have such a big loss on Delta. You're offset from,

472
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,910
um, you know, you're offset from a little bit of a Vega hedge.

473
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,480
It's not really going to, um, it's not really going to cut it. So there's debt.

474
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,960
I wouldn't say it's definitely better. Also,

475
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,240
there's bigger transaction costs out there, right? Um, I would say if you,

476
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,070
if you want to be long to start or long Delta, nothing wrong with buying stock.

477
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,610
All right. Okay. So here we go. So that's it. Awesome. Great questions.

478
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,610
I really appreciated the really good questions tonight, everyone, um,

479
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,330
makes the lives a lot more fun. And, uh, I think for everyone watching,

480
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,270
there's so much more value when we have these, uh, questions come in.

481
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:15,320
So let's keep it up. Thanks guys. And, uh, tomorrow poker night, Mark, Mark,

482
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,840
you better be there, man. No excuses, buddy. Eric. You too.

483
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,940
What's Mark saying? Stan. You got to be there too, man. Oh, Hannah.

484
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,600
Don't forget to be there. Okay. We know you're going to be there.

485
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:33,120
What do you mean? Stan, you've got, you literally have 23 hours to learn. Okay.

486
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,880
Guys, go figure it out. Mark. No response. Yeah. I know. Right. Mark.

487
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,320
What's going on? If you go into the archive,

488
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,680
there's actually a few videos on poker strategy there. He's still Mark.

489
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,680
We need to see you out there tomorrow, buddy. Come on, Mark. There he is.

490
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,310
How old is Mark? If we, Sean and I are going to make a post,

491
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,950
if we get more than 15 likes on it, you got to come out. You have to come.

492
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,790
How about that? Even if it's for an hour.

493
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,740
Yeah. So if you want to learn a little bit about poker,

494
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,200
go online and learn the basics.

495
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,400
And then you can learn a little bit about poker strategy.

496
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,120
If you go into the live archive, we have two or three videos on poker strategy.

497
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,300
Yeah. We're going to be playing on PokerStars.

498
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:27,400
We have a homeroom that we play in and then Sean and I give out $25 to the winners.

499
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,800
Except we never lose. Except, yeah, Mark, we don't lose.

500
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,980
Hutch is probably fuming right now. Or Hannah, sorry, not Hutch.

501
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,940
Hutch is not here today.

502
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,400
So yeah, we definitely, we need some competition out there. Okay, everyone.

503
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,780
We will see you tomorrow for poker night and to chat during the day.

504
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,680
We're going to be doing a whole bunch of market analysis tomorrow,

505
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,180
so we'll see you in the chat. Yep. See you guys. Andres,

506
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,460
I see you sneaking in late, man. Hey, buddy.

507
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,730
All right. See ya. Bye.
