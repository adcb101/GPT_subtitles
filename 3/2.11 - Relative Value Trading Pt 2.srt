1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,430
A couple of new faces here, you know, it's always nice, it's always nice,

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,250
you know, seeing new faces, right? It means community is growing, it means,

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,750
you know, it's getting more and more exciting for the group, right?

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,670
People are really starting to collab, and we're noticing it in the live,

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,380
in the chats now. So very exciting to see. Jared, actually, quick comment,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,760
if you want to leave it down there, did you exit the BYND position?

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,520
And let us know how that went.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,850
So guys, yesterday, in yesterday's live, we talked about relative value,

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,730
we talked about it means to do a relative value trade, to do a pairs trade,

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,070
and why we do relative value, right? It was just a general talk about it.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,520
But in today's live, we're going to talk about,

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,000
we're going to actually go in actual examples that people and professional traders

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,400
have used to try and make money. Okay,

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,240
and now there's so many examples of relative value.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,360
But just from recent memory, I decided to choose a few, you know,

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,490
for explanation purposes and for, you know, to get general discussion going.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,020
So let me, so let me share my screen.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,860
Okay, guys. So remember, relative value, oh, look at that, the guys,

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,100
the guys are, the guys are all, three notifications. We're almost there. Okay.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,280
So guys, remember,

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,120
the whole point of relative value is to be able to trade one asset versus another

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,580
asset, right? A lot of the time, we can't get enough leverage, right,

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,760
by just trading one asset. If we think something is expensive, right?

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,220
So let's say we think S&P volatility is expensive. Well,

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,940
we can't get a lot of leverage by selling vol, right? Or if we think, you know,

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,300
S&P is cheap, we still can't get a lot of leverage, you know,

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,940
buying vol because at the same time, if we're wrong, we could lose a lot.

28
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,680
So what relative value does, or pairs trading,

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,380
is it tries to minimize that risk so we can get better exposure, right?

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,580
And it also allows us to take a view on relationships rather than just in absolute

31
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,350
terms. Okay.

32
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,960
So this is a recent example that I found online that I thought we would chat about.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
So for those of you that don't know,

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,140
Chris is a portfolio manager over at Ambrose Group. He just recently started,

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
recently started there after leaving BMO.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,080
So I'm just going to go through the tweets so you guys can really get a sense of

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,360
what's going on here. Okay. So historically,

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,560
XLU and XLPI vols don't trade too far off from each other.

39
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,690
But I'm surprised XLU is only trading three vols higher based on the allocation

40
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,210
breakdown. The quality of the holdings between the two are night and day. Okay.

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,010
So, so let's, let's break this down here.

42
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,260
So he's saying the utilities ETF and the XLP,

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,200
which is the consumer discretionary or the consumer staples ETF. Okay.

44
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,410
So utilities and consumer staples ETF are only trading three implied vols apart.

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,840
Okay. So what does that mean? Well,

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:20,950
it means that both options of XLP and XLU roughly estimate the same volatility in

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,710
the future, the same realized volatility.

48
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,930
So XLP options think that the volatility of XLP is going to be very similar to the

49
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,780
volatility of XLU. And what Chris is saying is, well, I opened up these ETFs.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,460
Okay. I opened up to see what is actually inside of them.

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,820
And what he found was, okay. In XLP, you have stocks like Procter and Gamble,

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,360
Walmart, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, right. Philip Morris, Colgate,

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,600
you have all these like big, well-established companies, right. The, you know,

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,160
probably not going to have a lot of volatility. Okay. And then on the XLU side,

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,320
you have these utilities, which, you know, I guess Chris is saying they don't,

56
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,200
they don't really have they're, they're not really that, you know, that stable.

57
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,040
So he's saying, well, given that, you know,

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,290
XLU is a lot more unstable than XLP, why should the vols be the same?

59
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,990
So what he's doing is, well, maybe he's going to say,

60
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:37,680
let me go and buy some vol on XLU and sell some vol on XLP. Okay.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,920
And as long as XLU vol is more expensive or realizes more than XLP,

62
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,260
we're going to make money on this trade. So the way he would structure this,

63
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,090
let me share my screen. You're sharing your screen. Oh, sorry.

64
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,430
Let me share a new screen. Whiteboard? Yeah. You can just do this. Oh,

65
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,330
there it is. I didn't see it there.

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,760
So what he's saying is, well, let me go and sell a straddle. Okay. On XLP.

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:16,670
And let me go and buy a straddle on XLU.

68
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:27,460
Okay. And what he's saying here is, as long as XLU does something like this,

69
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,050
and XLP only does something like this, we're going to make money.

70
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,250
And the reason this is the case is again, guys,

71
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,970
he's saying that XLU has worse holdings than XLP.

72
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,370
Meaning that the volatility on XLU realized should be higher than the volatility

73
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,430
on XLP realized, even though they're trading at similar implied volatilities.

74
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,710
Right. Now,

75
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,820
we're not going to go into the details on why this may or may not be a good trade,

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,920
but what we're going to do is just continue down the thread because I think we have

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,440
some good banter going on.

78
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:18,220
Okay. So I think there was a, before we jump into my comment,

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,960
I think there was a really good post.

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,840
Okay. So actually it wasn't a really good post by this guy, but anyways,

81
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,300
I came in, I said a couple of things. So we're going to,

82
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,500
this is all relative value. Okay. So, so I'm just saying, you know,

83
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,180
a couple of things here.

84
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,380
It's much better to compare the ratio when doing index versus index for relative

85
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:50,020
value trades. Okay. So if index one moves 10%, we would expect index two,

86
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,570
if correlated to move by some ratio of that, right? Some beta. So here,

87
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,050
what I did was I plotted the historical implied volatilities.

88
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,280
I don't know why I didn't put the dates here,

89
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,900
but I plotted the historical implied volatilities where I took the two largest holdings.

90
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:15,990
Okay.

91
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,820
And what we see here, right,

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,160
is that the implied vols are actually really correlated.

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,120
They're really correlated and sorry, they're not really correlated, but they,

94
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,100
they move together and they're not usually far off, right?

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,090
They're usually in the same range, which is why, you know,

96
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,750
we're seeing if the two underlying components are the same implied vols,

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,420
then we should see that, you know,

98
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,340
the ETFs are going to have the same implied vols, right? That only makes sense.

99
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,200
So, but that's the implied vol. Let's take a look at the realized.

100
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:02,340
Okay. So with the realized vols, they also, they don't differ that much, right?

101
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,030
They're pretty similar. And in recent times, right, and this is where,

102
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,240
you know, maybe Chris could have made a trade here, right? In recent times,

103
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,620
they're starting to get wider. So it seems like NEE, right, in blue.

104
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,360
So this is what's actually happening.

105
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,640
The realized volatility is actually moving quite a bit relative to PG.

106
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,960
Now, what did I say here? So then I said,

107
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,940
I think the real question you're asking is why do the components of XLP and XLU

108
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,600
have similar eyeballs,

109
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,780
given that the components of XLP are much better quality than the components of

110
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,960
XLU, right? So what we're saying is it's not, we're not,

111
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,320
we shouldn't be really looking at the eyeballs here alone, right?

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,420
We need to be able to compare that with, let's say the realized vols.

113
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,060
What's actually happening? What has actually happened, right?

114
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,920
Is it likely that the quality of PG has changed so much in the last month relative

115
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,660
to NEE? I'm not too sure. But what we can do is we can say, well,

116
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,340
PG probably doesn't change that much. Let's see how much,

117
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,700
let's see how it's done, you know, the last year or last two years,

118
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,960
last five years relative to NEE, right?

119
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,380
Do you think a utility changes that frequently? Probably not, right?

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,750
It's unlikely for the spread to just randomly break down. Okay. We need,

121
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:41,460
there needs to be some other reason for it. So if Chris was more like, okay,

122
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,600
given NEE has all this fundamental stuff coming out, right, and XL, XL,

123
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,170
what was it? PG has all this like, this other, you know, it's super stable,

124
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,500
then maybe there's a trade there, right? But we need, we need to really,

125
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,620
when we go into these relative value trades,

126
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,080
we really need to understand what's going on, right?

127
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,160
What has the relationship been historically and what,

128
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,320
and if it were to break down, what would be the reason for it?

129
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Okay. Okay. And this guy, Chris is basically asking the same thing. It's like,

130
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,380
how,

131
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,070
how are the components moving, right?

132
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,960
How are the components moving inside this, inside these ETFs? Okay.

133
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,820
So that was one example. Do you guys have any questions about that example?

134
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,700
Yeah. So yeah, yeah. That's Moonwater, Chris. He's really good.

135
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,660
So let me just see.

136
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,820
Yeah. Steven, we could have a hundred percent done that. The only issue is.

137
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,720
For the live, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,440
Questions even asked is why don't we just look at the realized vols of the ETF?

139
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,820
Yeah. And that's a, that's a really good point. Steve.

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,550
The issue we would have is, is that the underlyings change in that ETF, right?

141
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,360
The underlyings are constantly changing. And his point was that the,

142
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,380
that the equities in this ETF, you know, are not,

143
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,560
are lower quality or lower quality.

144
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,780
Okay. And then quote, quote, I'm actually saying not the quality,

145
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,220
but the performance under stress. I'm not too sure what you're,

146
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,480
what you mean by that. Maybe if you want to elaborate, we can,

147
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,600
we can get to that. Okay. So another example of a relative value.

148
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:52,620
Okay. So we're right now, guys, right up here, I have the VIX central.com,

149
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,340
which is basically the VIX futures curve. Okay. So for example,

150
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,380
we have the November VIX future. We have the December, January, February,

151
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,540
March, April. Now a relative value trade we could take here, for example,

152
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,510
which people were taking a lot before the election. Okay.

153
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,150
Was selling one expiration and buying another expiration.

154
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,340
So throwing on a calendar spread. Okay. So we're going to go and look at, okay,

155
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,630
we're going to go back to the election here.

156
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,600
Okay. Let me take a screenshot of this cause it's going to move.

157
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,700
Click on it. Yeah. Okay. So here you guys can see, right? Okay. So here is the,

158
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,820
the front month election vol.

159
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,470
And now the stance that a lot of people were taking were, okay,

160
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,460
the December contracts are way too expensive relative to these contracts out here.

161
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,980
Okay. So what they were doing was they were selling December and buying,

162
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,930
let's say March and what they,

163
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,350
what they were hoping for was once the election came out and was done,

164
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,240
you would see,

165
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,610
you would see these contracts drop. Okay.

166
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,820
Now they couldn't go out and just go and sell these naked, right? You know,

167
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
you could, I mean, we did, right.

168
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,710
But they want to take a more risk averse approach. This could blow up.

169
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,290
And if you're held, you're, if you're holding naked, you're in trouble.

170
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,960
So what they would do is they would sell these and buy these so that if this were

171
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,560
to go up, this would also go up, would also likely go up.

172
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,820
So even though they're losing money here, it would make money here.

173
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,860
Okay. So you can do this, for example, with calendar spreads in inequities,

174
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,720
right?

175
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:18,370
Let's say you think Apple 30 day implied volatility is too high relative to Apple

176
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,650
90 day implied volatility. Well, you could sell those and buy the 90 day,

177
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,880
right? You're selling gamma here and you're hedging with Vega, right?

178
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,340
And that's a little bit of a tricky concept,

179
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,340
but what it basically means is if the stock moves like crazy,

180
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,040
then the implied vol in the back, remember,

181
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,970
cause you got all Vega in the back is going to blow up.

182
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,050
So you're selling the gamma, but you're hedging with the Vega, right?

183
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,650
Let's think about that.

184
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,970
If you have something that's expiring soon and you get a big move,

185
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,470
it's heavily impacted, right? Cause there's not much time left.

186
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,040
But if you're getting massive moves now,

187
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,600
what's the market going to potentially imply about the future? Well,

188
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,220
it might imply that, you know, especially if you, if you position it, you know,

189
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,940
you're not, you're not selling two years out.

190
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,840
You're selling a couple of months down the road, right?

191
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,900
It could imply that this, this volatility will continue into the future.

192
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,320
Okay. So Mark was saying,

193
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,440
why don't you look at other components instead of big ones? So Mark was,

194
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,240
that's a really good question.

195
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,420
The reason why we look at the bigger components is because they make up the majority

196
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,940
of the ETF. Think about it like this. Okay.

197
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:43,760
We have one ETF that has 99% Apple and 1% Microsoft.

198
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,320
This whatever happens in Microsoft is not really going to impact the ETF.

199
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,940
Instead we want to focus on the things that make up the majority of the portfolio,

200
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,620
right? But in Mark's defense, the highest component was 16%. Yeah.

201
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,180
And it was a whole bunch that were like four and 5%. Yep.

202
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,120
So it's a really good point.

203
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,000
Mark was also a time component where we didn't have five hours to analyze that.

204
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Mark was, that's, that's in that case, that Mark was,

205
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,880
it's a really good point. You'd want to, let's say break up.

206
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,720
So this is called principal component analysis,

207
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
where we would basically take the ETF and find out, well,

208
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,720
what are the highest components that drive the volatility of this ETF, right?

209
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,520
And we would probably say, let's just take the top 75%.

210
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,890
Whatever makes up the top 75%, we're going to take those, right?

211
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,590
We don't want to, we don't, we can't worry about everything, right?

212
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,080
Imagine we were doing a trade where we were trading the component against the ETF.

213
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,120
Well, we don't, we don't have the infrastructure to trade,

214
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,060
let's say a hundred names,

215
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,710
but we might have the infrastructure to trade four or five names. Okay.

216
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,540
So Ray had a good question here. He said,

217
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,620
wouldn't you lose more on the front end than you make on the back end doing this

218
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:10,510
VIX trade? Yes. So if it were to come down, right, so Cody,

219
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,270
with this relative value trade,

220
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,560
this is a little bit different than let's say a calendar in the equity space,

221
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,640
because these are futures. These are not options.

222
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,560
So if the first month were to come down, right,

223
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,480
we would make money because we're selling that. And if it were to go,

224
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,360
if let's say this were to go up, we are hoping that this would come up as well.

225
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,960
Right. And we're hoping actually that this would come up even more than this.

226
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Right. So if this, let's say we remove two points, this would move 2.5 points.

227
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,560
And if this were to come down, right, this would come down,

228
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,680
let's say five points, but this would only come down, let's say two points.

229
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,760
Right. So,

230
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,230
but of course we would lose money if this went up five points and this only went

231
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,270
up three points. Right. So, you know, with every single trade,

232
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,930
we have to take a view, right? We have to say, okay,

233
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,360
this is what we think is going to happen. And if it doesn't happen,

234
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,080
we should expect to lose money. Right. I don't know.

235
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,440
I don't know of a situation. Yeah. Right.

236
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,360
The market's not going to give you a risk-free trade. Right. Yeah. I mean,

237
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,090
I don't think I can think of a situation where I want Y to happen and then X happens

238
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,050
and I make money. Right. Because then it was a bad trade. Yeah.

239
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,920
It was a bad trade because I wasn't expressing myself properly. Right.

240
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,420
And I was like, okay, if Y happened, maybe I lose money.

241
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,170
So right.

242
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,370
Okay. Yeah. So Mark was saying like,

243
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,870
but imagine like the 30% small ones all move crazy and the 16% big one doesn't move

244
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,560
30% so all the small ones have high volatility, let's say,

245
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,940
and the big one doesn't. Yep. Or maybe it's implying the other way.

246
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,560
And then the small ones all just go crazy. That's a really good point, Marco.

247
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,500
So as long as like you, there are, um, if, if a stock makes up,

248
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,740
let's say 2% of the portfolio or 1% of the portfolio,

249
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,440
and there's other stocks that make up 16 or 20%,

250
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,080
these ones will have to move in a huge amount,

251
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,450
even just to really come up on the radar. Right. Think about, uh,

252
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,490
think about this, Marco's stock has 20% is a 20% of the index.

253
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,910
And you have another stock that let's say is 2% of the index. Well,

254
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,350
this stock has to move 10 times as much as this stock to have the same impact.

255
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,380
Right. And when do you ever see, um, you know,

256
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,680
let's say this top stock has 30% vol. This,

257
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,980
this little tiny stock has to have 300% vol, right. To have the same impact.

258
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,310
So, you know, you could definitely, um, you know, you, you can definitely find,

259
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,350
you know, maybe a company that's 5% that moves it, let's say 30% a day, or no,

260
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,650
that's too much. Let's say 5% a day. Right. And use that in your,

261
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,910
in your analysis. Um, and that's a really good point.

262
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,210
That is a very good point.

263
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,970
Speaking of the underlying, so we want to talk about how, uh, uh,

264
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,830
high volatility in the underlying can still reflect low volatility in the, uh,

265
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,880
in the basket. High volatility in the underlying? Like if they all move.

266
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,640
Oh yeah. Yeah. So guys,

267
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,890
imagine a situation where we're going to show you something really cool right now.

268
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,370
We've talked about it a little bit in the past,

269
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,190
but I think you guys will like this. What the fuck is going on? One second.

270
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,650
Can I close this? Yeah.

271
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:46,540
Okay. Okay. So we got, um, um, we got stock one, we got ETF one. Okay. Okay.

272
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,280
And this has two stocks, Apple and Microsoft. Right.

273
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,980
And this is more dispersion trading guys. We'll,

274
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,100
we'll just touch on this briefly, but we're going to get back into, uh,

275
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,160
it's just cause it's kind of like, um, related to what, uh,

276
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,980
Chris was kind of getting towards. Right. Right. Right.

277
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,520
This would be like if Chris took it to another level.

278
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,910
Right. And actually that is what, um, that is what, uh,

279
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,700
this Chris is saying is like, right. It's like, well, sure. They might have,

280
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,720
um, so that, that, that, that's what this Chris is saying. It's like, sure.

281
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,620
They might be bad names, right? They might be shit quality,

282
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,370
but if they're not correlated, you know,

283
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,050
then the volatility should be low of the basket. Right. And so,

284
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,370
and we're going to talk about that right now.

285
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,260
Do you want me to draw it? Yeah, sure. Probably do.

286
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,470
What the hell is that? A little firetruck. Okay. So we have, you know, uh,

287
00:21:47,650 --> 00:22:00,030
ETF one and it has two components. Let's say it has Apple and it has Microsoft.

288
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,230
You want to explain it as I draw? Then we have ETF two. Okay.

289
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:14,990
So we have XLU and then we have XLP. Okay. So XLP has Apple, Microsoft.

290
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,690
Let's just say this has stock one and stock two.

291
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,890
And XLU has stock one and stock two.

292
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,040
Now imagine Apple and Microsoft are shit quality. Okay.

293
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:30,360
And the volatilities of Apple is 50% and the volatility of Microsoft is 50%.

294
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,920
They're shit. They're garbage companies.

295
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:43,070
And ETF two has volatility of stock one of 15%. Okay. Because it's, uh, it's,

296
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,870
it's a Walmart and stock two of 15% because it's a target. Okay.

297
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,720
Two really good companies. Now imagine an ETF one where Apple,

298
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,650
Microsoft have a negative correlation. Okay. Negative one correlated.

299
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,210
Okay. So if Apple goes up, Microsoft goes down. And an ETF two,

300
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,970
they have one correlation. Okay. Meaning if, if stock one goes up,

301
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,100
stock two goes up. Okay.

302
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,640
Imagine what happens tomorrow. Okay. So let's,

303
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,480
let's talk about what happens to these ETFs tomorrow. Apple moves up huge.

304
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,570
Okay. Apple moves up 5% tomorrow, but Microsoft has negative one correlation.

305
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,840
So it also moves down 5%. Okay. So Apple moves up 5%.

306
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Microsoft moves down negative 5%. The ETF doesn't move. Yeah.

307
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,180
Assuming these are equally weighted, right? So this is a 50%, right?

308
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,740
This is 50% of the basket. This is 50% of the basket.

309
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,680
What happens to the price of the ETF?

310
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,430
Well, the ETF would be like this, right?

311
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,150
So the question is, what's the vol here?

312
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,760
What's the vol of Microsoft?

313
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,590
And what's the vol ETF one, right?

314
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,860
Now ETF two, right? They have one correlation.

315
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,350
So stock A moves up 2% and stock B moves up 2%. Well,

316
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,700
what's going to happen to the, to the index? Well, it's going to move up 2%.

317
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,090
Right. So I'm sure these components, these, you know, these components are,

318
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,590
are, are of worse quality,

319
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:05,480
but because the correlation is a lot lower than the volatility of the basket is

320
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,720
going to be a lot lower. Oh, the correlation is higher here. Yeah.

321
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,560
Sorry for A1. So do you guys, does that make sense to you guys?

322
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,330
So let's say, okay, so here's a cool one.

323
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,650
So let's just wrap up what we see here. If the underlyings are correlated,

324
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,190
the ETF vol and movement will also be correlated with the underlyings.

325
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,750
Make sense?

326
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,990
So question for you, what, if we find an ETF like ETF one,

327
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,200
what's the opportunity? What's the trade? Is there a trade here?

328
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,590
Let's see who can answer this and explain why.

329
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,060
So what's the trade?

330
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,040
Exactly. Jekka.

331
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,840
Okay. So the answer is you guys are on the right track here. Yeah.

332
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,520
The answer is Jekka hit it right on the head is we buy Apple vol,

333
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,260
we buy Microsoft vol and we sell ETF vol,

334
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,470
right? We sell that vol.

335
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,490
Does that make sense? So let's see.

336
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,790
Let's just explain how that happens a little bit more.

337
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,700
And Steve, it actually can't be nothing. I'll explain to you afterwards.

338
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,980
It can't be nothing. Okay. We're going to get rid of some of that stuff.

339
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,860
So you want to explain that? How it can't be nothing? No, no. Why this works?

340
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,170
Oh yeah. Because you're selling, you know, the,

341
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:25,330
the ETF let's say has implied vol of let's say 20%, whatever it is, 30%.

342
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,890
You will be able to that, that you're basically going to get a no vol on that,

343
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,950
right? On that ETF.

344
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,560
So you can buy the components and you're going to get vol there, right?

345
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,700
If you're buying vol in the components,

346
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,380
you're going to get when the stock moves, you're gonna make money,

347
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,400
but you won't make money on the if you buy, if you sell the ETF,

348
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,100
you're going to make money because it's not going to move.

349
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,980
And what like, so, so obviously there's the component of this where it's like,

350
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
what's the market saying? Right. Right.

351
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,740
So what we're seeing here with the market is the market saying low vol on this and

352
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,500
high vol on this,

353
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,160
but why is there money to be made selling this if the market saying it's going to

354
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,800
be low vol or is the market pricing it differently than what we're looking at here?

355
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,380
So if there, so remember when we're, when we're looking at the formula for it,

356
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,620
uh,

357
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:20,670
it's square root, uh, weight or weight,

358
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:27,210
weight of asset one squared times the vol of asset one squared, right?

359
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:36,330
Plus the weight of asset two squared times the volatility of asset two squared,

360
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,090
right? And then we have this thing, Steve,

361
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,510
where it's the plus the correlation to the power of two,

362
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,950
not square or a square. Yeah. My bad. Totally fucked up.

363
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,910
I haven't done math in a while. Okay. Hold on.

364
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,830
I thought you were using the wrong symbol there. I think,

365
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,650
I think you and Jack are chatting too much. I know.

366
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,410
If I can turn you into Jack, man. Okay.

367
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,750
Look at this. I haven't done English. I can't even spell.

368
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,310
I think you're talking to Jack too much too, man.

369
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,650
So, uh, Steve, because it's, we have two components going into this, right?

370
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,910
We have this and we have a correlation factor. So even if this is zero, Steve,

371
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,280
we still have this. Does that make sense? So it's never going to be zero,

372
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,810
right? But then again, you're never going to find a,

373
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:38,170
maybe you can construct a position that is, you know, perfectly neutral, um,

374
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,240
and then be able to create a strategy around it.

375
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:51,710
Okay. Um, so that was just a quick briefing on, uh, correlation trading,

376
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,850
which we, we kind of got a little excited there, went off, uh,

377
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,820
went off track a little, but let's get back to it. Well, not,

378
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,160
not a hundred percent. It's, it falls into a similar, uh,

379
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,140
like train of thought, you know? Yeah. And actually it explains the, uh, the,

380
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,210
the Chris thing really well. Oh, sorry. Here. Yeah.

381
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,960
Let's do a new share. Let's get back to one more example.

382
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,720
Um, let's see which one's a good one.

383
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:30,450
Okay. This one was a good one. I like this one. Cause you roasted them. Yeah.

384
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,750
But we're not going to go into that. We're not going to go into that. Okay.

385
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,310
So let's take a look here. So, um,

386
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,980
and the only reason why you guys were using Chris here is because in recent memory,

387
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,640
um, He looks at this stuff. Yeah.

388
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,020
You don't have a lot of people that trade relative value. It's, it's a,

389
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,280
it's a very small market. So, you know, uh, this from recent memory,

390
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,380
this is what I could find. So let's chat about this. Chris is saying here,

391
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,080
bank earnings in a few weeks.

392
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,130
I'm a little surprised the market is trading cough left wing 10 volts higher than

393
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,650
WFC default on those sub 400 credit score approvals, question mark.

394
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:16,740
So what's he talking about? Well, what are you saying here is you guys,

395
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,580
you guys know the skew graph by now, right?

396
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,820
Here's here is the percent of the stock, right? So a hundred percent moneyness,

397
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,860
right? So let's say the stock's trading at a hundred. This would be the,

398
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,280
at the money strike, this would be the one Oh five strike.

399
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,540
And this would be the one 10 strike one, one 15 strike. This would be the 95,

400
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,790
the 90, the 85, right? So it's percentage of the stock. Well,

401
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,050
what do we notice here? Right?

402
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:45,220
So cough is in purple and what was the other one? WFC is in blue. Okay.

403
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,010
So what he's saying is, well, look at this. Okay. Look at the tail here.

404
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,470
It's so much more pricey than the WFC tail. Okay. The market's saying, well,

405
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,790
there's a greater chance of a massive down move in capital one,

406
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,970
which is cough or there's more risk of it. Yeah. It could be bad if it happens,

407
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,090
right? If the stock does, we talk about skew it where, you know,

408
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,790
when the stock does move down, right? It's going to move down more.

409
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,410
That's what the skew is saying here. Right? And that, you know,

410
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
there is a possibility.

411
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,130
The probability of a huge down move is larger here than there is here.

412
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,540
And his question is, well, why is this the case? Right? This,

413
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,970
this he's curious to know, right?

414
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,390
Banks come bank earnings coming up soon and he's trying to construct some type of

415
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,170
trade, some type of relative value trade here.

416
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,900
And so what he might do is he might say, okay, well, this is a little pricey,

417
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,920
right? This, this far left tail is a little pricey relative to Wells Fargo,

418
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,860
right? Maybe he has some analysis where in the same business model,

419
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,920
relative same size, et cetera, et cetera.

420
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,430
So he's going to come in here and start selling capital one ball deep out of the

421
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:07,040
money puts and buying Wells Fargo deep out of the money puts to hedge. Okay.

422
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,880
So that, that is an example of trading the tails, right?

423
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,920
Not at the money anymore,

424
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,080
but now we're taking advantage of the wide range of the,

425
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,840
of the vols in the tails, right? There's not really a big range here, right?

426
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,800
And the market saying, well, look what's happening out here or even up here,

427
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:43,000
right? So that is, that is an example of using relative value, relative value,

428
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,380
right?

429
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,900
You're looking at two similar assets that are being priced differently in the market.

430
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,760
You're asking why?

431
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,200
And then you're constructing a trade to take a view on this difference coming back

432
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,350
together. Yeah. Steve, it was funny. What do you,

433
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,270
what do you forgot to realize was that, so, okay, it was funny. I did.

434
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,920
Oh, I guess let, let, yeah, let's get that to clear. Oh yeah. Yeah.

435
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,980
What he forgot to realize was that cough had earnings vol,

436
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,600
had the event vol a lot sooner than a Wells Fargo, right?

437
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,820
Which is why we were seeing the bid up in the skew. But here's my reply to it.

438
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,810
Oh,

439
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,780
my bad, dude. That's okay. I thought we were moving to close it. My eyes,

440
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:33,100
my eyes. How do I go? How do I look at my tweets?

441
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,510
Profile maybe? Oh, there we go.

442
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,420
Okay, here, let's go. It's in replies. Oh yeah.

443
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,410
I was like, you guys should grab a coffee and talk it out. I know we should.

444
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,230
Right. Okay. Let's chat about this.

445
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,220
So,

446
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,670
so Chris saying, go look back at my tweets. Right. Okay.

447
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,630
We're not going to talk about what he's saying, but he's basically saying,

448
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,010
look, I was doing a relative value trade. I was buying up, you know,

449
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,590
the tails in, in a lot of these underlines, right? Because they were cheap.

450
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,470
Right.

451
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,030
But right before this, he came out and said,

452
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,030
I'm going to be buying vol on JP Morgan, right? Before the earnings event.

453
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,430
He didn't talk about any other vols, but he said,

454
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:41,270
I'm going to be buying vol on JP Morgan. Right. And it made sense. Why? Right.

455
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,160
Right. Let's go back to that. Before I show you guys mine,

456
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,520
let's go back to that. That's going to be too far gone, dude. Hold on.

457
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,040
We got it. We got it.

458
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:03,560
It's right here. Oh, you know what? Yeah. Okay. Okay. If you scroll up.

459
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,180
I don't think it's on this tweet. It's not. Oh, you know what? It's right here,

460
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,420
actually.

461
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,200
No, it's not. Oh, well. Oh, well.

462
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:23,950
Okay. Okay. So what I found was cough vol or JPM vol was extremely cheap,

463
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,170
right? So we can kind of understand why he was long JPM vol, right?

464
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,430
Why was he buying JPM vol?

465
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,990
And I'm sure a lot of you remember him coming out and saying, I was long vol.

466
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,110
I'm buying the tails on JPM, right? Before the earnings event.

467
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,790
And we could see exactly why this was the case.

468
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,610
Because before he made the tweet,

469
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:51,090
JPM vol on the tails was the lowest relative to all the other banks, right?

470
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,150
JPM is in white.

471
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,410
The out of the money puts were the lowest relative to every other bank he was looking

472
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:04,140
at. So it made sense for him to come in here and buy JPM vol, right?

473
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,400
Now does that, just because it's the cheapest, does that make it a good trade?

474
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,010
Right? And the answer is no, right?

475
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,090
There's a lot of more stuff has to go into it.

476
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,230
Maybe it's trading like that for a reason. And in this case, it actually was,

477
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:27,790
right? JPM barely moved. Every other bank moved, but JPM stayed flat, right?

478
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,150
And then eventually it spiked up, you know, just last week,

479
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,850
but this is way before then. Yeah. This is like a month ago.

480
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,490
So just because we see these like these spreads,

481
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,010
we have to really understand why these spread exist and that's where a lot of money

482
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,330
can be made because relative value trades,

483
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,670
they do exist and they exist quite frequently. Okay.

484
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,570
But understanding why it exists is the most important part because otherwise you're

485
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,010
gonna get burned.

486
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,150
And I've seen so many situations where it looks like it's a good trade,

487
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,940
but when you really dig down into it, you can get crushed.

488
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,090
Okay. So really take that in mind.

489
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,850
And guys also remember the reason why you can get crushed with these trades is because

490
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,110
you can pack on size, right? You have to pack on size.

491
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,140
You're only making a few points, right?

492
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,420
Because usually we're trading a relationship. So if this goes down,

493
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,280
this usually goes down together, but what we're hoping for,

494
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,400
we're just trying to get this,

495
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,410
right? So in order to make money here, we need to get more size on.

496
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,610
And so if you're wrong, right, and this is what they call,

497
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:39,210
they say getting fucked on both legs because it's gonna go like this, right?

498
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,270
So it didn't go like this or like this or like this,

499
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,290
but it went like this and now you're really screwed, right?

500
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,350
And that's the worst position to be in. And it happens. It happens, guys.

501
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,790
It's happened to me before. It happens.

502
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,920
Okay. So that's the live. If you guys have any questions,

503
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,080
we'll chat about it and then Sean and I are gonna grab some pizza. Yeah.
