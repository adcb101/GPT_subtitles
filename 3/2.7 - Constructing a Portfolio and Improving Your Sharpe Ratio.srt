1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,160
Yes. We'll see. Okay, guys. So in this, in this lab,

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,680
we're going to be talking about constructing a portfolio.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:20,100
And basically how we can improve ratio, meaning how we can improve our return,

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,140
our risk-adjusted returns. I know, right? Yeah.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,120
You guys, you have to deal with that thing. I'm not talking about Jordan.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm talking about this line. Sorry about that. It's coming back.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,000
Coming from the light up there. How we can improve our risk-adjusted returns,

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,700
which is our sharp ratio in a portfolio, right? So example,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,740
let's say you want to,

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,840
let's say you want to build your long-term portfolio or you want to build a portfolio

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,800
that wants to outperform the market. Well,

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,960
you maybe can do better by not just buying equity, let's say S&P,

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,520
but maybe by buying S&P and bonds and leveraging that. Okay? Because usually,

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,020
you know, when S&P goes down, you know, bonds are usually going down as well,

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,880
right? So that's kind of offsetting your loss.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,040
So therefore you can get leverage. And we're gonna talk all about that today.

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,280
We're gonna show examples. We're actually gonna build out a portfolio,

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,500
optimize it. You guys are gonna be able to see the weights through time.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,100
It's gonna be very, very cool. I already have the back test already built in.

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,900
And thanks to Pulumi, he was helping me with this.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,790
And the assets are chosen by Steven. So we're gonna go through this one by one.

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,530
But first, we're basically gonna start off very simple. Okay? So,

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,610
first thing we need to know. Is- Yeah, I'll figure it out. Okay.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,910
So the first thing we have to understand, guys,

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,610
and so this is gonna be a longer line. This is gonna be probably a full hour.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,640
But it's gonna be very informative. And you guys are,

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,680
I think you guys are gonna get a lot of value out of this one. So,

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,860
first thing we need to think about is our Sharpe ratio. Okay?

29
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,590
Sharpe, and I'm sure we've all heard this before. Oh,

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,110
I guess it's kind of hard. I think it's better on their end. Yeah. Okay,

31
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,990
that's good. Okay, so we got first thing about our Sharpe ratio.

32
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:14,190
And what our Sharpe ratio basically is, is our return. Okay? Yeah.

33
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,750
Maybe you have to- It's fine, it's fine. Yeah. Let me know, guys,

34
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,890
is it good or not good? No, no, lens is perfectly clean. All right, it's good.

35
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,830
I think it's good. Okay,

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,800
so the Sharpe ratio is equal to our return over our risk. Okay?

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,720
Our return over our risk. So, let's say, for example,

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,680
like usually in the market, so the S&P, for example, has a Sharpe ratio of 0.5.

39
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,120
Okay? This is the long-term Sharpe ratio of the S&P 500. Okay?

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,400
So what this means is, for every dollar of risk, for every dollar of return,

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,100
okay? You are, or for every dollar of risk, you are getting 50 cents. Okay? So,

42
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,320
for example, your, and risk here, is calculated as our standard deviation,

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,420
our volatility. Okay? So, a quick example. Our volatility might be 30%,

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,460
and our return is 15%. Okay? So that would be a Sharpe of 0.5. Okay?

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,300
Let me just get an eraser.

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,980
So, let's do exactly what the S&P usually is, right? The S&P, on average,

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,340
returns 9% a year.

48
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:42,040
Okay? 9% a year. And the volatility, on average, over the last, let's say,

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,840
10 years, is about 18%. Okay? So, our return is 9%, our risk is 18%,

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,040
our volatility. And so, therefore, we have a Sharpe ratio of 0.5. Okay?

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,220
Now let's look at a different example. Okay, let's look at ACB during the boom.

52
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,750
Okay? So ACB, let's say the return was, let's call it 100%. Okay?

53
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,180
But our volatility, we're gonna use a theoretical example, and, you know,

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,720
this is probably not too far off, is 300%. Okay? So here's ACB Sharpe.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,640
Okay? We make 100%, but for every,

56
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,500
but we are basically getting a Sharpe of 0.3. Okay? 0.33.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,360
So what does this mean? Well, what this means is,

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,740
we can get more leverage here, we can buy more S&P. Okay?

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,210
Let's say we go 10 S&P, we go S&P times 10, or let's say times 20. Okay?

60
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:02,600
So we get the same risk profile, but now our returns are much higher. Okay?

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,680
So we can think of the Sharpe ratio is normalizing our returns by our risk.

62
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,510
So now we're all in the same playing field. Right? So if you say, for example,

63
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,590
you might look at a fund, and the fund is, returns 25%. And you say, well,

64
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,210
that's pretty good. But when you look at his risk, he's doing, let's say 50%.

65
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,690
Right? So his Sharpe is only 0.5. But there's another fund out there,

66
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,160
who's returning, let's say 15%, but his risk is only 0.5. Right?

67
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,460
So now he has a Sharpe of three. So a Sharpe,

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,020
greater than one, is considered very good. Okay? And the high frequency guys,

69
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,080
I've seen Sharpe up to 10.

70
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,540
Okay? I've seen a Sharpe up to 10.

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,070
Any questions so far about this? It looks good.

72
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,810
We'll answer questions at the end. Okay. Okay. So,

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,620
how can we improve our Sharpe ratio? So let's go about talking about that.

74
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,580
Let me start with, why do we really care about Sharpe? Okay.

75
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,820
So the reason we care about Sharpe, and it's not the best,

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,240
it's not the best metric, because for example,

77
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,250
do we really care about upside volatility? Do we really,

78
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,910
if our portfolio is going like this,

79
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,050
do we really care about this? Right? So Sharpe ratio actually considers,

80
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,570
the up volatility as well. So there's other metrics called,

81
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,140
let's say the Kalmar ratio. Okay. The Kalmar ratio,

82
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,940
which basically looks at, our return, over our, max drawdown.

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,840
Okay. Our return over our max drawdown.

84
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,480
And this is usually a better metric to use, but you know,

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,440
the standard in the industry, is usually the Sharpe ratio.

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,850
So we're going to be talking about that for now. All right.

87
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,630
And it's the most easy to understand. Return over volatility.

88
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,800
So super quick, but is the return only like 5%? Oh, I think, okay, sorry guys.

89
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,860
If you guys are having your own conversation right now, we're going to,

90
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,060
I'm going to get back to all those, those questions later. Yeah.

91
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,900
We'll save the Q and A for the end. Okay. So how can we, how can we,

92
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,600
how can we do better? Right? So imagine we have,

93
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,940
how can we improve our Sharpe ratio? Well, imagine we have stock one. Okay.

94
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,060
Imagine we have the S&P. Okay. SPY.

95
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:04,170
And SPY gives us a Sharpe of 0.5. Okay. S&P gives us a Sharpe of 0.5. Now,

96
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,260
this is good. This is not bad. Right? This is what usually most investors get.

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,250
And then after transaction costs, this usually drops down quite a bit.

98
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,830
So even though this is, this is okay. Right.

99
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,850
And we always try to improve on this, of course. And that's the alpha, right?

100
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,010
Outperforming this on a risk adjusted basis, it's your alpha there.

101
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,800
So what we can do is, we can actually add an asset. Okay. Let's say TLT.

102
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,540
Okay. That let's say also has a Sharpe of, let's say 0.5. Okay.

103
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,440
But these are not correlated.

104
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,830
Okay. We'll say correlation is zero.

105
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,980
Okay. So we have, SPI, TLT, each having a Sharpe of 0.5,

106
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,760
but correlation is equal to zero. And so what this means is,

107
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,510
our portfolio is going to look something like this. Okay.

108
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:17,810
So let's say this is SPI. Going to use, and here we have TLT.

109
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,870
Okay. So when S&P is going through a drawdown,

110
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:39,280
our return on TLT is usually going up. Okay. And so our portfolio return,

111
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,660
now looks something like this.

112
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,310
Okay. So we have reduced our volatility, but our return stays the same.

113
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,250
So return, stays the same. Okay. So it's constant.

114
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,880
Okay. We'll say, we'll say our trade was return. It stays the same,

115
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,060
but our volatility, oops,

116
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,350
declines. Okay. So return stays the same,

117
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,150
but our volatility of the portfolio drops.

118
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,750
So meaning our Sharpe ratio increases.

119
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,290
And so what does this mean? What this means is we can add leverage.

120
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,790
We can add leverage here to this portfolio now. Right?

121
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,150
To get the same amount of risk as the S&P. Our new portfolio,

122
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,850
we can add more leverage, meaning higher return.

123
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,070
So now we're on the same playing field for the volatility of the portfolio,

124
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,710
because when you add leverage, you get more volatility. Right. When we add,

125
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,090
right.

126
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,770
So you could add enough leverage to bring it up to the same volatility as the S

127
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,610
&P. Exactly. Right.

128
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,530
So now you have S&P level volatility with a greater return because you diversified

129
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,860
with uncorrelated assets. Exactly. So now we have a higher Sharpe ratio,

130
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,060
meaning we get more leverage, meaning we get a higher risk adjusted return.

131
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,940
Okay. Same risk, higher return. Yeah. Same risk, higher return.

132
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,360
So how can we go about doing this now? How can we really graph this out?

133
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,980
And this is what we're going to call the efficient frontier.

134
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,560
Okay.

135
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,120
So here we're going to have our return.

136
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,340
Okay. And here we're going to have our risk.

137
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,850
Now let me ask you guys a question. Where do you guys want to be on this graph?

138
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,100
Where do you guys want to be on this graph here?

139
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,220
Exactly. Top left net. We want to be right up here.

140
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,220
We want zero risk and a very high return. Now, unfortunately,

141
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,980
this is not usually the case, but what we call here is the efficient frontier.

142
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,620
Okay. Looks something like this.

143
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,670
So let me ask you guys a question. Give me some stuff that is risky.

144
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,990
Give me some risky stuff here. Give me some anything.

145
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,610
And we're going to plot this on the graph here. So I'll start this out.

146
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:45,380
S&P 500. Actually, maybe I'll start out like lottery tickets. Lottery tickets.

147
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,170
This is going to be, I guess this would be...

148
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,790
It'd probably be down here, wouldn't it? Like low minimal risk. Yeah,

149
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,500
but the return is negative though. So maybe it'd be down here, right? Yeah,

150
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,360
it'd be off the graph. It'd be off the graph.

151
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
So like something like lottery ticket would be down here.

152
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,320
Where would the ERP be? Yeah, it'd be down here. A VRP? ERP.

153
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,760
Equity risk premium? Yeah.

154
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,440
Equity risk premium would be somewhere like right around here.

155
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,020
And then where would the VRP be? All right, around, let's say,

156
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,980
we'll just do arbitrary number. Right,

157
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,000
and then VRP would be a little bit higher here.

158
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,220
So we're trying to draw that line actually right now.

159
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,690
So we have the ERP here. Let me just label it. Okay, so ERP.

160
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,760
And we have maybe the VRP, a little bit more risk, a little bit higher return.

161
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,740
It's right here. Good. We'll call it VRP. We have gambling down here.

162
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,700
Okay, what else? What else do you guys have? What else would be out here?

163
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,100
Let's grab some more stuff here. Crypto, crypto. High risk,

164
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,800
high return potentially, right? Right up here.

165
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,560
What else we got?

166
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,040
Tesla. Tesla. Whoa, okay. Risk, really high return up here.

167
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,660
But really high risk. This is like all the way over here.

168
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,800
I can't go off the screen, so we'll go up here.

169
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,100
What about selling far out money puts? Would that just be the VRP or no? Yeah,

170
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,700
yeah, that'd be- Close enough, right? Yeah, well,

171
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,600
yeah. Selling far out money puts. It would probably be like here. Yeah.

172
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,740
Because it'd be in line with the VRP, but with huge blow up risk. Well,

173
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,800
it depends if it's leverage, right? If it's no leverage,

174
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,740
it'd be like somewhere here. So this would be the cash secured puts. Yeah.

175
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,740
What else guys? We'll do one more.

176
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,840
ACB. Oh, okay. High risk, no return. Yeah, yeah. That's down here guys, yeah.

177
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:19,780
That's down there. Okay. So now we have all these different items graphed,

178
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,090
okay? Now we can actually create a portfolio where,

179
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,440
so let me see if I can explain this properly.

180
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,120
So we have all these different types of equity,

181
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,500
all these different types of trading strategies, methodologies, assets,

182
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,020
whatever it is, right? All up here. Maybe we should put one more on there,

183
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,060
like gold or something. Okay. So gold is usually lower risk. And like,

184
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,360
I would say it's under a ERP.

185
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,310
Okay. So now here is all our different, now we can have a thing with this guys.

186
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,890
We can have so many different combinations of portfolios. Right?

187
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,920
We could have one combination, let's say 99% ACB and then 0.1% of the rest.

188
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,940
And that would be right over here, right? So this is 99% ACB.

189
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,720
Okay. Then we can have another one. Oh wait, cash. Cash is a good one.

190
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,220
Cash is no return, no risk. Right? We can have one that say is 100% cash,

191
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:32,320
right? And, or let's say 50% cash and whoops. So this is cash. Sorry guys.

192
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,760
Okay. We can have one that's 50% cash and 50% SPY.

193
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,580
And we would lie right around here. So we would call this,

194
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,800
let's say portfolio two. Okay. So here's another portfolio.

195
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,070
Now the thing is guys, there is an optimal portfolio. And when we say optimal,

196
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,970
we mean we can create a portfolio with all of these and give us the best risk adjusted

197
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,830
return. Okay. And it's not just one portfolio, actually.

198
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,310
We can actually make multiple portfolios. And all those portfolios,

199
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,950
those optimized portfolios are going to fall along this line.

200
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,560
Okay.

201
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,350
So for example,

202
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,730
we're going to do a couple of examples here so you guys can understand.

203
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:39,940
One optimal portfolio might be VRP, 33% VRP, 33% equity risk premium,

204
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:48,960
33% gold and 10% Tesla. Okay. And that's going to lie right around here.

205
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:59,750
Okay. And by combining these, because they are not correlated perfectly,

206
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,870
we can increase our sharp ratio. Okay. So basically this line right here, guys,

207
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,010
has the same sharp across the board. Okay.

208
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,700
The same sharp ratio is across this line. Okay.

209
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,980
But it's just how much risk do you want? How much return do you want?

210
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,540
But you're indifferent if you're here versus here.

211
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:32,600
You're taking on the same unit of risk for the dollar return as this one. Okay.

212
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,140
So far, so good. I don't know if you guys have any questions. It's all good.

213
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,450
I'm going to end the chat. Right. So this is the, let's say this,

214
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,410
so we have all these assets here and this line is our best sharp ratio.

215
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,530
Let's say, I don't know, let's say given these assets,

216
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,830
we can create a portfolio that has a sharp ratio of one. Okay.

217
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,110
Given all these assets right now,

218
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,210
we have a sharp ratio that has a portfolio of one. Okay.

219
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,210
Now let me ask you guys this question.

220
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,830
What's going to be the weighting of gambling in any of these portfolios?

221
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,290
Probably very, very, very small, right? Most likely zero,

222
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,650
but it could have a very small weighting if it's negatively correlated to some of

223
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,280
these names. Okay. So we can make thousands of portfolios.

224
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,800
Some of them are going to lie here,

225
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,100
but the best ones are going to lie along this line. Okay.

226
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,040
And these are the portfolios we want to be in. Okay.

227
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,900
Now this doesn't have to be portfolios though. Right.

228
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,300
Or this doesn't have to be assets. These could be strategies. Right.

229
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,460
And this is how we think about in terms of portfolio management is, well,

230
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm a portfolio manager. Let's say I got a few traders under my belt.

231
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,180
Let's say I got Neil running earnings calendars.

232
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,180
I got Hutch running earnings vol. I got Steve B running some long vol.

233
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,760
We got R.E.A. running long vol. We got R.E.A. running long vol.

234
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,940
And so I allocate money to these traders and I'm allocating the money so that my

235
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,240
Sharpe ratio is going to be the highest in the total global book.

236
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,350
Okay. So far so good.

237
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:13,190
Okay. So now that we understand this, let's actually do an example. Okay.

238
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,770
Let's actually do an example that Pulumi and I worked on and Steve B gave us the

239
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,630
assets for. You guys, I hope this really makes sense to you guys.

240
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,310
Once you see this in real time in action, building a portfolio.

241
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,020
Let me share my screen and we're going to jump into it.

242
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,370
Okay.

243
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,800
So here's what we're going to do here, guys.

244
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,220
The first thing we're going to do is,

245
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,460
so what we did here is we basically made a portfolio. Okay.

246
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,400
We gathered some assets.

247
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,910
It's like we built some assets here and we gathered XLP, XLU,

248
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:26,270
GLD, SLV, USD CAD and USD Aussie. Okay. So we have five assets or sorry,

249
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,390
six assets. And we want to basically say, okay, well,

250
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,290
what is the best portfolio to make here? Given these assets we have,

251
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,810
what is the best portfolio to make? And how has the return been? If we've,

252
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:44,770
let's say consistently changed our view as the world moved forward. Okay.

253
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,990
And I know it's going to be a little bit of a tricky concept,

254
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,710
but we're going to dive into that. You guys are going to see the returns.

255
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,290
It's very, very interesting to see.

256
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,570
Okay. So here we go, guys. So first thing we do is we got the tickers.

257
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,530
Now we're going to build out the portfolio.

258
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,040
Okay. So here we go.

259
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,930
So what we're doing here, guys, first thing we're doing, we're going to,

260
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,110
we'll go through this step-by-step so you guys can see what's going on.

261
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,490
So first we're saying, we're going to do a long only portfolio first.

262
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,380
We're going to say the maximum of our portfolio,

263
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,580
we have to basically be 95% to 105% invested. So if we have a portfolio,

264
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,260
I'm going to need a marker. Yeah.

265
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,080
And an eraser. Yeah.

266
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,200
So if we had, if our portfolio is, let's say a hundred, a hundred that,

267
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,330
or let's say it's $10,000, or let's say we have 10K. Well,

268
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,910
at every given moment, we want to be,

269
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,970
we want to have 95% of our portfolio to a hundred percent,

270
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:22,070
105% of our portfolio invested. So that's 9.5K to 10.5K. Okay.

271
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,050
That's the first constraint.

272
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,670
So far so good.

273
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,880
Then our second constraint here is going to be that every single asset that we have

274
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,410
there has to have at least a minimum,

275
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,710
minimum weighting of 2% and a maximum weighting of 60%. So no portfolio,

276
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,250
so no asset in our portfolio can have less than 2% weighting.

277
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,590
So if we have 10K, we can't have a portfolio,

278
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,700
we can't have any asset that is less than 200. Okay.

279
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,100
We have to be invested by more than 200 bucks in each asset.

280
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,960
And we can't have an asset that is more than 60% of our portfolio.

281
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,030
So as a portfolio manager, I can't allocate 70% to Neil Gang. Okay.

282
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,370
It's too much. So 60% is the max I can allocate to Neil Gang.

283
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,010
And how'd you pick two in 60? Oh, just arbitrary number. Yeah. In real life,

284
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,770
we do some more, more complex. Yeah.

285
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,730
There'd be a way to actually optimize that. Yeah.

286
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,290
Okay. So here we go. So we got that now. So let's run those.

287
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:44,620
Okay. And now what we're going to optimize for is our Sharpe ratio. Our mean,

288
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,220
right? Our risk, our return over our risk.

289
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,380
Okay. And now this is a really cool part guys.

290
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,660
What this is going to do is it's going to create thousands of portfolios,

291
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,240
right? 1% ACB, 99% cash, 98% cash, 2% ACB.

292
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,540
It's going to create thousands of these portfolios and we're going to try to find

293
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,320
the best one.

294
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,330
Okay. So we're just going to take a second here, guys.

295
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,610
Bloomy, it was running a lot faster, man. What's going on here? Here we go.

296
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,270
So let's extract the weights. Okay. So you can see right now in our portfolio,

297
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:44,320
the optimal weight would be 17% invested in XLP, 2% in XLU, 14% in GLD,

298
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:53,510
2% in silver, 4% in USD CAD and 55% in USD Aussie dollar. Okay.

299
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,590
So you can see that right here, right? This is equal weight.

300
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,890
The yellow line is equal weight.

301
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,080
And you can see we're way overweight on USD Aussie dollar. Or USD CAD.

302
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,430
I know this is on USD CAD. So short CAD USD.

303
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,810
Okay. So now what we're going to do here, guys,

304
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,930
is we're going to do something really cool. Okay.

305
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,030
We'll do something really cool.

306
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,910
Yeah.

307
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,500
So what we're going to do is we're going to go back to 2007.

308
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,600
Okay. And what we're going to do is in 2008, okay.

309
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:50,010
We are going to look back on all the data from 2007 to 2008. Okay.

310
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,490
And we are going to say, what is the best portfolio?

311
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,730
Given these historical returns, what is the best portfolio? Okay.

312
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:08,980
And then from 2008 to 2009, we are going to hold that portfolio. Okay. So 2007,

313
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,540
2008, we're going to create the portfolio. In 2008 to 2009,

314
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,150
we're going to hold the portfolio. Okay. In 2009,

315
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,390
we're going to look back and say, okay, well, what was the data?

316
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,710
What was the best data here? Okay.

317
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,730
And we're going to make the new portfolio and then we're going to hold that again.

318
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,430
Okay. We're going to keep doing that all the way until today.

319
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,380
And actually guys, sorry, sorry, my apologies. We're actually doing,

320
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,880
we're actually rebalancing quarterly.

321
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,370
So right over here. Yeah, thanks man. Thanks dude.

322
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,690
Use the thick part of the line. Okay. So right over here, okay.

323
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,830
We're going to look back and say, what is the best portfolio?

324
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,040
We're going to look back 252 days, 252 business days.

325
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,520
And then we're going to move in time one quarter. And then the next quarter,

326
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,460
we're going to look back 252 days and we're going to rebuild the new portfolio and

327
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,200
hold that for another quarter. Okay. So we're going to rebalance quarterly.

328
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,280
So here we go. Okay.

329
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,600
So that's the training period and the rolling window and then the rebalance on the

330
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,220
quarters. So there's no look ahead bias.

331
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,070
And I think you guys are really going to like this next graph.

332
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,860
Let's give it a second to load.

333
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,280
All right.

334
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,870
Okay. Blue, what are you saying blue? What's going on? There's nothing wrong.

335
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,780
Oh, oh, thanks dude. Okay.

336
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,100
So right now we're going to chart the weights through time.

337
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,380
So you guys are really going to like this one. Okay.

338
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,700
It's going to be a new graph for a lot of you, but it's a very nice one.

339
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,990
Okay. Kind of cool. Kind of cool, right? So what's going on here? Well,

340
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,270
the purple area, right? So on the left axis, guys, we have our weights. Okay.

341
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,450
So for example, you can see in the beginning of the time, right?

342
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,070
Let me blow this up a little bit.

343
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,100
So you can see here in the beginning, we weren't usually,

344
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,360
we didn't have a lot of USDCAT exposure, right? But you can see as time grew,

345
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,120
we started adding more and more USDCAT, right? Imagine guys,

346
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,740
this is one period, okay? Each bar is one period of our portfolio.

347
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,620
Each section represents how much of our portfolio is in,

348
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,520
how much of that asset is in our portfolio. So you can see in this period,

349
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,710
the first period, right? We had a lot of XLP. And then in about four quarters,

350
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,070
we started to take out XLP and we started shifting into more USDCAT, right?

351
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:19,100
And this is how it changed over time. So very cool graph, right? Very,

352
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,940
very cool graph.

353
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,780
So let us keep going here.

354
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,240
Okay. So now what we're gonna do is we are going to graph this, right?

355
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,060
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna create the equal weight portfolio.

356
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,580
So if we didn't optimize. So what was this portfolio if we didn't optimize?

357
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,260
And then we're gonna say, well, what was our portfolio after optimization?

358
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,170
Okay, so pretty cool. Pretty cool. The black line is our strategy,

359
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,730
it's our new portfolio, okay?

360
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:58,680
And the red line is if we equal weighted each asset, okay? So you can see,

361
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,480
let me just plot the table annualized. You can see,

362
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:10,710
so we can get our Sharpe ratio. Okay, you can see we doubled our Sharpe ratio,

363
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,870
right? Right here, annualized Sharpe ratio. You guys can see that.

364
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,140
We almost doubled our Sharpe ratio, right?

365
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,120
Our adjusted return was about the same,

366
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,320
but our risk went down substantially from our optimizations.

367
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,850
Okay, so this now is, we're running a Sharpe of 4.2, and this is not bad,

368
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,590
right? This is not bad. Now,

369
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,880
what we could do, for example,

370
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,280
is if we wanted the same risk as the equal weight portfolio,

371
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,120
but we could increase this, we could, let's say, go two times our portfolio,

372
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,900
right? And we would increase our annualized return, right? So let's say 5%,

373
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,480
5.2%, and we would have our annualized entry deviation of 5%, or sorry, of 12%,

374
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,120
okay? So far, so good. So we're gonna introduce shorting.

375
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,320
Let me know what you guys are thinking.

376
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,940
Lumi, so far, so good.

377
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,340
For those of you that don't know,

378
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,440
Lumi is the York Trading Club portfolio manager,

379
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,700
and he does this a lot of the time. So we had a nice call earlier today,

380
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,500
and he shared with me some code.

381
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:38,790
Okay,

382
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,200
so let us go back here now. And what we're gonna do is,

383
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,360
we're gonna introduce shorting, right? And that's one way, guys. So, oh, shit.

384
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,780
Remember when we had all the portfolios here? Let me go. Ah, it's okay.

385
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,780
Remember when we had all the different assets here? Well,

386
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:05,390
we could actually move our efficient frontier like this by introducing shorting.

387
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,660
Okay, so that's what we're gonna do.

388
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,420
So Dan's saying, does doubling your risk equal doubling your return?

389
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,500
That's a very good point, Dan, and the answer is no. That's a very good point.

390
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,880
But it's almost a yes. Okay, it's almost a yes, but the answer is no.

391
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,770
Okay, so we're going to introduce shorting.

392
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,190
So now with our portfolio,

393
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,410
we're gonna say the minimum we can have now is negative 0.6.

394
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,810
Pulumi, what did I have here again now?

395
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,100
I think we just didn't have anything. Okay, let's do this now.

396
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,240
So here we go.

397
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,600
Okay, so,

398
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,020
hmm, sorry, guys, one second.

399
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,950
Oh, man, I should have saved the code. Yo, Pulumi,

400
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,390
what did I do differently here now? Oh,

401
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,110
there it is, guys. You see that? No one saw a little dot, right?

402
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,710
I was telling Sean the other day, I was doing some code. I spent three hours,

403
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,130
I was looking, I was like, why the hell is this not working?

404
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,070
Turns out I forgot a D. I forgot a D in some word. Today.

405
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,720
In 8,000 lines of code. Fuck that.

406
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,240
So let's do that again, guys.

407
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,370
Let's give that a second to load.

408
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,650
Yeah, one little dot.

409
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,320
Imagine guys trying to find that in like thousands of lines of code. Like,

410
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm surprised coders don't have the shortest lifespan. I think they do.

411
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,080
I think they do. It's just, it's a relatively new thing, so, you know. Exactly.

412
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,720
Just haven't seen it yet. That's a good point. Okay, guys,

413
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,240
so look at our new holdings right now, right? We got 56% XLP,

414
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,800
and we actually introduced a little bit of leverage, right? 56% XLP,

415
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:26,570
negative 14% XLU. 12% GLD, basically no SLV. USD CAD, short,

416
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,320
and long USD Aussie. Now, if we take a look at this super quick, guys,

417
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
what's happening here, right?

418
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,860
The market's basically saying that there's some alpha,

419
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:41,920
or the optimizer is basically saying there's some alpha holding XLP over XLU,

420
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,840
right? And once we own gold, well, there's no real point in owning any silver,

421
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,690
okay? So that is what this portfolio is telling us.

422
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,360
And we can chart the weights, and you guys can see that, right?

423
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,730
So let us run this portfolio.

424
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:03,910
Okay.

425
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,970
Oh, man. I did something wrong here.

426
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:28,260
Okay, guys, well, basically, oh, man, we did this earlier, too. It was so good.

427
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,160
Oh, man. That's a shame.

428
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
So every time you wanna do something in real time,

429
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,540
terminal's a perfect example, guys.

430
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,060
Palman, you around?

431
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,930
No time for bathroom breaks, dude.

432
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,350
So everything looks fine. Yeah, everything does look good. Oh, man,

433
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,010
that's such a shame.

434
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,310
Okay. Guys, I have to figure that one out. But basically, when we did this,

435
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:11,030
we basically increased our sharp to 0.52, and our return was 0.03.

436
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:20,090
So we were able to increase our total portfolio by improving on our,

437
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,370
by adding in shorting to our portfolio, right?

438
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,390
And what that also allowed us to do was increase leverage, right?

439
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,990
If we're- Try running one more time. Okay. If we're long XLP and short XLU,

440
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,210
well, we can kind of increase our leverage.

441
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,620
Was it the add constraint, Blumi? I can't remember.

442
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,960
Did I have to remove the weight sum constraint?

443
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,710
It's saying remove it.

444
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:16,100
Sorry, guys. Give me one second here. We did figure it out earlier today.

445
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,040
Here's the code for it. I got the code right here, Blumi.

446
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,760
Let's see what we did.

447
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,020
No, we had it in there, bud. Nope, no, we didn't.

448
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
You took out the weight sum.

449
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,920
I have a hashtag there.

450
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,230
Okay, let's just give it one more shot, guys.

451
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,520
Yeah.

452
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,080
Yeah, it's a shame.

453
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,210
Sorry, dudes.

454
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,810
Oh, this is... I mean, this worked. I don't know. I don't think this is...

455
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah, I don't think this is ideal.

456
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,300
I think there's a little bug that we did on the shorting one. But anyways,

457
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,320
let's take a look at this, guys. When we introduce shorting here, right?

458
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,940
You can see that.

459
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,500
So the black line is our strategy and the red is the equal weight.

460
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,240
So you can see that our drawdowns go down significantly, right?

461
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,020
Our P&L looks fantastic here.

462
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,960
And this is usually what happens when you induce shorting into a portfolio,

463
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,080
right? If you think that stock X is gonna outperform stock Y, well,

464
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:42,600
you can get a lot of stock Y and short some stock X and have a really smooth portfolio.

465
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,040
So you can see here, right? Our Sharpe ratio increased quite a bit to 0.57.

466
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,720
Okay, this is similar to what we got, to what we got for me.

467
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,780
So we increased our Sharpe ratio now two and a half times, guys. Right,

468
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,340
we went almost two and a half times our previous Sharpe ratio.

469
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,610
Dan, I just wanted to go back to one of Dan's point. Dan,

470
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,710
the reason why we don't see the efficient frontier go like this and we see it kind

471
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:20,710
of curve off like that, Dan, is because as we increase the risk, like you said,

472
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,470
right? It doesn't necessarily, it starts to taper off, right?

473
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,650
Because of that leverage factor that you were talking about.

474
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,270
Okay, so we'll stop there, guys.

475
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,070
That's just an example of how you can optimize a portfolio. I'm not saying,

476
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,870
you know, optimize an R, but the whole point here is,

477
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:50,490
is once we can add diversified strategies, diversified assets into a portfolio,

478
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:56,610
well, all of a sudden we can run something now that is, you know,

479
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,450
gonna outperform the market, right? On a risk-adjusted basis,

480
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,550
which we can get leverage to and increase our total return.

481
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,300
That was actually one of Renato's questions was,

482
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,320
can we do this with diversified strategies? 100%, right?

483
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,020
That's a portfolio manager. A portfolio manager is running multiple strategies.

484
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,820
Or if I'm a huge portfolio manager, let's say Goldman,

485
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,600
I'm like head of the derivatives desk, right? Well,

486
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,220
I got traders under me who are all running their strategies and I'm allocating to

487
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,360
them.

488
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,840
I'm allocating money to each trader and all their trades are in the global book.

489
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,790
And I think that's the best way to do it, right? Super, you know,

490
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:41,670
super simple example is shortfall, right? You got shortfall here and we got,

491
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,730
let's say long fall here, right? Well, these are negatively correlated.

492
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,900
So if these are both good strategies and they're negatively correlated, well,

493
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,620
now our P&L is gonna look a lot smoother.

494
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,780
Yeah, if you had a good long fall and a good shortfall strategy, you run both,

495
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,460
you weight them appropriately, your P&L doesn't chop around.

496
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,520
Jack is saying, so is that the same concept with the leverage strat? No.

497
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,120
So a little bit, Jacko, right? You have two portfolios, right?

498
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:31,280
You have ETN one and you have ETN two and both have some negative auto-correlation.

499
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,950
And because they're leveraged, they tend to go like this, right?

500
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:44,150
So if you short both of these and these are negative one correlated, well,

501
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:51,550
now your stream is gonna look very smooth on the way down. But as we know,

502
00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:00,970
there is some very fat tails for the strategy that don't come around very often.

503
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,910
They come around actually very seldomly, but they are there.

504
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,140
And Dan says, doesn't Dalio leverage up his all weather fund? I'm sure he does,

505
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,140
right? Usually you'll see guys go up to two times leverage, right?

506
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,220
So you're running, let's say 10K, Dan, let's say,

507
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:26,100
or let's say they're running $1 billion, okay, at the all weather strategy.

508
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,900
Well, their assets under management right now are gonna be 2 billion. Okay,

509
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,920
they're gonna control $2 billion worth of assets with a $1 billion portfolio.

510
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,270
And they're gonna have multiple, under here,

511
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:46,050
they're gonna have multiple strats or multiple assets and strategies, right?

512
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,890
That's gonna increase their Sharpe ratio,

513
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:54,210
which is gonna allow them to leverage, right? You can't leverage ACB,

514
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,900
right? You can't leverage this, but you can leverage SPY, right?

515
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,840
Because it has a lower return, a lower risk parameter,

516
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,680
and you can obviously leverage that.

517
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,540
So Dan saying, why does leverage decrease return in ETN strat,

518
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:25,000
but increase return here? Okay, so Dan, it's a really good point. So with the,

519
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:32,640
these ETNs, so these ETNs, Dan, are, they don't have positive expectancy,

520
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,870
right? And the reason is this, these things are negatively auto-correlated,

521
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,120
and they have negative expectancy, right? So it's, it's,

522
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,040
being long has negative expectancy. Right, being long has negative expectancy,

523
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,110
but it's not, and like, again, as you can see on this graph here,

524
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,350
when we draw the, I think that's actually a really good question, Dan.

525
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,020
It's a really, really good question.

526
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,970
So remember when we drew that graph, Dan, right?

527
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:17,170
And we said the efficient frontier looks like this,

528
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,800
right? It doesn't scale,

529
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,840
okay? And that's because of that leverage factor, right? As we,

530
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:40,540
that 10% down is not the same as the 10% up, right? Now,

531
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,700
if the ETNs had positive expectancy, right?

532
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,980
If the ETNs had a positive expectancy, then it would be,

533
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,620
it would make sense to buy them both.

534
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,720
Does that make sense, Dan? Right,

535
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,680
but because they're both going down like this,

536
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:10,120
we can make money by holding them, right? And it's, it's, you know, like,

537
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,400
the way to think about it is, you wouldn't buy 3x ETN1 for the long-term.

538
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,640
Right. You wouldn't buy and hold it for the long-term.

539
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,820
You wouldn't buy and hold ETN2 for the long-term, right?

540
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,060
Actually, okay. Actually, I got a really good way to explain this, Dan.

541
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,970
I got a good way to explain this, Dan. You got, you got NASDAQ, okay?

542
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:37,850
You got NASDAQ,

543
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:49,340
that, and you have the leveraged ETF, TQQ, okay? Well, TQQ, right?

544
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,840
The ETN actually does really well. It does very, very, very well.

545
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,700
And that's because QQQ has a positive expectancy, right?

546
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,920
So this is going to do very well. But what about SQQQ,

547
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,660
right? Well, this has negative expectancy, okay?

548
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,760
And because of the insane leverage,

549
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,040
right? And the choppiness, right? The auto-correl,

550
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,380
the negative auto-correlation,

551
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,250
this strategy should make money. And the actual thing is, Dan, we see NASDAQ,

552
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,910
for example, actually trend. We see NASDAQ trend most of the time.

553
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,360
So for that reason, this pair right here is not a good pair, usually.

554
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,610
This is usually not a good pair to trade. But if we have a pair like,

555
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,350
let's say, DGAS and UGAS,

556
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,900
where the vol is all over the place, and UNG doesn't move anywhere,

557
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,640
it just goes like this, well, now this is gonna play out, okay?

558
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,900
But even on a sharp ratio of three, Dan, right? Think about it like this.

559
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,580
On a sharp ratio of three, you still can't put your full account on here,

560
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,760
because there is a point where you will drop down to almost zero, right?

561
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,200
And then what? Then you're never coming back up, no matter how much.

562
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,700
So that's why. It's the insane leverage here. Even on a good strategy, Dan,

563
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,480
if you had the amount of leverage that these ETNs have,

564
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,240
you wouldn't be able to make money.

565
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,680
Are we at 155? Okay, so,

566
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,840
oh man, these chats are getting so busy now, man. It's good. Yeah, it's good,

567
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,260
it's really good.

568
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,000
Okay, guys, if you have any questions right now, post them in right now.

569
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,410
I'm just gonna be watching the chat. Any questions? So Ko is asking,

570
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:08,730
can we just be short SQQQ and long TQQQ?

571
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:19,780
No, you can't be short SQQ and long TQQQ, right? If, like, TQQ,

572
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,910
you make money when it goes up, right? And SQQQ,

573
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:37,580
you lose money when the NASDAQ goes up, right? So,

574
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:45,080
can we just be short?

575
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,660
Koa, okay, I don't know why I can't see this right now,

576
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,300
but you cannot be long one and short the other. You gotta be short both.

577
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,300
Are you exposed to the same thing?

578
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,140
Oh, yeah, okay, Tico, sorry, man. I don't know why I couldn't see that there.

579
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,350
What happens if NASDAQ goes down? What if NASDAQ goes down, right?

580
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,010
You lose on both sides. Oh, you're gonna lose on this,

581
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:16,810
and you're gonna lose on that.

582
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,720
So Jack is saying, how do we optimize portfolio with multiple strats? So,

583
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,060
obviously, the answer is you have to run it through a computer.

584
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,420
You have to pull the data, see what you get, and do it.

585
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,940
But there's other ways around that, right? You can also think about, well,

586
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,500
what is your strategy, right? That's why we usually break it down to two.

587
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,820
Is it a long vol strategy, or is it a short vol strategy?

588
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,120
If it's a long vol strategy, right? And you can look at your P&L, right?

589
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,420
You can say, okay, well, my expected return from this long vol strategy is,

590
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,100
let's say, 10%, right?

591
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,740
And it's negatively correlated with my short vol strategy that's making,

592
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,660
let's say, 50%. Well,

593
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,300
maybe there's a weight I can do here where I'm probably gonna be long,

594
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,200
you know, most of the short vol strat,

595
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,300
and then I'm gonna have some of that hedge to back it up, right, example.

596
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,100
Buying equity, buying,

597
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,940
and then buying deep out-of-the-money puts with a very small percentage of your

598
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,560
account just to give you that kicker.

599
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,140
So Hugh just saying, what is expectancy?

600
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,620
Expectancy is basically what you expect to make, right? What do you expect?

601
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,600
What's your expected value in the trade, right?

602
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,020
It's like when you go to a blackjack table,

603
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,800
your expectancy is negative two cents per bet. Every time I bet on average,

604
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,570
every time I bet a dollar, on average, I'm gonna lose two cents, okay?

605
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,150
That's what expectancy is.

606
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,690
If both go down, Jed says we drink. Yeah. That's it,

607
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,370
and we got a little mattress for you here, Tico, as well. Exactly.

608
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,170
So with that said, guys, it's nine o'clock.
