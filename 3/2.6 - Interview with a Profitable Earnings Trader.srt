I think April is my one year Wow Unreal and basically Josh is the the go-to earnings

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,380
guy at predicting alpha since day one. It's been the strategy that you know,

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,100
I think it comes from him loving a good gamble,

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,240
but it was the one that spoke to him the most and he's just gone hard at it ever

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,520
since and That's what we're really here to talk about what it takes to crush a strategy

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,500
because this last earning season man like unbelievable Yeah,

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,980

you see my story you see Sean story and you know,

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
well at the end of day we are running predicting alpha so I think hearing from someone

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,720
who has nothing to sell and who is literally Just grinding it out,

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,300
right and and really what it takes to to build a profitable strategy what it takes

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,740
to be a profitable trader and And that's really what you know,

26
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,380

29
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,710

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,030
I want to chat with you about get your opinion, you know,

31
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,090
and then of course You know really inspire the people on the team here.

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,240
Let's get into it Um, so hutch when did you first start trading or you know,

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,780
what like when did you really get into trading?

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:33,260
Yeah uh So I started trading probably four or five years ago. Um I i'm 29.

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,760
So I mean like a decent chunk of my life, right? I mean not you know,

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,200
four or five years doesn't seem like that long but being 29 pretty decent pretty

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,070
decent amount. So Yeah, and like, uh,

38
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,550
you know when you were first starting out what kind of what kind of strategies were

39
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,070
you running there?

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,180
So I so when I first started trading I went straight to options.

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,240
So I never like dabbled in like delta one or anything like that um I've always liked

42
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,720
leverage. I've been a real estate investor for a while.

43
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,740
And so leverage just makes sense to me. Um,

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,640
I Started out with credit spreads or shorting verticals is what you guys call it.

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,950
Um are mainly around uh Moving averages like crop like crossing Uh,

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,590
like pull across bear cross moving averages selling credit spreads at that um And

47
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,510
then after that started taking my hedge off going naked uh shorts right Uh here

48
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,110
and there and then right around the time that I joined,

49
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,250
uh predicting alpha I was doing a lot of delta 30 strangles.

50
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,160
So um I was shorting, uh,

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,860
I was shorting strangles and then I would go for like high Volatile high premium.

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
I would pack it on Um, you know to get in and out of the trade,

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,680
you know in a few in a few days um You know to try to just like scalp premium basically

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,100
and then You guys found me when I found myself assigned to a shit ton of short shares

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,440
on a stock that went vertical And I was in a bad place. Uh, so So, yeah,

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,060
that's that's kind of that was kind of the evolution to how I got into vol You know,

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,680
what's funny hutch is that that video is actually saved on uh Was saved on my computer

58
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,080
before it got erased. So, oh, no, did you lose it? That's gone. Yeah,

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,920
that's gone Oh, that's okay. Yeah, i'm not i'm not mad that it's gone, but Um,

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,700
and so like hutch what were your signals like what would like what would tell you

61
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,000
like hey,

62
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,320
you know This is a good thing to short ball or this is a good strangle to do like

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,140
what was your mindset at the time? Right. Yeah,

64
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,080
so for the strangles for the for the non-directional like premium scalping Uh,

65
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,740
I mean and I mean now looking back I realized that okay I'm collecting variance

66
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,460
risk premium like on these like highly volatile names people don't know whether

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,200
they're going up 10 or down 10 Um,

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,520
you know those delta 30 strangles were really wide, right? um, and so and so,

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:01,980
uh,

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,060
that's that's kind of what I was doing there my signals for The credit spreads around

71
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,240
moving averages was I was looking for a building rsi And a bull cross and so I usually

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,700
like to trade them from a uh from a from a bullish standpoint Um selling the credit

73
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,940
spread below, you know selling the selling the put uh spread below. Um, Uh,

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,740
you know below the moving average as as a cross that's that's simply what I was

75
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,360
doing I think it's a super actually popular strategy amongst the retail traders.

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
We have a few members here who were uh,

77
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,960
Who were you know doing credit spreads and uh,

78
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,740
you know directional credit spreads, you know,

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,940
nothing wrong with that If you find an edge,

80
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,440
but uh I'm sure you learned on the hard way as well, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,480
No, I mean because because for a gambler like myself, uh,

82
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,500
it's hard to Just bring in the human bias to things.

83
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,320
It's hard to stay disciplined scalping like that little of like premium, right?

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,100
It's like, you know 70 bucks here 50 bucks here, right?

85
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,480
And so it's just hard to stay disciplined on that stuff.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,900
And so inevitably you're going to go to higher premium stuff And then you're going

87
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,180
to be short and strangles on overstock like I was right to get more premium but

88
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,260
when there's more premium there's more risk and You know,

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
that's what you're not always taking into account And then when you get into the

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,020
voma and you know how the wings like,

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,380
you know expand on you or whatever Which I didn't learn until like here recently

92
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,220
um that you know,

93
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,000
it gets it's a lot more complicated than you're than you're doing and that's pa's

94
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,620
Uh, that's that's pa's like calling card, right? It's like hey,

95
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,680
you're taking risks that you don't understand, right? It's not bad,

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,160
but you need to understand them, right? nice um, and and so much you're like,

97
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,640
uh, you know, You you I should always say like you are the earnings guy, right?

98
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,100
You are the earnings guy And I was curious to know like what draws you to earning

99
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,020
so much Yeah, and maybe you can actually uh,

100
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,040
if you can maybe explain a little bit Just like in a nutshell about your strategy

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,980
and we're going to go more into detail about it But maybe in a nutshell,

102
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,820
can you maybe explain to people why you like it and and what you're doing?

103
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,480
Yeah So me being the earnings guy is not self-proclaimed.

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm going to say that You guys you guys tagged me as the earnings guy,

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,800
which I mean, I love earnings.

106
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,850
That's that's for sure um But I mean my question to that is like what what's not

107
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,530
to love about earnings as a trader, right? It's got the volatility.

108
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,450
It's got the in and out in the day Uh, it's got the rush.

109
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,250
It's got it's got frequency.

110
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,630
You always know what's going to happen There's a ton of plays.

111
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,230
There's a ton of momentum So I I I love all of that from from from that standpoint.

112
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,910
Um,

113
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:52,120
also One thing that I don't think we talk about enough is uh is when you're when

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,840
you're making positive expected value bets Which we can explain expected value here

115
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,220
in a little bit,

116
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,060
but for everybody that's tracking with me When you're making positive expected value

117
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,880
bets, it's all about frequency because Because of the law of big numbers,

118
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,000
even though you might be making a positive EV bet You need to make a lot of them

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,040
so that your edge plays out over time If you're making one or two isolated positive

120
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,140
EV bets, right? Like you can hit tails six times in a row Right,

121
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,300
but you need to make sure that you flip 500 times To make sure that you have a positive

122
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,900
edge over time and earning trading gives you frequency, right?

123
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,020
The market doesn't all the time give you a trade, right?

124
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,200
And so and so because the market can be stubborn sometimes in giving you trades

125
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,060
and giving you opportunities I like earnings because it has that you always know

126
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,460
that earnings come is coming around So you always know that you have frequency so

127
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,200
that your edge is going to play out over time. So um Yeah, I love it.

128
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,380
And I love the like peaks.

129
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,720
I like I make fun of like how oh earning season is done I'm gonna go into withdrawals

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,820
and all that stuff like I make jokes about that But it's really fun to like go really

131
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,780
really hard and then kind of like take a step back read more Research more and everything.

132
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,200
I think that's really awesome to be able to do that.

133
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:18,880
But my strategy um I I'm very reliant on the terminal Um for for my earning strategy,

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,920
so I mean the earnings tab is what got me into it is what's kept me through it um,

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,040
and my strategy got better when Jordan's data got better, so um, I mean Yeah,

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,100
i'm highly reliant on the on the uh on the terminal So in the earnings tab,

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,040
I like to see at least a two percent edge, uh implied move to average move Um,

138
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,850
I like to see seasonality Relatively low.

139
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,390
I'm not as strict about that as some of the other earnings boys Uh,

140
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,830
Daniel's chuckling right now margin's probably chuckling right now as well.

141
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,210
I'm not as strict about that I like to see the straddle not profitable the long

142
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,190
straddle not profitable Um,

143
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,510
I don't like to see a lot of big moves I like to see I like to see the you know

144
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:07,670
for the straddle a not profitable long straddle Means that the market is consistently

145
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,190
Systematically overpricing this event, right?

146
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,370
And so that's when I want to be a seller Um,

147
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,970
I like to and this is this is relatively new Jordan,

148
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,690
me and you talked about this at length this weekend,

149
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,910
but the term structure I want to see a very steep term structure um So that we can

150
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,050
get that collapse. I want to see low realized vol. Um Uh, so,

151
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,130
you know if the stock isn't moving like a ton, right? um and uh,

152
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:43,530
and I like to see a substantial edge in Event vol so I want to have high event vol

153
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,150
in relatively low non-event vol like,

154
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,330
you know In the 20 to 30 range i'll take something less than that,

155
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,990
but I like to see 20 to 30 range That's what gets me interested then going directly

156
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,390
to the brokerage.

157
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,410
I like to see relatively high volume I have some questions that some guys sent me

158
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,370
about how I take low volume trades uh,

159
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,130
which is kind of funny to me because that's something that I look at that I filter

160
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:15,520
things out by but um Yeah, real like pretty good volume So so in a nutshell,

161
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,200
you're basically uh selling uh volatility collecting that risk premium But then

162
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,020
you're also adding this extra filter to try to like wean out What are the best trades

163
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,660
and what are like maybe just okay trades would you would you say that's about accurate?

164
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,660
Yeah, no,

165
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,540
I mean that's good I mean and when you're talking about so if you look at the if

166
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,760
you look at the definition of the equation of Expected value it is is it is amount

167
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,940
that you're going to win Or or amount that you're going to lose times the probability

168
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,240
of that happening, right?

169
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,780
So in my mind probability of that happening means i'm building confidence with my

170
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,280
data, right? So that's why I have all of those checklists, right?

171
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,520
If I go through my checklist and I say hey,

172
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,060
this is this is why the market is overpricing this event It builds the probability

173
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,700
that i'm right right because no one knows if they're right or wrong But all you

174
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,780
can do is take a bet right? And so yes I love that.

175
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,420
I love that With uh with this last earning season, right?

176
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,040
It sounds like you're doing a lot of filtering How many trades do you think you

177
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,390
took in just this last earning season? Uh,

178
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:28,540
that's a good question um off the top of my head I I think I I think I pasted return

179
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,900
numbers here. I don't think I pasted frequency man. I'd say 50 or 60 Okay,

180
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,140
yeah,

181
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,200
so that's a lot of filtering then because there's you know hundreds of events,

182
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,820
uh, yeah a lot more than even the seasons before Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,400
So I mean when margin and I started trading, uh,

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Trading earnings like we took everything we took everything that moved,

185
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,700
you know what I mean? Like I mean, we like I was posting hundreds,

186
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,940
you know what I mean? Just like just like scripts, right?

187
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,500
um a lot of my pickiness and my filtering,

188
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,900
uh came down to Me going naked instead of buying wings too.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,960
So I got a lot more picky when that happened Um, which I think has been great.

190
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:17,990
Um, we've we are our win percentage has gone way up um and um Sorry,

191
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,250
I had a mosquito that was flying around my desk um, and uh, yeah,

192
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,090
our win percentage has gone way up and I think I think it's been great. Yeah.

193
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,830
I mean, yeah picky for sure I don't take very much long ball either you know,

194
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,590
I I took some heat from that from somebody in the chat after I posted my rules for

195
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,990
long ball and they were Like that's never gonna happen. I was like, well,

196
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,430
I mean I I have a positive win percentage and it's pop, you know,

197
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,030
and my strategy is positive, right? So yeah,

198
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,190
let you know a little bit less frequency, but it's not like i'm taking,

199
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,090
you know I'm, not taking trades, right?

200
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,190
I took like 60 trades in a couple months,

201
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,550
which is a lot How many trades do you think you were winning?

202
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:02,050
What was your win percentage do you think yeah around 80? Wow Yeah, well,

203
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,750
I mean dude this season was insane.

204
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,570
I don't think it's going to be that high I think it'll probably settle more around

205
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,770
like this 70 percent range,

206
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:17,420
but like yeah around 80 Um and so hodge like You know,

207
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,020
you've placed I think honestly,

208
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,560
I think you've placed officially more earnings trades than I have and you know a

209
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,200
lot of traders,

210
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,380
um They kind of get stuck like really understanding Uh getting better and like building

211
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,500
a business, right?

212
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,660
Because like I feel like the way you're talking about it right now is like you're

213
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,020
talking about your business, right? There's always going to be earnings.

214
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,840
You're always going to be employed um You know,

215
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,780
so and you're like constantly working on that business You know,

216
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,000
so you've let's say done 500 earnings trades.

217
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,240
Um and like from all that experience,

218
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,440
you know from where you were when you started out Trying to build this business

219
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,960
to where you are now What like what have you learned like what are some of the important

220
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:10,730
things you've learned along that journey of building that business Yeah um uh Probably

221
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,330
probably too much to like just straight up like pontificate here, right?

222
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,390
Like a lot. Um,

223
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,700
but like just high level um Knowing your edge backwards and forwards, right?

224
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,850
So That's one thing. Um You gotta know when things don't seem right,

225
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:39,090
right like but We got an earnings trader in the making yeah,

226
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:48,620
that's right uh so So you I mean But knowing when things don't seem right uh you

227
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,680
know in like cause for more like,

228
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,000
uh Experimentation and like digging into like fundamentals and everything that kind

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,520
of comes just with like trading a bunch of trades, right? You're kind of like,

230
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,800
okay. This just doesn't this doesn't feel right, right?

231
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,920
So that just comes with like, uh familiarity with the markets,

232
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,420
but knowing your edge backwards and forwards I think is really really important

233
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,880
because new things are going to come into the market new like Strategies and ways

234
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,060
of thinking about things and each season's different and stuff like that So knowing

235
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,180
things backwards and forwards and knowing why your edge is there knowing why you

236
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,200
have an advantage there um So that you can continue to isolate that right?

237
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,220
So we we dropped the wings here recently and when I say wing,

238
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:36,010
I mean I when I say we like I literally mean Me I talked to some guys about it,

239
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,750
right? So i'm talking to these guys and i'm like,

240
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,890
hey I think i'm gonna drop the wings. I think this is what i'm gonna do, right?

241
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,330
Neil thought I was off my rocker, right?

242
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,370
Neil was like hutch don't do this Don't don't drop the wings right and I was like,

243
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,270
here's the here's the thing. Here's my logic, right?

244
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,270
And that was all about isolating my advantage, right?

245
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,010
I felt like the wings were costing me too much I felt like they were reducing my

246
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,790
edge on on execution on fill execution And so it's about isolating my edge because

247
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,030
I know my edge like I know my advantage when it comes to that trade um,

248
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:16,680
and then finally probably uh if you see a A banger like if you like if you see like

249
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,850
a okay can't miss trade Never gonna be 100% Prop, you know,

250
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,030
i'm never gonna be 100% sure but like a pre-release, right?

251
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,890
We had a couple pre-releases this season,

252
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,030
which i'm sure we're gonna talk about on this uh like coals Which was my biggest

253
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:40,550
pnl ever on a trade uh That was a pre-release our our our conviction on that trade

254
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,970
was so high Like I poured through all the releases I worked my ass off on that trade.

255
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,110
My conviction was so high and I got my chips in the middle, right?

256
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,810
So if i'm up against jordan heads up in a poker match and I have the nuts and he's

257
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,150
coming out strong I'm doing absolutely everything I can to get all of the chips

258
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,210
in the middle, right? And so and so like i'm selling things.

259
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,710
I was doing this with coal. I'm selling things.

260
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,590
I'm shedding leverage I'm shedding my margin, right?

261
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,710
I'm getting it all in i'm figuring out what can go wrong and i'm hedging that right

262
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,430
i'm getting it all in. Um,

263
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,430
so being able to find The banger trade and and really really really press on it.

264
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:27,120
Um, so and that's that's recently learned um, so Yeah, so I guess uh,

265
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,840
I guess you're not a fan of those people i'd say, uh,

266
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,740
Talk about the two percent rule Man,

267
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,660
I I mean I follow a percent rule for max loss, right?

268
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,160
So but that's on my like normal earnings trade, right?

269
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,760
And I mean when when I and and i'll walk you through that cold straight,

270
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,720
you know, i'll i'll talk about it later Uh, you know,

271
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,340
I can walk through that cold straight I was taking probably 10% risk like the max

272
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,580
loss on that trade was probably 10% risk on my account which is large right is is

273
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,360
large for a For for a trader,

274
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,660
I think that's that's that's that's large but like yeah,

275
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,440
I mean it I But I was using all of my available margin to get to that 10% too because

276
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,600
I was selling it naked So I was you know, anyways, but yeah, I mean,

277
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't hate the people that say two percent Especially when you're your size jordan

278
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,420
with your account, right?

279
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,680
Like two percent is still sizable and you're taking you can take pretty much any

280
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,520
trade that the market throws out there any structure It doesn't matter with two

281
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,810
percent of your account, right? so I don't I don't hate them, but I mean Yeah,

282
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,070
it's being able to push it, you know,

283
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,890
push it all in Follow for your for your earnings trading.

284
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:44,100
How did you pick that percent? Uh, oh the percent rule Yeah,

285
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,940
like the rule that you follow for your trading right?

286
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,780
Is it arbitrary or did you? Factor something in this decision. Yeah Uh, yeah,

287
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,060
I mean loosely based off of some of the things that I read and listened to you guys

288
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,940
about kelly Criterion, right? So that three to five percent max loss um,

289
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:09,520
you know being ideal like that's just kind of In general in general some respected

290
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,330
traders that I read uh that I listen to uh that talk about Long-term betting strategies

291
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,150
say that that three to five percent is is is pretty safe Um,

292
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,850
and I feel confident in my edge.

293
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,130
And so I typically go five about five percent But you're naked on these positions.

294
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,890
Yeah, how are you pricing that three to five percent? Yeah. Yeah,

295
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,190
so i'm stressing the position um,

296
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:42,810
so i'm taking what I do for my stress is I load up my proposed position into thinkorswim

297
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,490
And then I stress it to the biggest move that that uh,

298
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,490
Security has had on earnings ever so I go through it doesn't matter season either

299
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,070
okay,

300
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,950
so we're looking at one cue data right now like I'm looking like if if this thing

301
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,450
moved twenty percent four cue two years ago That's the one i'm taking right?

302
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,610
So if that thing took twenty percent i'm taking that twenty percent i'm stressing

303
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,290
this to twenty percent um I don't stress vols upwards Um,

304
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,890
because i'm already i'm already selling into beak. I mean steep,

305
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,610
uh backwardization and so I don't think Vol really increases after this event very

306
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,870
much That's a little uh,

307
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,530
that's a little nuance and a little complicated so I can circle back around to that

308
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,050
But i'm not stressing balls up, but I am stressing move, right?

309
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,090
So i'm stressing biggest move ever and then I take so I take one lot.

310
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,590
I literally do this This is what I do. I take the proposed trade.

311
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,130
I put it in I stress it to twenty percent Or whatever it is,

312
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,710
whatever that move is the biggest one for the security And then I take the loss

313
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,790
for that at that twenty percent move and I multiply that up to five percent of my

314
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:54,530
account That's my process Got it I like that new word beak.

315
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,130
It's a steep backwardation Yeah, that's uh,

316
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:06,090
that's what it is Uh hutch you actually you you touched on something there that

317
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,450
i'd actually like to chat about um, you said,

318
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,860
you know Neil said you were crazy right,

319
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,420
um How important do you think it is to have a team? Right and uh,

320
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,380
like a lot of traders think I gotta trade in the zone It's all about me,

321
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,040
you know me me me, but how important did you find it?

322
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,910
Like it is actually To have a team to be able to bounce ideas off someone Yeah,

323
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,860
dude so I don't want to give margin a big head here,

324
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:42,000
but like i've got i've got a man crush on our team like I think it's Probably the

325
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,640
probably the most important thing that has happened to me like on my trading career

326
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:55,420
Being able to have high level conversations With guys who are grinding it out And

327
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,260
being able to talk those things out. I'm an external processor too, right?

328
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:06,880
So like I I I back At I back into things As i'm talking like I do it all the time

329
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,360
And so being able to talk things out dude We were up until I mean my time almost

330
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,440
midnight last night talking about forward vols Right after that live like after

331
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,980
the live Which i'm sorry for everybody who wanted a technical live after last night.

332
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,760
This is not a technical live that one was but uh,

333
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,200
we were up to I was almost to midnight and i'm old, right? I'm,

334
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,540
almost 30 years old. I don't stay up until midnight, right?

335
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:40,000
And we were 29 29 So, I mean, yeah, so So I don't stay up until midnight.

336
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,540
We were talking about forward vols the whole time,

337
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,560
right and talking about Uh margins trade on uh on uh,

338
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,960
william sonoma He fucking crushed it, right? It was awesome,

339
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,940
and I didn't understand it And so we we talked about it and steve jumped in and

340
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,540
and being able to have high level conversations and really work out edges Is is

341
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,880
so huge and jordan doesn't answer his dms.

342
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:04,770
So I have to find somebody else Yeah margins margins a great resource there We'll

343
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,290
have to have them on one time Yeah um Okay.

344
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,350
So before we like really dive into uh Into the strategy and like,

345
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,610
uh you know what like what you're really doing, uh behind the scenes,

346
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,800
you know time commitment and um All that good stuff Um,

347
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,520
where do you think a lot of traders go wrong? Right?

348
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,800
Like we have we you know We have newer members in the group who are uh You know,

349
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,760
they want to get to a position where you are, right?

350
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,580
um And and what do you like?

351
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,060
What do you say to someone who is or maybe even maybe not someone else?

352
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,200
But if you were to talk to yourself You know when you were starting out like what

353
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,820
do you say to someone who's trying to grow a business?

354
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:55,630
We're trying to grow their business um so so Get data as fast as possible like good

355
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,180
data um and understand the data Um,

356
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,680
so that was I mean that transformed my trading just being able to have it and and

357
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,280
i'm an engineer I always i've known that data was important for a really long time.

358
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,740
But like but um, I dropped coding after grad school.

359
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,400
And so like I didn't really have a great way to process the data And a lot of the

360
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,500
like publicly available data on stuff like stock twits and you know I mean like

361
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,300
like like screeners like publicly, you know use screeners and everything.

362
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,040
They're just not they're not super reliable Um,

363
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,840
because they're not really processing the data from an operator's standpoint.

364
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,840
They're processing the data on an easy to understand standpoint um And so get good

365
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,840
reliable data um I'm,

366
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,380
probably preaching to the choir here for for people that are in pa but There's a

367
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,340
lot of new members Yeah, so so here's here's the thing.

368
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,800
Here's the thing these guys jordan and sean I remember so I remember right when

369
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,380
I got into pa And you guys started doing lives Back, then it was every night,

370
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:00,940
which I was like,

371
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,400
this isn't sustainable So i'm glad i'm glad that you guys went to three nights a

372
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,420
week. I think it's wise on your part Yeah,

373
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,200
I mean you're killing it like I was like dude when I when I started looking at the

374
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,340
data I was like, okay, this is this is pretty cool. Right?

375
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,120
And then the community is like, okay, you know,

376
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,260
we talk about trading That's cool, too Um,

377
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
and then and then and then you guys were like, hey,

378
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,520
we're gonna get on for an hour every night every day of the week And we're gonna

379
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,080
talk trading like you guys can ask questions.

380
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,740
We're gonna talk trading right when somebody is giving you that much time From a

381
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,520
business standpoint.

382
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,560
It's it's that much It's it's that much more time that you can see them fuck up

383
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,700
right like like from a from a business standpoint like Like if if I can make things

384
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,220
look shiny on the outside and they don't actually see that like i'm human Right,

385
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,500
and they see like my business from the outside and they're like, oh wow,

386
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,400
that's great, right? Uh, then then like it's easier to fool people, right?

387
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,170
But you guys are here Every single night going like hey, here's the thing.

388
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,390
I just took a huge drawdown, right?

389
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,570
That's how you know that they're a real trader, right?

390
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,790
So being in a community like this and people that are transparent and talk data

391
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:16,970
and talk um Talk trading talk the game right understand the game understand that

392
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:23,750
shit happens. Um, so Yeah, so that's so get good data get reliable data.

393
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,810
Honestly, I wish I would have never stopped coding Um, jordan's like yes,

394
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,390
I know But I was gonna say how much are we paying this guy? Sean?

395
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,590
He's really not boosting us up here, right?

396
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:42,990
Dude i'm sitting back. Yeah. No, so I mean Yeah, so anyways coding Um,

397
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,250
I I have a matlab background.

398
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,750
I wish I had transitioned that into r I mean that lab they say it's really easy

399
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:54,310
to transition into r but I didn't know jordan back then So he wasn't there to convince

400
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,190
me um, but uh, so that's that's what I would tell myself, uh,

401
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,180
And and where I see a lot of traders go wrong um I'm,

402
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,820
just going to use i'm going to use kind of an example um I mean,

403
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,420
i'm going to use an example and then i'll transition that into like a more like,

404
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,140
uh,

405
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,870
like broad like principle I see a lot of guys and I saw this last year when I first

406
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,250
started trading earnings, too Um,

407
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:31,100
I won't shout anybody out here but buying tight wings On earnings,

408
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,620
okay So like I I was telling guys about this when I was when I was trading a couple

409
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,700
seasons ago And I was really just starting to pick up into earnings Um,

410
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,820
and now i'm like after our talk Uh saturday I'm, like pounding.

411
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:51,080
I want to pound the table on this right? Buying tight wings reduces your edge.

412
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,620
Okay, so So I i'm seeing neil's messages pop up here. Uh, I Yes, neil.

413
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,620
No one listened to us.

414
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,400
So here I am with the stage and i'm gonna say listen to me So if you are if you're

415
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,780
looking at a trade that has eight percent implied move five percent average move

416
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,020
All the other stuff that I talked about steep backwardization good seasonality good

417
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,840
volume all the things that I was talking about, right? Uh,

418
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,400
no proclivity to move really big like all these things, right?

419
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,700
It's a great trade It's a it's a good trade you go to the chain and and you price

420
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,720
out the straddle you price out the wings and let's just say this is like a This

421
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,520
is like a mcdonald's. Okay, say this is a mcdonald's.

422
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,440
This is a big dollar stock It's like a $200 stock, right? And so you're like,

423
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,080
hey, I can't go naked on this. I'm gonna buy wings, right?

424
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
And so i'm buying the standard deviation on this thing is,

425
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,020
you know 18 20 bucks, right?

426
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,160
And so you start pricing out your five percent of your account blah blah blah You

427
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,420
go through your risk sizing all this stuff and you're like,

428
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,860
hey Like I can't I can't put on this trade because my my wings I have to take them

429
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,560
out here And that means my risk is too big on this trade. Okay?

430
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,880
What people were doing was tightening their wings in so that they could make the

431
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,500
trade based on their risk tolerance But what you did when you brought that in is

432
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,340
you reduced the move?

433
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,580
That you're covering You're that you're selling that ball around that move.

434
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:31,020
And so now you're selling a you're selling a six percent Move right or a five percent

435
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,820
move, right?

436
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,440
You're reducing that edge sometimes even a three or four percent move if you tighten

437
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,460
them enough, right?

438
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,520
And so and so that's the move that you're covering there where you're looking at

439
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,760
the data and saying Oh, well, i'm good out to an eight percent move,

440
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,380
but your structure doesn't reflect that right?

441
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,320
And so and so And so you got to look at your coverage If you're going out there

442
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,300
and buying vol you got to look at your coverage That's what that's what convinced

443
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,980
me to go start going naked, right?

444
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,220
Because sometimes I can get more like I can get that strangle and I can get more

445
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,460
than the implied move out there Um,

446
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,440
and so and so while you're struggling to get out of your wings Because the stock

447
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,480
moved six percent and you're only covering six percent and then you're wondering

448
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,040
why you broke even I i'm i'm covering eight percent and i've got my two percent

449
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,980
edge and i'm scalping that ball right there and i'm i'm loving life right Um,

450
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,800
so because the six percent is a pancake to me, right?

451
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,980
Six percent is a pancake to you, right?

452
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,040
So understanding and so here's my bigger principle, right?

453
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,820
Understand your edge Understand what your you know,

454
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,340
your structure there your structure has to reflect your advantage, right?

455
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,440
Does that make sense? I feel like I kind of rambled there. No, dude,

456
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,340
that's perfect Uh,

457
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,960
look at your structure and does that express the view that you that you think is

458
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,180
going to happen? Yeah, exactly.

459
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,100
I I know pernab was having some issues with that. Um, and what do you like,

460
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,580
uh hutch? So um What about the people that buy the wings? Is there anything?

461
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,980
When when they're going to buy wings, is there anything they should be wary of?

462
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,220
Let's say they're doing a two a three sd wing because or two and a half sd because

463
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,780
you know,

464
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,900
they can't short naked Um What do you say to people buying those wings? Yeah,

465
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,360
sure. So pay attention to skew That's a big thing that I was looking at right?

466
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,000
So if you're if you have a smiley skew So for any of the new people if you're looking

467
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,360
at the skew graph and you pull up the equity on the vol insights And the and the

468
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,900
skew goes make sure that i'm in the middle here and the skew goes like this,

469
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,200
right? It's smiley.

470
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,200
That means that at the money has a lower vol right and it skews outward So the farther

471
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,760
you go out on the wings the vol is more expensive Right.

472
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,060
And so when you're buying wings into skew,

473
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,100
you need to go farther out I would also consider when you're going three standard

474
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,320
deviations out That's going to take out a lot of the equities that you can trade,

475
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,660
right?

476
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,380
Because the volume is going to be at the money and you're going out very very far

477
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,640
So make sure you're looking at volume out there at the wings, right?

478
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,620
If there's only one contract that traded today on the wings It's not enough right

479
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,620
So I would look at the volume.

480
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:22,210
I would look at the skew and then I would consider from a from a uh Like a uh a

481
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:29,430
fill standpoint like a like a execution standpoint consider Selling the iron condor

482
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:34,810
buying those wings and then just and then just assuming that those wings are transaction

483
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:40,530
costs like Unless it blows out right unless it blows out and then your wing is super

484
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,390
valuable, right?

485
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,210
Then make sure you get a good fill on that but consider and look into um,

486
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,110
look into Selling the iron condor and then when it comes the next morning and your

487
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,510
edge is played out Then just buying back the straddle make sure you get a great

488
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,330
fill on that And then and then you know,

489
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,070
take your time getting out of the wings Maybe even let them go,

490
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,890
you know to back down to zero Um,

491
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,970
because you don't want to you don't want to pull it put in a whole order for the

492
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,630
iron condor Not get filled on a market maker perspective because your wings are

493
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,490
shitty, right?

494
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,550
And so if your wings are holding up your fill getting out of the trade Then you

495
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,850
might get fucked on the on the straddle, right?

496
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,950
So consider lagging out of it That's what they would say is lagging out of it leg

497
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,770
out of the straddle and then leg out of the wings Um, I would just consider it.

498
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,710
I'm not saying do it. I'm saying look at it Um,

499
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,640
you guys notice how the I just want to bring to attention hutch the way you're talking

500
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,700
about this, right? Like, you know every corner of your business.

501
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:45,860
Uh I think that's so important right like this is so different especially to a lot

502
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,020
of the new members here Uh, it's so different the way hutch is talking about.

503
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,760
Uh About this, right? It's like he knows every corner Of you know,

504
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,680
where like we're talking transaction costs.

505
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,940
We're talking execution We're talking, you know,

506
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,700
the vol space all that stuff like he knows every corner.

507
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,940
Uh Of this business model,

508
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:09,250
right and I I think that's so so important to understand as a trader um Yeah,

509
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,390
so, you know hutch the trade-off Yeah,

510
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,870
the trade-off there is you sometimes you wake up in a cold sweat thinking about

511
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,170
salesforce blowing out five standard deviations, right?

512
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,050
Every good business is worried about their competitor, right? Yeah,

513
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:28,980
that's right Um Okay,

514
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,720
so hutch you you mentioned there like for someone who is Uh,

515
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,640
who has a smaller account let's say right, you know,

516
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,100
they can't trade those they can't trade those ones, right? Yeah, you know,

517
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,930
so they bring the wings in so it can fit in their account size What's the deal there?

518
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,430
Yeah, right. I got a five thousand dollar account. I want to trade earnings.

519
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,890
What's the deal? Yeah Yeah, for sure Is pranav on this live?

520
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:00,640
um Dang it I hope he I hope he listens to the I hope he listens to the replay I

521
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,300
like pranav a lot. I think he's gonna be a great trader one day.

522
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,040
I I really do I I know he thinks that I hate him,

523
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,280
but I don't um so We will cut that we will we will cut that part out.

524
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:19,100
We'll let me So I I don't and I think this is a funny question for me too because

525
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,520
I don't think I have the biggest account Or anywhere close to it, right?

526
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,660
So i'm trading with like fifty thousand dollars, right?

527
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,540
So i'm i'm sure that there's guys in here with 100 150 200 thousand dollars,

528
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:30,760
right?

529
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,460
I I i'm pretty confident of that actually So so i'm i'm speaking from a practitioner

530
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,300
standpoint on this like i'm growing a smaller account too, right?

531
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,860
um So I think that the biggest thing so first of all, I would say, uh,

532
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,340
literally trade paper and then Trade paper work out your edge, right?

533
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,380
Start to understand it While you do that understand that paper trading the fills

534
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,780
are really really easy Okay,

535
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,420
so I was taking everything under the sun on a paper account and I like just like

536
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,460
blew it blew,

537
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,540
you know Like I I mean I was killing it right and it was because all my fills were

538
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,740
cream Like it was it was super easy, right?

539
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,800
And then I went to live and I had a had a tough time, right?

540
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,680
and I said there was a there was a learning transition there,

541
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,220
so I'll say that with a caveat but but trade paper first, right?

542
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,640
when you when you're in a small account to work out your edge and I say that I want

543
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:34,290
to start with that because um because I think That most everybody in this group

544
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:40,270
maybe with the exception of a few is like under 35 I would say like under 35 under

545
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,130
40. I don't think we have too many people older than that Maybe i'm wrong,

546
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,630
but I think I think that mostly it's a younger crowd.

547
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:53,270
So what you're Somebody said I'd be old We have steve b here isn't steve b like

548
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,670
50 something dude,

549
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:01,800
he sounds like it for sure You're talking about bonds today Uh, no,

550
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,960
I mean i'm not i'm not alienating i'm not alienating older older people but but

551
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,120
the reason why I say that a majority of the people being younger is because Is because

552
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,740
like i'm sure that they have other areas of their financial life that they want

553
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,980
to put money to right?

554
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,040
Buy a house buy a car Uh fund a retirement account uh buy some long-term indexes

555
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,920
in and and uh And pay down debts pay on student loans like you're talking about

556
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,660
like a multi-faceted so looking just looking at it from like a a personal financial

557
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,580
standpoint You're got you've got to look at your trading account and say hey,

558
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,740
how much do I want to put into this trading account? right and so um,

559
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,130
and so you got it,

560
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:49,430
so I would say like Understanding your edge is really important because like for

561
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:59,760
me right now from where for where i'm at with my edge and um and understanding How

562
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,920
well i'm doing and why i'm doing well and everything I'm,

563
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,180
like i'm like trying to find money under the couch cushions right to put into my

564
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:13,440
trading account So I think I think a difficulty for someone who's growing an account

565
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:20,100
Is convincing yourself that putting money into the account is going to be a worthwhile

566
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,500
investment Right.

567
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,060
So an investment up here that you're learning a new strategy of making money,

568
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,700
right? Um, and also like a financial, uh incident, right?

569
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,460
So so you got to convince yourself that it's a good idea to put money into this

570
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,000
account before you start Not contributing to your 401k to put money into your retirement

571
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,500
account, right? Like you have to convince yourself.

572
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,510
It's a good idea um Secondly,

573
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:56,150
I would say I mean I would I would lean back on I would lean back on um Daniel yeah

574
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,110
Yes,

575
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,910
I that was that's funny because that's an example of something that I did recently

576
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,110
and he's reaming me about it I stopped putting money into my 401k.

577
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:14,170
Um uh to put more into my trading account, um, so So yeah, I mean Is that good?

578
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,930
Is that I feel like I answered the question. Is that? Yeah Dude,

579
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,310
I think that's that's great. And uh, you know, you know,

580
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,610
you're doing well when you want to add money into your account, right?

581
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,690
You know a lot of times we have traders say like how much should I start with?

582
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,290
you know,

583
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:33,080
like i'm only gonna put in five thousand dollars and it's like It's kind of like,

584
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,620
you know,

585
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,820
you're going to the casino with five thousand dollars knowing you're gonna lose

586
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,120
it, right?

587
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,980
You know start off understanding your business like and then you know as you get

588
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,420
better and better You want to start allocating capital towards it, right?

589
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,420
Like any good any good business? Yeah No, I I'll piggyback off of that too.

590
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,660
Like figure out like it's not bad to start with five thousand dollars But or a small

591
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,500
amount whatever the relative small amount is, right?

592
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,680
it's not bad to start with a small amount but like Learn your learn your strategy

593
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,480
and understand if that's a lot or a little Right.

594
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,740
So like like you said like somebody trying to sell naked on earnings You can't do

595
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,120
that with under ten thousand dollar account.

596
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,720
You just can't do it It doesn't make sense, right?

597
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,560
You're gonna have to put your whole account on every single trade and so learn but

598
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,200
if you're gonna buy If you're gonna so Sean did a live on buying flies right out

599
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,000
of money flies with like a with like a $3,500 account, right?

600
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,900
So like those out of the money flies if you're buying for a hundred two hundred

601
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,220
whatever,

602
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,740
you know 50 bucks here flies here and that's the strategy that you really like and

603
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,060
you start to understand it Great that you can start with a smaller account on that.

604
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,740
So understand the structure that you're trading understand margin Understand the

605
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,920
business before you understand how much you're gonna put into it And then I would

606
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,160
just say like learn right learn what good trading is learn betting strategies learn

607
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,800
statistics Listen to these guys every single night and and then build,

608
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,440

to that point was like screaming in my head like this is a huge opportunity,

612
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,840
right?

613
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,340
and we smashed it right and so But that was only because I learned up until that

614
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,720
point and I built confidence and I put and I put money into the account I was ready

615
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,600

I mean listen to that though like the dude has so much confidence in his craft Right

623
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,700
like people people say all the time Like okay,

624
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,340
so so what so what does Warren Buffett do and this is like totally different,

625
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,520
right?

626
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,860
Warren Buffett is not nowhere close to what we do But like what does Warren Buffett

627
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,940
do when he can't find a good investment?

628
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:12,120
He buys shares in his own company Because he knows that he's confident in his portfolio

629
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,660
And Berkshire Hathaway is going to perform over the long run, right?

630
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,980
And so where if I come into some cash right from whatever is going on businesses

631
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,120
return on investment, whatever If I come into some cash,

632
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,760
what what's the first thing that comes on my trading account?

633
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:32,040
That's where my confidence is, right? Um, so yeah, so anyways, oh, yeah,

634
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,720
man um So hutch rolling off of that Yeah What I know you're a cowboy, right?

635
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,560
I know you're a cowboy but Besides that hutch What do you think makes you different

636
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,920
than all most of the traders out there, right?

637
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,360
Like you you know the rule 99 people lose money and I I don't think it's that bad

638
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,060
But when it comes to like actually trading an option,

639
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,500
it's probably extremely high like I'd say plus 90% of people in the long run Are

640
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,160
gonna lose money What do you think?

641
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,540
What makes you different than all these people out there?

642
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:14,040
so um I think that my edge personally And I've taken some time to think about this

643
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,300
like because I've thought about this before before you're even asking me um Because

644
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,780
there's a freaking ton of smart people in this group And I know that this group

645
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,120
is a very small fraction of the competition that's out there, right?

646
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,140
so like So like it can't just be data. A lot of people have data, right?

647
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,740
It can't just be like execution because i'm fucking using tos.

648
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,520
I don't have a bloomberg, right? You know what? I mean, you know, you know,

649
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,180
there's there's people out there that have a lot more tools than I do, right?

650
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:51,410
so um I think that my I think that and i'm not saying that this puts me above All

651
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,250
the traders out there.

652
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,630
I think that it gives me I think that it keeps me going keeps me in the game I think

653
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:02,290
I think my advantage here is the ability to get up off the dirt and keep trading

654
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,640
Um,

655
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,040
so you're in a you're in a drawdown and I shake it off and I make another trade

656
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,180
So I have i've been in conversations with guys Working out grinding out earning

657
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,040
strategies when we're talking about different pieces of the puzzle and we take a

658
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:25,160
We take one on the chin right And then and then the person i'm talking to or whoever

659
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,700
that we're i'm gaming this strategy out with They're like, oh dude.

660
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,720
I need to sit one out, right? Well,

661
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,340
here's the thing your back test that told you that this was a profitable strategy.

662
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,620
It didn't sit one out Right that back test didn't sit one out.

663
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,660
It took the next trade So you need to you need to make sure that your position sizing

664
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,260
is right So that when you take one on the chin that you're still in the game Okay,

665
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,580
so that's important, right?

666
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,920
You need to make sure that the money is still there, right?

667
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,760
And then also you need to make sure that you can get over your bias of loss aversion

668
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,620
and and get up off the dirt and and and and uh And and make and make the trade make

669
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,780
the next trade There's been so many times when I took one on the chin I saw somebody

670
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,380
sit out the next one and i'm like, hey, dude, there's a trade here.

671
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,280
Let's do it It's even better than the one yesterday.

672
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,120
Like we it was a positive expected value yesterday It's it's a positive expected

673
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,220
value today and i'm taking it and they're sitting out and I make back my loss Right,

674
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,740
like your your back test doesn't sit out it trades no matter what It doesn't have

675
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,840
loss aversion, right?

676
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:37,740
And so to make sure that your real life trading Matches your back test of what told

677
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,220
you was profitable. You have to keep going, right? I think it comes back.

678
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,320
I growing up.

679
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,080
I played baseball and so like that was I played other sports But like that was my

680
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,520
sport, uh, and I was a pitcher and my dad always told me next pitch, right?

681
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,260
You throw a bad one next pitch, right?

682
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,540
You can't the the last pitch is already gone. You gotta throw the next one,

683
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,060
right?

684
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,780
And so I think that just that was ingrained in me I think I know a lot of I know

685
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,420
a lot of Guys have sports backgrounds and girls too girls have sports backgrounds.

686
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,080
It gives them a competitive edge, right?

687
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,140
It gives them like a mindset that they can bring to trading and business and all

688
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,220
those things, right? um, so I would yeah,

689
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,520
I would just say I would say next pitch like just move on. Let's you know,

690
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,280
get the next one Very nice. Very nice. Uh,

691
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,400
i've got two last questions for you here, buddy Okay, so one is if you uh,

692
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,840
if you want Can you maybe disclose some of um?

693
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,080
uh your uh Pre-releases or what that what that means to you and also would you say

694
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,380
that is the biggest?

695
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,300
uh One of the biggest uh things that you found or you know,

696
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:51,380
maybe you can try a little bit more about strategy Pre-releases is proprietary No,

697
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,100
i'm kidding, uh, what'd you say sean Spoken like a good trader. Yeah,

698
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,620
that's right.

699
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,180
That's right You don't need to give any secret sauce where you can say,

700
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:07,240
uh that uh, your firm cannot uh The earnings boys, uh choose to not comment.

701
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,720
No, i'm kidding. I'm definitely gonna uh, Uh, yeah,

702
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,800
daniel daniel and marjorie and steve are gonna be mad at me. Uh,

703
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,400
but it's okay Uh pre-releases. So yeah, so that's dude.

704
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,420
That's a huge Huge edge you gotta have time right?

705
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,120
So jordan when you when you revealed it to us So I will say too.

706
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,640
I did not find pre-releases jordan told me about it, but I spent some time,

707
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,840
you know Refining it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah making it better, right?

708
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,080
So we and we take yeah And now jordan expects us to give us give him the releases

709
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,860
since he came up with the strategy, right? uh, but yeah,

710
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:48,940
so pre-releases If anybody was paying attention this quarter, um, uh,

711
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,960
a lot of retail companies pre-released Uh,

712
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,180
that's because of covid obviously retail took it on the chin because of covid and

713
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:03,820
a lot of them were then they were reporting their 4q year-end Stuff right their

714
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,000
numbers for the whole year of 2020 Right.

715
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,920
So a lot of them pre-released So that they didn't get smashed, right?

716
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:17,710
So basically what I did is I went through the tickers and this takes a fuck ton

717
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,570
of time, right? So I went through the tickers Um,

718
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:25,350
and when we found out that retail was kind of the sector doing it then I was looking

719
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:29,580
at all the retail ones, right? Margin does this too, right?

720
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,800
We spend a lot of time doing this We look and see if there's any sort of press release

721
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,140
That would insinuate a pre-release so so, uh,

722
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:46,460
the the words that you're looking for are business update or Sometimes it's sales

723
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,400
update, but you have to be careful with sales updates.

724
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,980
Sometimes companies do sales updates all the time So if a company always does a

725
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,860
sales update, it's not an edge, right?

726
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,540
It's always there market's expecting it um the ones that you're really loving are

727
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,420
Preliminary results, right? If you see preliminary results,

728
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,420
like i'm reading that whole press release like i'm looking at it In detail i'm going

729
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,000
back. I also like to go back two to three years predominantly three Um,

730
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,220
and if the investor relations page allows me to so also I don't go on yahoo finance

731
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,560
Or google or anything like that i'm going to i'm literally googling I'm,

732
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,180
i'm googling cole's investor relations.

733
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,200
I'm going to the investor relations page.

734
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,080
I'm looking at their actual pre-release I'm bringing up the pdf that's posted online

735
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:39,060
on their website and i'm reading it. Okay um I look to see if they do this,

736
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,860
right if they do pre-releases ever A lot of these retail companies they did they've

737
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:47,120
never done one Then they did one right when covet happened then they did one for

738
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,160
the year-end results, right?

739
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:53,240
And so the theory behind pre-releases is they will typically do it a month to two

740
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,400
months before their earnings report Okay,

741
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,700
and so when that happens the market is going to price in what the numbers are Okay,

742
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:01,640
um,

743
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,460
and so you're going to be they're going to the market's going to price in uh,

744
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,900
what the numbers are I see neil's question.

745
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,840
I'll go ahead and go ahead and hit it what i'm looking for in these pre-releases

746
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,500
is Is that they hit a lot of the numbers?

747
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,080
that They are going to talk about if they give earnings per share if they give sales

748
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,340
And revenue if they get give net sales if they give depending on the company like

749
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:33,280
capex expenditures Whatever right if they give any sort of forecast, right?

750
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,880
And a lot of these so one thing that uh,

751
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,940
one thing that american eagle didn't realize so we did american eagle I think everybody

752
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,720
pretty much got out unscathed on that,

753
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,880
but it didn't end up being a very profitable trade And they pre-released was because

754
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,540
they didn't put their e-commerce sales In the pre-release and we're pretty sure

755
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,880
that the e-commerce sales because they grew was what blew it out, right?

756
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:02,200
So so i'm looking for a holistic Report of the numbers.

757
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,680
It doesn't have to be like,

758
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,320
oh if they didn't do earnings per share then i don't take it, right?

759
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,740
It's not that like minute But um, i'm looking for a i'm looking for uh,

760
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,360
like I I want them to give a full report, right?

761
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,350
If they just give sales It's not that much of an edge right like people probably

762
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:23,990
had a pretty good idea of sales anyways So then what the what happens the mechanics

763
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,250
of it is the market prices it in a month to two months before the event And then

764
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:33,450
and then we also want to see So this is a thing for anybody listening to me.

765
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,450
That's like a new new person here Then you're thinking okay,

766
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,030
okay like your mindset, okay,

767
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,010
if I see a pre-release i'm selling vol that's not true, right?

768
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:45,910
So if I see a pre-release and then I also want a build up in the implied move and

769
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,850
the event vol going up To it as well.

770
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:52,030
Sometimes the market will overlook these things because it's hard to find them,

771
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:52,570
right?

772
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:57,010
So the company will give it give give the market the numbers and the numbers are

773
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,350
relatively known And so the numbers are going to be reflected in the analyst reports

774
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:01,810
Okay,

775
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,950
so the data that's out there on the company is going to be is going to be there,

776
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,110
right? And then the market overlooks that fact, right and they're like,

777
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,630
okay Uh coles is going to report earnings What do we think it's going to be and

778
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,430
the analysts are like it's going to be this this and this because they already know

779
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,010
Right.

780
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:24,670
It was in the pre-release And so then the market builds up this event vol into the

781
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:29,670
into the security into the term structure We sell the shit out of it, right?

782
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:33,930
Because because the numbers are going to be exactly what the analysts are saying

783
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,130
or close to it, right? There's a risk there, right?

784
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,810
There's a risk that there was like a quarter Or whatever,

785
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,230
you know a month or whatever that they those numbers changed and it was different

786
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,030
or whatever But um, i'm not saying this these are without risk,

787
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:51,010
but the risk is muted Uh because of our confidence in the numbers that they're about

788
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:57,010
to report. Um, so, uh, so yeah Does that is that is that a good explanation,

789
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,970
okay Yeah, I think that's really good.

790
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,870
And I I I know we're we're running out of time here I just want to say something

791
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,230
super important that hutch. Um,

792
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,130
Mentioned there was kind of like a read between the lines kind of thing if you were

793
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,350
paying attention And it's probably the most important thing that is that is going

794
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,490
to come out of this. Uh,

795
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,900
uh this live in my opinion What hutch said about american eagle there,

796
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,440
so I really want if you guys could pay attention to this.

797
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:26,030
This is super important hutch took a bet on american eagle And it wasn't the greatest

798
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,190
trade right, you know, he made a little money Maybe he lost a little money,

799
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:34,220
but he didn't just go on to the next trade He sat there and said what went wrong?

800
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:39,470
And he looked into it and he realized that they didn't give the e-commerce number

801
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:43,890
and now he's going to take that idea And move it forward and all of a sudden his

802
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,240
business just got better Right,

803
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,480
and that is the most important thing in my opinion when you want to become profitable

804
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,580
trader It's not that you know,

805
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,380
you saw a breakout and he said oh you go back and then there's like kind of like

806
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,040
Wishy-washy kind of hindsight bias thing going on.

807
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,060
It's like no This is what happened and I realized that okay This is actually important

808
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,200
for this company and now I can take those ideas And move it forward and all of a

809
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,680
sudden his business just got better and I think that is so important That you mentioned

810
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,640
that hutch Yeah, uh shout out to margin. He found that uh,

811
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,000
but we talked about it. Yeah We built it forward, right? Yeah, so so Yeah,

812
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,660
more more more more a pub on the team, right? Uh,

813
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,660
but if we're running out of time,

814
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,160
I want to do we have time for some for these questions here?

815
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,320
I I got some guys that messaged me some questions. Let's do um, okay Okay,

816
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,500
cool Sean you want to open up? I think we're good for time. If uh,

817
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,420
if you want to uh,

818
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,960
one more question jordan I was just gonna ask a super quick question about uh,

819
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,820
some of your um, uh,

820
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,200
The other sources that you've learned from because obviously,

821
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,880
you know besides pa But maybe if you can just post you know If we're a rush for

822
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,340
time right now,

823
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,600
maybe you can just post in a group some of the best sources that i've taught you

824
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:04,410
Yeah Uh, I don't have a lot of resources for for that. I mean, um,

825
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:09,690
I I think dude I think that I think that everything that you guys have put forward

826
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:15,510
in the uh, I I went back and read laws of trading by gustin again Um,

827
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,190
I got it on audiobook this time. Um, dude,

828
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:22,750
that's a incredible book Right when you're talking about business when you're talking

829
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,950
about building trading as a business, dude,

830
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:29,750
he talks about uh Uh tech debt soft like coding debt.

831
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:33,010
He talks about transaction costs. He talks about dude.

832
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,490
He talks about everything in that book Freaking incredible book.

833
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:41,010
I I it's it's really gonna I think that you guys have a lot of great resources here

834
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:45,590
I mean and just like I mean going down the youtube hole of eun sinclair, right?

835
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,630
Like going like,

836
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:51,570
you know getting these names they already have like a like a a stamp of approval,

837
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,250
right? And just just just dig deeper, right?

838
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:57,590
Just be curious about those things and then you know,

839
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:01,670
this is cheating this is cheating because I found these guys through pa but like

840
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,850
There there are there are fucking smart guys in this group like really smart guys

841

848
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,110
but you know all those are the guys that I talk to a lot What's that?

849
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,490

00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:49,830
pranav pranav will be smart when he gets into his teenage years. Yeah Yeah,

851
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,810
so anyway, so okay i'm gonna i'm gonna hit these questions real quick Yeah,

852
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,510
that's what I told these guys how to answer them Um,

853
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:00,450
if anyone else on the live right now has questions drop them in the chat.

854
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,100
We'll get to them as well Yeah,

855
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:06,640
so marcos wanted to know Metrics and criteria for selecting trades.

856
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:11,460
I think I pretty well hit that right like Like all that I went over it at the beginning

857
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,640
So marcos if you didn't see that you're still recording right sean? Yep.

858
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,480
We're good. Yeah Okay,

859
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,420
so I went over that at the beginning So if you didn't catch it go, uh,

860
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,840
I went through pretty much every single step that I go through Um,

861
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,560
and that's what that was like a lot of these questions So it's kind of just metrics

862
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,600
and criteria I do want to i'll circle back to that criteria and then i'll hit this

863
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,500
one question by arnold. Um,

864
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,300
He said I see sometimes your summary of trades and you take trades that don't have

865
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,540
a lot of volume The reason I don't take those is because i'm scared that the spread

866
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,200
will be too big and i'll be stuck in that position Uh, so it's a good point.

867
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,120
Um, so when i'm looking at liquidity, okay,

868
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:50,480
so liquidity is a bigger topic I'm looking at volume and i'm looking at spread Okay,

869
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,200
so those are different, right?

870
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,560
One one leads into the other sometimes if it's low volume,

871
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,300
there will be wide spreads, right? That's isn't always the case though.

872
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,980
So you need to look at both of them. Okay,

873
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,120
sometimes there's a lot of There's a lot of volume,

874
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,860
but the spread is still kind of wide, right?

875
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:13,780
So be careful there I don't avoid wide spreads. I know that Sean,

876
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,720
it's probably going to hit me with a wet noodle after this,

877
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:21,120
but I don't avoid wide spreads I also I don't sort Um,

878
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,280
I don't sort based on total option volume.

879
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,100
I go to the chain So a lot of guys a lot of guys when they're looking for earnings

880
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:36,320
trades They will sort in the terminal for total options volume And they'll say anything

881
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,960
below this i'm not even looking at it I look at those and then I go to the chain

882
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,400
and I see that at the money actual volume in my brokerage Okay,

883
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,900
so and then I size out the position I say,

884
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:53,160
okay How big am I going to get into this position based on my risk tolerances?

885
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,800
And then I see what percentage of the volume that i'm going to be If i'm going to

886
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,260
sell like three or four contracts and there was a hundred traded i'm good i'm fine

887
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,900
I feel comfortable with that, right?

888
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,760
But I also have a year under my under my belt of fill execution and earning straights,

889
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,940
right? So if you're not comfortable with that then,

890
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,220
you know stick to the higher volume, uh, but I like I told jordan. Um,

891
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:21,400
Like I told jordan Uh, I like to I like to play in that middle market.

892
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,880
I'm not selling vol on nike I'm not selling vol on fedex.

893
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,300
Those were two that happened today, right?

894
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,380
That's just something that I've found that like a lot of people are watching those

895
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,000
names And I just don't feel like I have an advantage there So i'm gonna play in

896
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,980
those middle market go look at the tickers that i'm selling, right?

897
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,780
Some of those companies you don't know the tickers off the top of your head And

898
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,780
I went and looked at the volume and they were fine and I got out of it just fine

899
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:48,340
That's another reason that I don't take wings is because I don't want to fool with

900
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,040
wing wing liquidity That's hard to say wing liquidity.

901
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,460
I I don't want to fool with it. So I sell that the money, right?

902
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,760
So that I can get out better. Um, so Uh,

903
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:02,160
I I I understand where my edge is and and where I want to play and in the market

904
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,660
I found myself like a little niche and then I built everything around it to to to

905
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,540
capitalize on it. So Uh, we got some uh, cool words coming out of this.

906
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:14,900
Uh podcast. Hey, we got uh, Meek, we got wiggly. Um,

907
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:19,030
i'm surprised to see what else is going to be coming out of here Yeah,

908
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,850
I brought the bottle my whiskey bottle over here so that I could keep filling right

909
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:28,330
as I talk Yeah I thought you were grabbing your nose there. Yeah. No, no. No,

910
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:32,070
it's a bottle. Yeah, it's a bottle Uh,

911
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,890
so what does your research process look like that was from braun braun,

912
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:39,350
I think I saw braun uh chat Do do I feel like I I answered that?

913
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:44,550
dude You drop drop something in here if I if I answered that I feel like I did I

914
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:48,450
think for sure Went in pretty much quite a lot of detail there. Okay. Okay. Uh,

915
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,770
yeah. Okay. You got already. Okay good. Uh,

916
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:55,790
so Can you automate any of this this is another one of braun's questions can you

917
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,510
automate any of this man I would like to um It's kind of like those guys that like

918
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,590
the manual process of their coffee in the morning,

919
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,530
right the pour over like I like You know,

920
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,250
I like the process of going through it really feeling out the market.

921
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:13,610
I have I have learned a lot in the manual process Me and daniel have kicked back

922
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,250
and forth daniel has worked on it.

923
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:20,650
I have not about uh Sorting these tickers and then being able to kind of port them

924
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:25,410
over to the terminal to see what's in the terminal what's not because um Because

925
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,830
not to point out the terminal's weaknesses,

926
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,130
but the earnings date feature does it doesn't work very well, right?

927
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:37,690
So what I do is I go to a website called earnings whispers And I just go down the

928
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:38,050
calendar.

929
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,850
It's never failed me Maybe I missed something and I don't know it's failed me,

930
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,330
but it's never failed me on earning states I think it's a great.

931
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,490
I think it's a great resource. So that's what I use there. Um,

932
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,170
And practically none of this is automated for me. It's all manual.

933
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:58,420
Um What are your plans for upcoming lull and earnings a lot of whiskey i'm gonna

934
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,480
be drinking a lot Um, no, I mean it seriously though. I uh,

935
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:09,350
I take time during earning seasons to um I take time during earnings scenes to read

936
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,030
uh to process I you know,

937
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:17,680
try to do one-to-ones with jordan talk through things um Uh,

938
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:23,460
just to process to a new edge new strategy Um, you know,

939
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,640
I do other things right more one-off type trades or whatever. So, um, Yeah,

940
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,940
so I I do other things I see a pranav made an appearance. Thanks, dude,

941
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,980
like right at the end here not listening to anything Uh popped in a really really

942
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:46,120
funny question, so it's all good How old are you? Uh, do you uh Yeah, yeah,

943
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:52,580
do you do you play lead up to event braun? I don't man. Um, uh,

944
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,940
jordan used to have a Feature,

945
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,380
what did you call that jordan the lead up vol like what the vol of the forecast

946
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,800
vol? Yeah Yeah, so the forecast of earnings vol we used to have that feature.

947
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,340
Um, I I personally didn't love it. Daniel loved it. Um,

948
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,680
he liked to he liked to fool around with it and everything Um,

949
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,380
I I don't I really don't play lead up and vol I like the event.

950
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,720
I like the rush Right. I like to be in and out in a day. Um,

951
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:23,000
Uh percent wins and losses I hit this earlier Um, but yeah,

952
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,780
I think this season so my long vol was about 70 percent win rate Uh short vol was

953
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,980
about 80 percent win rate. I think that is high.

954
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:35,800
I think short vol win rate's going to come down um So and maybe i'm just scared

955
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,600
about the mac truck that's coming my way right the five standard deviation move,

956
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:45,820
uh, It's fine. I mean it'll happen right? It'll be a bad day. But uh, but I uh,

957
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:53,240
I know that um I know that Uh,

958
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:58,680
I know that I am capitalizing on risk ignition And if anybody doesn't know that

959
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,360
term read aaron brown's book red blooded risk Uh, jordan recommended it to me.

960
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,000
It's a fantastic book risk ignition is all about capitalizing on your risk Knowing

961
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,200
when the risk is going to happen right knowing when the bad thing is going to happen

962
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,680
But makes you sure when it goes good that you're capitalizing on it Um,

963
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:20,360
so that's what that's all about. Um, Anything else in the chat?

964
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,200
I think I hit all these Yeah, there's a couple here. Just give me one second.

965
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:29,050
Okay. Um, man. I love this man. This has been great so far Yeah, dude.

966
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:34,260
I've had fun So red's just uh asking how are you checking to see a stock's biggest

967
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,180
historical move And is that only for earnings dates? Yes. Yeah,

968
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:44,240
so earn it biggest earnings move big biggest earnings move ever, right?

969
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,920
So I am i'm going it's in the it's in the terminal.

970
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,480
So you go to the earnings tab bottom, right? it's a uh,

971
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,960
it's like a um bar chart of uh, Uh bar chart down in the bottom, right?

972
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,340
Um and uh, And uh, yeah,

973
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:05,880
just just like hover over the bars with the standard deviation moves Right,

974
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,520
and you'll find the biggest the biggest move ever You can also go into the moves

975
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,240
tab and just hover over them and figure out what the percent move was there You

976
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,800
can find it just there just to add to that reds. We look at the last 16 Uh,

977
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:22,020
so it's not like forever and ever but the thing is it's like we want to be stay

978
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,640
relevant, right?

979
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,900
Something that happened six years ago to a company or during the financial crisis

980
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,460
of the company. It's not really relevant today So that's uh,

981
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,020
I just want to point that out Yeah, red you're right.

982
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,000
It it does only go a couple years back.

983
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,400
That's what jordan was just saying Yeah,

984
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,420
so we want to make sure that we're we're relevant to what the company the company's

985
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,200
doing Oh, so, I mean if you want to go farther back and and scrape that data,

986
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:47,160
you know, I wouldn't fault you for it You know, I would just yeah, uh,

987
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,660
I I yeah, but that's that's what we look at.

988
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,780
It's been successful It's more than two years, right? Uh, three or four, uh,

989
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,160
three or four.

990
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,840
No greg just saying you only look two years back That's about three or four in the

991
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,280
terminal there.

992
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:05,140
So we got another one from trent Said when looking at historical moves for earnings

993
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:09,480
Do you weigh in the more recent events more than the further dated one?

994
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:13,320
We'll assume within the information you can see in the terminal If so,

995
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,860
how much more do you weight them? Yeah No,

996
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I don't because I know that jordan has filtered out the last few years Um,

997
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,580
I know that he's filtered out the last few years And so I take all of that into

998
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,060
account, right? If I was looking at 10 years of data, i'd probably do that,

999
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,440
right? I'd probably be like, okay.

1000
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,280
Well this happened 10 years ago What's happened in the last two years,

1001
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,000
but we have pretty relevant data, right? Um,

1002
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:45,590
and so I just I keep it to that Pranav said hutch be honest with us.

1003
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,470
Do you take a shot of whiskey before each trade? Uh,

1004
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:57,430
I do not um Usually at work So I don't I don't do that It's a good idea My wife

1005
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,130
my wife,

1006
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,730
did you hear my wife in the background she goes but it's a good idea You should

1007
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:06,550
probably do that I think when we heard hutch's daughter saying daddy daddy.

1008
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:13,070
I think she was coming over with a bottle of whiskey to yeah Yeah, yeah,

1009
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:17,390
yeah Do we have any questions guys?

1010
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:27,990
Super insightful lives Neil pnl members have any questions This guy don't be shy

1011
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:32,970
Hutch is uh, hutch is a nice guy Yeah, dude,

1012
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,610
except for if you're pranav Exactly, right?

1013
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:41,650
Uh marco said how long do you take to investigate each trade? Yeah. Yeah,

1014
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:50,050
that's a good question so um So during earning season any pretty much any time that

1015
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:55,890
i'm not working during the day i'm working on I'm working on uh earnings,

1016
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:56,590
right?

1017
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:00,430
Like i'm i'm working on i'm working on sorting through companies thinking about

1018
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,690
things Um,

1019
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:08,050
so I mean I I spend I spend a lot of the day um Doing that uh for each trade specifically

1020
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:10,890
it depends on the trade, right? If it's just a normal earnings trade,

1021
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:16,750
man It it it only takes me five to ten minutes to go through the that ticker right

1022
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:21,430
and kind of think about it If and if it like if I totally sort it out in the first

1023
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:24,370
couple like filters or whatever Then I move on it takes me like 30 seconds,

1024
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:25,410
right? um,

1025
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:29,010
but you know if it's something that takes takes time to think about it,

1026
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:35,110
you know five ten minutes and then I I really sort it out and then so So I also

1027
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,950
work with a couple other guys too.

1028
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:39,250
They're looking at the same data that I am right?

1029
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,950
And so i'll post a list right i'll be like hey,

1030
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:46,830
these are the things that I like I kind of feel like weren't Talking about right?

1031
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:50,910
Um, so I work with my team these guys that I think are really really smart,

1032
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:55,330
right? Um, and we talk about the tickers and hey, I didn't like that one Hey,

1033
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,650
I didn't see that one, right?

1034
01:09:56,670 --> 01:10:00,330
and so we go kind of go back and forth that takes 20 or 30 minutes and then You

1035
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:00,530
know,

1036
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:04,790
and then we start talking about structures that takes a little bit structures takes

1037
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,170
a take a long time, right?

1038
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:08,490
You want to make sure you're covering the move you want to make sure that you're

1039
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:11,950
selling good vol You want to make sure the chain is right with the data and i'm

1040
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,430
verifying things at that point, right? So,

1041
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:18,230
I mean sometime but it depends on the trade for pre-releases Dude,

1042
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:22,790
so much time i'm reading i'm reading news releases I'm going through the investor

1043
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:27,910
relations page making sure that they've never released before If I go two years

1044
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:31,050
back and they have a release that looks like a pre-release i'm reading it It's probably

1045
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:36,610
two to three pages of business jargon Which is in a ton right? But um,

1046
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:38,910
if you do that two or three times a day, right?

1047
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,490
It takes a little bit of time So pre-releases take they take time, dude.

1048
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:47,510
I i've spent For that coles trade like to build the conviction Uh,

1049
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,850
we dude we took hours,

1050
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:53,030
you know talking about it Um building out structure making sure the vault the event

1051
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:57,070
ball was there that the market was pricing it in all that stuff Took a long time

1052
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:06,540
We got a question from uh from big dan here. Do you ever? Terminal looks good,

1053
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:11,240
but the structure slash risk stress in thinkorswim doesn't Right,

1054
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,420
so it's like the trade looks good you stress it out and you're like, uh,

1055
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:18,080
maybe not actually or uh, vice versa Yeah Jordan,

1056
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,440
do you want me to answer this? Yeah, yeah,

1057
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,980
you you you say it And i'll be i'll be the one to say like sometimes there's flaws

1058
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,560
in the data, right Let me look at you know,

1059
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,640
2 000 tickers and or 1500 tickers and you know It's especially on the less liquid

1060
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,960
names. Sometimes it could be a little bit shaky.

1061
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:42,860
Yeah So I think one one thing specifically um is uh So that was so so yes,

1062
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,080
the answer is yes Daniel asked that because he knew the answer right? Uh,

1063
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,700
and and this is important to talk about and that's why I asked it right is you need

1064
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,530
to verify your data That's a part of hammering out your edge, right?

1065
01:11:55,870 --> 01:12:00,170
Is I think this is what I think this is what it says Right.

1066
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,830
I need to go and make sure that my brokerage is saying the same thing, right?

1067
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,450
So one thing that I found,

1068
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:09,170
uh kind of uh kind of trips up our data source a little bit and jordan,

1069
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:13,210
you know I'm sure that you'll get better about this in the future. I Honestly,

1070
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:16,630
I know you will you're constantly getting better at your data. But um,

1071
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:21,290
but the term structure is a blend of tenors Okay,

1072
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,810
so the tenors is expiration dates Okay,

1073
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:30,370
so like so like if you have weeklies if you have weeklies On on a on an options

1074
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:34,870
chain and you have a you have a 1 a 8 a 15 Right,

1075
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:38,890
you have like every week you have a friday expiration Right on those tenors.

1076
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:42,190
Um his His his uh,

1077
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:46,650
his first dot right there on the term structure is going to be a blend of those

1078
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:50,150
first two or three tenors Okay,

1079
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:56,730
so so if you see a super steep Backwardization go to your go to your chain your

1080
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:00,350
options chain and make sure that you're seeing that drop of fall from the front

1081
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:03,710
week To the second week to the third week, right? um,

1082
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:06,270
so so make sure you're verifying your data, um,

1083
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:16,700
and then also um I will play around with straddles versus strangles to to make sure

1084
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:22,840
that i'm covering Both upside vault like upside move and downside move Okay,

1085
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:27,720
so sometimes you'll sell vol on something with high put skew Right,

1086
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,460
and the puts are really expensive.

1087
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,780
The calls are pretty cheap And so you're covering way more move on the downside

1088
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,620
and you're not covering anything on the top side Okay. Well,

1089
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,520
what if it rockets to the top side? You need to know that right?

1090
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,440
You need to know that you're exposed to the top side So then then i'll play around

1091
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,580
with the strangle. Maybe i'll go really far out in the calls or whatever,

1092
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:52,100
right? um, so yeah Um, so yeah, the answer is yes,

1093
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:59,600
and that's that's why Do you think your kids portfolio is outperforming neils?

1094
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,800
No, I think neil's killing it.

1095
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,880
He's not saying anything He's playing with grandma's money and he's doing earnings

1096
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,610
date arbitrage. I think he's killing it I think he's doing pretty well,

1097
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:15,250
too At least from what his grandma tells me he's doing pretty good Yeah,

1098
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:19,850
grandma grandma just renewed contract she hasn't she hasn't uh,

1099
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,230
she hasn't asked for her capital back so that's good. Yeah,

1100
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:30,090
exactly Although that that that did sound a little suspect um So I guess sean we'll

1101
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:34,330
wrap it up here I I can't believe we had 20 22 people stay all the way for an hour
