1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Yun, so actually,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,120
this is one of the questions I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,520
So I thought I'd start, kick it off with that.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,700
So you mentioned in the group that you took, you shorted some ball on SRPT.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,620
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,460
I was wondering how you structured that trade and why you structured it that way.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,300
And then maybe if you can talk a little bit about the sizing for that trade as well,

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,020
how you sized it. Okay, so yeah. Okay, so I structured that.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,920
All I had on was a short strangle in the, I can't remember the strikes,

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,020
but it was like, when I put it on, it was like 15 delta call, 15 delta put,

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,680
two weeks out.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,770
The reason I did that is because the wings in particular were really elevated.

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,790
All vol in that stock was really elevated, obviously,

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,710
because there was an announcement scheduled to come up,

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,770
but the wings were very elevated.

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:07,460
And the reason I sold strangles is because I really, okay,

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,020
so I wanna say right now, nothing I say is going to be an absolute.

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,980
You can always come up with, what about this? What about this? But in general,

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,220
I think if you're gonna sell vol, sell vol. Most of the time,

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,500
the idea of doing an iron condor to cap your losses or whatever is just a waste

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,280
of money. Those kinds of hedges are very rarely done.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,180
They're not useful in single stocks in particular. I mean,

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,900
this thing had like a 400 vol. I mean, I knew it was gonna move. I mean,

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,900
if it had gone to zero,

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,920
I wouldn't have lost much more money than I lost as it was.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,600
So it really just does come down to sizing.

27
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,290
And sizing is tricky because it could go on, I could talk about it all night.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,890
I started very much as a Kelly person.

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,080
I've evolved slightly in that regard now that I'm doing a lot more portfolio stuff.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,720
I mean, this method is based on forecasting method that I did 15 years ago.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,380
But 15 years ago, there were only about 100 stocks that traded options.

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,360
And now there's, I don't know, 5,800 or something.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,060
And I think there's 500 that have weekly options.

34
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,680
So now you can just do the breadth.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,340
So I just do tons and tons and tons of this. And I have really small positions.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,800
And I try to keep the maximum loss on each one to a certain limit. I mean,

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,540
obviously, I didn't know,

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,160
that stock could have gone up twice as much as it did.

39
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,920
So you don't know what the maximum loss is, but you can sort of,

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,540
you can eyeball it. You don't have to sort of say to yourself,

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,370
how much would I lose if the S&P went up 8,000% overnight? Could it? Yeah.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,740
But I mean, realistically, you can just throw that out, right?

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,980
So when people say, how do you know? Well, you don't know, do you?

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,820
But if you know enough to do a trade,

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,990
then you know enough to come to some sort of conclusion about that as well.

46
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,640
And if you literally can't, then you shouldn't be doing the trade,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,720
because you don't know enough to do the trade.

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Everything you need for sizing is also the same stuff you need to measure edge.

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,330
So don't tell me that you can't size something, but you think you've got edge.

50
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,970
It's the same problem. Right. Interesting. So in that case,

51
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,870
I remember when we did a GameStop trade for earnings one time,

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,990
and we were trying to stress the position. Do we stress it to a 200% move?

53
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,910
And if we do, we can barely get any size on this thing.

54
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,670
When you look at these trades that you're doing,

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,830
how are you stressing that position in let's say the SRPT trade? Okay, well,

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,060
let's do an easier one right now. Let's say you've got an earnings trade,

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,040
right? And you want to sell the front week vol, and the front week vol is 150,

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,660
and the second week vol is 80. So in this situation, I would say, okay,

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,320
I don't think 150 is the fair vol, because that's what I'm selling.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,100
So I think it's lower than that. Let's say I say, okay, it's 120.

61
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,960
It's halfway between those two,

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,280
because that's the sort of realized premium you can expect in a variance premium.

63
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,760
So then I'll say, what's a 3SD move based on that vol?

64
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,080
And I'll just cap it at that. I'll just say,

65
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,430
I could possibly lose here 3SDs if this thing moves against me. Interesting.

66
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,010
I'll do 3SDs, but I'll also lower the implied vol back to 80,

67
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,490
which doesn't make a great deal of difference on a one-day option,

68
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,050
but in a one-week option, it can.

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,120
And is there a reason why you thought in that case,

70
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,180
Gamma was expensive relative to, let's say, Vega?

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,900
Where maybe you wouldn't be so sensitive to the moves if you were, let's say,

72
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,660
selling a Jan 2022, for example?

73
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,550
Okay, now leaving aside earnings,

74
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:03,010
because obviously that's a specific timed event. Almost always,

75
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,730
the variance premium, if that's what you're trying to capture,

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,020
is larger in the short-dated options.

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,510
And it pretty much increases almost linearly and monotonically.

78
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,330
The biggest variance premium you're going to find is an option right before it expires.

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,160
So typically, if you're going to sell options,

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,140
you sell them as short as you dare. If you're going to buy them,

81
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,000
you buy long-dated options just because there's less variance premium.

82
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,460
And I also think people don't like doing that because it's going to involve selling

83
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,840
an SPY daily straddle for like 80 cents,

84
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,280
and then paying 15 bucks for a six-month option.

85
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,020
And people don't want to do that. But the price doesn't determine value, right?

86
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,060
I mean, a Ferrari costs more than a Kia, but for a reason.

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,880
People get stuck on the price because that's what they're paying.

88
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,380
And you've really got to think about the value. But also,

89
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,130
the reason there's a variance premium is because the losses are realized through

90
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,490
gamma. And the options that have gamma are short-dated options.

91
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,850
And if you think about it,

92
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,000
if you've got an option with one week to go and a vol premium of three bucks,

93
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,720
and you've got one with two, sorry, three points,

94
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,340
you've got one with two weeks to go, vol premium of three points,

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,840
the amount of dollars that the shorter-dated one is going to accrue in a week is

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,640
going to be much greater than the other one's going to get from two weeks to one

97
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,700
week. So you're accruing dollars in those shorter-dated ones,

98
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,440
hence you're taking risk, and you get paid for risk. It's a general thing.

99
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,720
People acknowledge that the variance premium is a risk premium,

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,860
but then they don't want to take any risk. And it doesn't really work that way.

101
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,080
You've got to walk towards the fire.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
In regards to that risk premium,

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,650
I know we're seeing right now with all the meme stocks,

104
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,200
like I guess some of the biggest risk premiums,

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,780
we've probably seen in a long time.

106
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,600
I know you mentioned you were trading a basket there.

107
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,500
Is that part of your basket?

108
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,140
So like basically selling a broad range of meme stock vols?

109
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,590
They pop up,

110
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,460
but I think this is actually a really big mistake that a lot of retail people make.

111
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,200
I don't know what your people are. I don't know if they're retail or whatever.

112
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,340
And I wouldn't say they're typical retail because they're on this platform anyway.

113
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:39,620
But often I get asked, how should I trade GameStop? And my response would be,

114
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,120
why do you want to trade GameStop?

115
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,660
What's so special about GameStop apart from the fact you've heard of it?

116
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,050
I mean, if it shows up as part of your normal process,

117
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,150
that it has an edge that you identify in other situations,

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,130
will you trade it exactly the same as you trade that? I mean, otherwise,

119
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,860
why do you think you have an edge in GameStop just because the vol's 400 and it's

120
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,280
gone up 300%? If you can't explain to me where that edge is coming from,

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,710
then there's thousands of other things to trade. You don't have to trade stuff.

122
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,720
Right, I think you mentioned that in your books, right?

123
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
That's the beauty of being a positional option trader is you don't always have to

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,940
have a position on.

125
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,190
Yeah, yeah,

126
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,470
and the great thing now is you can trade across thousands of underlyings.

127
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,130
The bid-ask spread is much smaller than it used to be.

128
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,290
Brokerage costs are way smaller, and it's much easier to monitor stuff now.

129
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,850
You don't even need any real software. You can just use IB, which is free.

130
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,030
And then you can just, I don't know,

131
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:49,150
do RDE links or RDT links or something to an Excel spreadsheet and do all your monitoring

132
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,180
that way. Whereas like 20 years ago, this would have been a major operation.

133
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,400
Yeah, what was it like trading back in the day? Like,

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,100
but you were a market maker, right? At Bluefin? Yeah, yeah,

135
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,050
I started as a market maker in the DAX and the Eurostops. Got it. It was,

136
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,710
you might as well be talking about,

137
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,450
the difference from then to now is probably greater than the difference from 1900

138
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,410
to then. I mean, it was just everything about the market was different.

139
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,620
Like,

140
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,750
it would take us 10 minutes to run a risk slide just to see what our risk was.

141
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,440
And we're using dot matrix printers and stuff. I mean,

142
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,660
it's just a totally different world.

143
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,040
No one could price American options in real time because it would take too long.

144
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,740
So you'd use European options prices and then just sort of wing it.

145
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,720
Like all these approximations we got taught for like how to price butterflies quickly

146
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,800
and stuff. I mean, you don't need any of that stuff now.

147
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,140
You don't even need to know what the Greeks,

148
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,960
how to calculate the Greeks anymore. I mean, it's all there for you,

149
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,680
which is why I think a lot of training courses are still hung up on that. Like,

150
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,180
this is the formula for Delta. Well, who gives a shit?

151
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,020
You should know what Delta is, but trading's not stochastic calculus.

152
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,480
You don't need to know how to derive any of these things.

153
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,860
Got it. Sean, is there any questions coming in there?

154
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:32,440
Because I think you touched on some points that Jens was asking in terms of liquidity.

155
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,300
So you said it was much less liquid back then, a lot more liquid now,

156
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,660
but would you say that there's more opportunities in less liquid markets?

157
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,520
And should, let's say,

158
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,610
a smaller retail trader be trading in less liquid markets to find maybe edges that

159
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,490
other bigger people are leaving on the table?

160
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,100
That's one of those, it depends questions,

161
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,820
because I think once something's a liquid,

162
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,500
there's a lot of reasons why it could be.

163
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,000
Sometimes there are genuine edges in the liquid markets,

164
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,300
but they're so small that the big people are literally just not even looking at

165
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,360
them. So that does happen.

166
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,410
The problem in that case, though,

167
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,810
is no matter how big you are or how small you are,

168
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,430
you still have to be able to put the trade on.

169
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,260
So if no one else is looking at you, how are you going to get into that trade?

170
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,000
If you have to pay that full bid ask getting in and out,

171
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,680
it doesn't matter what your theoretical edge is, you can't capitalize on it.

172
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,150
So sometimes there'll be edges in a liquid stuff because the big guys don't care,

173
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,550
but often things are just a liquid because no one cares and there's no edge anyway.

174
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,180
So the fact that something's a liquid on its own isn't an opportunity. I mean,

175
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,030
that's just a problem for everyone. Transaction costs are an absolute killer.

176
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,530
And I think everyone knows that intellectually,

177
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,970
but I don't think people grasp how big a problem it is.

178
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,860
I mean, apart from transaction costs,

179
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,660
you could just randomly buy or sell stuff and you'd break even.

180
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,800
It's the transaction costs that add up and because each one's so small,

181
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,480
you just don't notice each one. But at the end of the year,

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,500
if you write them all down, it's horrific.

183
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,230
Would you say,

184
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,970
is there a difference between institutional transaction costs versus retail transaction

185
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,430
costs?

186
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,090
Yeah, there is.

187
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,050
Institutions can negotiate lower rates at every step in the process.

188
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,710
They can't do much about market impact.

189
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,250
An institution's market impact is just gonna be bigger than retail traders.

190
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,930
But all the other things like ticket charges and clearing costs can be negotiated.

191
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,510
And there's also ways that they can become like a pro customer versus a customer.

192
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,190
They can route things to different exchanges which give them better rebates and

193
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,450
stuff like that. So they have some advantages in that regard,

194
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,850
but they also have the actual market impact,

195
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,050
which is probably a bigger issue for them at that point. Well, it is. Yeah,

196
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,050
my friend who works at a pension plan, he's saying like, you take huge cuts.

197
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,050
Like when they call up a sell-side bank or something and say, hey,

198
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,350
I need to get into XYZ,

199
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,610
they'll like take huge cuts off the table there for the market impact.

200
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,440
So I can imagine a lot different. Yeah, and I mean, so obviously,

201
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,220
that's why a lot of option strategies just won't scale.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,600
Because when I say I can trade options on 500 stocks, I can,

203
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,240
but if I had a hundred million bucks,

204
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,470
I wouldn't be getting nearly the same returns. It just doesn't scale.

205
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,100
At a certain point, it just stops. So if you're doing the S&P,

206
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,860
you can trade as big as you like, but anything other than that,

207
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,060
and you've got real scaling problems, options just really aren't,

208
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,720
in most cases, they're not that big a deal in the financial world.

209
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,980
And how big do you think the vol community is relative to let's say people using

210
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,160
options for hedging or Delta bets?

211
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,260
I don't know. I really don't know. Yeah, I couldn't even put a number on that.

212
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah, I know in the last couple of years,

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,640
the average order lot has dropped to about a third of what it was say in 2018.

214
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,040
And that's really indicative of more retail people coming in.

215
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,470
And most of that retail flow is directionally speculative and most of it's on the

216
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,720
upside. So that has changed.

217
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,480
Almost all of the large like pension funds are using options as hedges or overwrites.

218
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,780
And so they are pretty much set and forget type things.

219
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:33,360
All the sell side firms are largely hedging because they don't really have prop

220
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,560
disks like they used to now. And everyone,

221
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,460
whether they say they are or not is basically playing that market making game and

222
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,780
just trying to get the spread. But how all those things work out,

223
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,860
I really couldn't tell you.

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,340
Sean, is there any questions from the lads there?

225
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,580
There's a more general one related to how retail investors and traders should be

226
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,760
looking at the markets in general in the vol space.

227
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,080
Do you think the name of the game in the retail space should be trading risk premiums?

228
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,380
Or do you think there is genuine opportunity to find some real alpha?

229
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,730
I think I would look at it like the food pyramid.

230
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,460
I think the basis of any profitable trading operation,

231
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,140
no matter what the size is,

232
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,260
should be risk premium because they're always there to a variable degree,

233
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,840
but they're always there.

234
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,280
And they tend to be large and they tend to be there for reasons that are fairly

235
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,320
obvious and well understood. So like the variance premium,

236
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,720
largely due to insurance and risk transfer.

237
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,390
So because you can kind of rely on it,

238
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,890
that should be the thing that you kind of,

239
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,090
that's your main thing that you structure around.

240
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,370
But then there's a lot of other little things that turn up occasionally.

241
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,550
And a lot of those risk premium trades don't take a lot of monitoring or a lot of

242
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:16,850
effort.

243
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,790
So they are the sort of things you can kind of just put on and then look for other

244
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,110
stuff.

245
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,690
I think it's unrealistic to think you can make a significant amount of money just

246
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,340
with the pure alpha trades because I don't think they turn up often enough.

247
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,490
And I think when I do find something like that,

248
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,110
normally it's got a sort of a significant risk premium embedded in it,

249
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,470
but I don't find it anyway. Or no capacity. Well, that's the other thing. Yeah,

250
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,180
I mean, a lot of trades are interesting,

251
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,200
but you can hardly do them either because they don't turn up very often or because

252
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,640
when they do, they turn up really small. So, you know, like, I don't know,

253
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,640
selling vol over non-farm payrolls. Yeah, I mean, that's a great trade.

254
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,620
You can do it 12 times a year. What else are you going to do?

255
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,080
Do you have any stories, where you saw something, you were like,

256
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
there's no way this is trading for that. And, you know,

257
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,160
you ended up putting it on and it worked great. Or maybe the other time,

258
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,740
where it was like, why is this here? You put it on.

259
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,200
And the next thing you know, you're on the totally wrong side of the trade.

260
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,600
Yeah, both.

261
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,880
But the one that really had the bigger P&L impact was the one that went against

262
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,360
me. Okay, so back in 1998,

263
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,420
Eurostox was a fairly young index. It had only been listed recently,

264
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,660
and they'd only just started listing futures and options on it.

265
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,860
And the Eurostox was originally envisaged as a pan-European index.

266
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,000
So they were going to have a geographical spread of companies.

267
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,560
So there were going to be some Portuguese companies and some, you know,

268
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,900
company from like, I don't know, San Marino,

269
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,480
or whatever the little countries in the EU bucket were.

270
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,820
And then after about three years,

271
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,560
they decided that they were going to completely rechange,

272
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,640
not just the weightings, they were going to change the methodology completely.

273
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,910
So it was going to literally be a different index with the same name.

274
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,040
And so they changed it to a cap-weighted index,

275
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,040
and they just chose the biggest European companies.

276
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,380
And that meant that the implied forward, I think halved,

277
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,080
because the dividend rate was totally different.

278
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,290
So I wasn't aware that they could even do that. I mean,

279
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,910
that's one of those things that when it happens to you,

280
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,650
because I had the forward on the wrong way, and like,

281
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,710
I got run over completely with it. And then two days later,

282
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,750
it was announced they were going to do it. Huh, go figure.

283
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,850
Somebody in the bank got the inside knowledge, really.

284
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,990
I didn't even know that was possible. And it's one of those things afterwards,

285
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,190
a lot of people were like, well,

286
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,310
of course you should have known that was possible. And you're like, well,

287
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,650
fuck you. It's like, back up your hard drive.

288
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,480
People only tell you that after the damn thing's crashed, right? So like,

289
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,320
Uvixy was like that a few years ago, right?

290
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,120
Where they changed the leverage factor from two and a half.

291
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,160
It's not at all clear they're allowed to even do that. I mean,

292
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,380
there's still class action lawsuits going on against that. Oh, wow. I mean,

293
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,300
but good luck, right? That is, they say, yeah, we can, we just did. All right,

294
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,850
it's up to you to litigate against it. You know,

295
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,750
so I got COVID in that one as well because I had a whole bunch of long vol.

296
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,690
It's my worst ever options loss, it was long vol.

297
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,140
So people tell you you can't lose a lot of money being a long vol,

298
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,220
they really just haven't been around long enough. Because, you know,

299
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,940
the vol dropped by, you know, from like 200 down to 150.

300
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,450
That's 50 vols worth of Vegas, not much fun. So how did you handle that swing?

301
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,280
There's nothing to come back to work the next day? Well, yeah,

302
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,600
there's nothing to handle. I just lost the money. It's gone. I mean,

303
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,440
I wasn't happy. I think I took the afternoon off. Kind of,

304
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,640
I can't remember what I did. I didn't, I wasn't happy. But yeah,

305
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,480
there's nothing you can do really, is there?

306
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,180
It's just one of those things you don't think can happen. But- Until it does.

307
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,300
Yeah, the world's, one of the reasons of,

308
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,940
one of the definitions of risk is that there's a lot more things can happen than

309
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,540
have happened.

310
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,190
So if you get,

311
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,210
if you blow up because of something that's happened in the past and you just didn't

312
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,150
pay attention to it, you're just an asshole.

313
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,550
But if you blow up for something that's never happened before, all right.

314
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,730
I mean, that's sort of forgivable.

315
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,770
Yeah, especially even like a short, since we're short vol traders, you know,

316
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,830
we always hear from the long side of people saying like, there's tail risk,

317
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,290
there's tail risk. You're always going to blow up.

318
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,390
You're eventually going to blow up. And like, in this group,

319
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,470
we're predominantly short vol. We really, I guess our foundation is from,

320
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,910
you know, how you think you,

321
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,550
and so what we usually say to those people is like,

322
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,730
that's why we're getting paid, right? It's to take on that tail risk.

323
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,590
So what's your view there in terms of thinking about how people say you're going

324
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,310
to blow up eventually because you're selling uncapped variants?

325
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,600
Well, you don't have to. I mean, it's like, okay,

326
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,720
so if you're like LJM partners who had this crazy position on where they were short,

327
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,920
I think 10 of the five Delta strangles and long one of the 30 Delta strangles,

328
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,980
right? So their P and L,

329
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
I don't even know what you'd call it.

330
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,680
The payoff diagram looked like Batman's head, right? It went like this. Okay,

331
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,500
that is just asking for trouble, right?

332
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,580
And they lost like $980 million out of a billion and they claimed it was over two

333
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,880
days. Realistically, it was over about 20 minutes. That's going to blow up,

334
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,850
but being short, you know, across 200,

335
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:43,490
like really fairly uncorrelated names with long spread in there as well.

336
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,030
I mean, you don't have to blow up. I mean, I haven't yet.

337
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,730
Maybe I'm just running through a firework factory. I don't know.

338
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,890
I don't think I am.

339
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,940
One of the other things is if you're going to have a philosophical argument about

340
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,480
this, you have to differentiate between say,

341
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,670
what happens between five Delta and five Delta because we've got enough stats in

342
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,470
that range to legitimately say, you know what?

343
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,850
There's an edge to being short vol. Not all the time, but on average.

344
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:20,220
But if you're getting out to the one Delta options, you know,

345
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,190
I would bet that they're overpriced, but I can't prove that. I mean,

346
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,350
Taleb can't prove they're not either.

347
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,810
We literally don't have enough information.

348
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,270
And so you're at the point where you have to make a lot of suppositions about things.

349
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,490
I think at that point, I don't know is a perfectly valid answer.

350
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,670
And I'm not going to go around selling one Delta options because in order to make

351
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:48,150
any money, you have to sell so many of them that your risk is enormous.

352
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,770
And frankly, your margin's enormous too. But you know,

353
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,630
I'll sell 10 Delta options all day.

354
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,480
I think there's a difference between those two. It's important difference.

355
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,950
Sean, any questions there? Yeah, there's a few actually, Jordan,

356
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,650
if you want to take a look through the chat as well,

357
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,950
but there's one that I think we should chat about.

358
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,310
It's a good time to bring it up.

359
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,750
I think it was today and maybe leading into yesterday,

360
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,530
you were having a chat in the group with some of the guys about earnings and looking

361
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:25,290
at historic moves as an indicator of future volatility. So,

362
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,430
a couple of guys just want to ask about that because one of the factors that we

363
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,150
use to, we look at when evaluating,

364
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,130
selling vol around earnings is historic moves.

365
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,830
And maybe we can split it up into a couple of different things if you think it makes

366
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,130
sense.

367
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,530
Looking at one-off moves that may have happened as an indicator for something versus

368
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,370
maybe an average move over a period of time or an average implied move over a period

369
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,470
of time, these types of historic factors.

370
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,410
What's your experience been looking into these?

371
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,460
Do you think there's any validity to looking at them and why or why not? Okay,

372
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,030
so in my first book, which was in 2008, so I guess I wrote it in like 2006,

373
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,940
I gave an example of an earnings trade where you look at say the last,

374
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,160
there's an implied move of 5% and the biggest move over the last two years was 4%.

375
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
So there's probably edge in there.

376
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,120
So I'm not saying I've never looked at these numbers either.

377
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,570
Then when I did look at them, I found that I did it in two ways, right?

378
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,270
The first one I just did was kind of a regression model where I'm like, look,

379
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,930
do these past numbers predict the future number at all?

380
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,710
Like what is the R squared from using these other things as predictors for this

381
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,500
one thing? And it was minimal. Now,

382
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,610
I think it was practically statistically zero. That could be,

383
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,670
we've only got like 12 data points for a lot of these things. And frankly,

384
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,650
that's another problem. Fundamentally,

385
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,420
companies change so quickly that most companies,

386
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,080
what they were doing three years ago isn't really what they're doing now.

387
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,450
So like there's the obvious ones like Tesla, right? Which was a startup,

388
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,050
a Bitcoin company, a car company that lost money,

389
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:20,150
a green energy credit spelling company. But like even something like GM,

390
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:27,130
things like its healthcare obligations change, its financing arm changes.

391
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,290
It's a different company.

392
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,710
I think the average lifetime of an S&P 500 company is only like 20 years.

393
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,250
So it's a really dangerous thing just to compare earnings,

394
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,470
which only come out every three months. But anyway, once I did it,

395
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,330
I just didn't find anything. And then I said, well, okay,

396
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:53,710
I'm only gonna sell options if the implied move is in a certain percentile relative

397
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,400
to the past jumps. So if it's like,

398
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:05,000
let's say the implied move is 5% and that's the 95th percentile of all the historical

399
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,280
ones. Okay, does that make sense? Well,

400
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,960
let's just say I sell it if it's above average for the jumps.

401
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,750
No matter what filter I put on and use that as a trading rule,

402
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,990
it just didn't help.

403
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,820
I'm not saying that you can't tease something out of it.

404
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,260
And there's this site that someone pointed towards some guy who does machine learning

405
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,390
on the earnings or something. I don't know,

406
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,370
maybe he's getting something out of it,

407
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:40,440
but I just know that the simple stuff that I did, it didn't do anything.

408
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,040
I've been looking at these earnings now for 15 years and I've sliced and diced them

409
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,740
in practically every way by like market cap and value and industry and historical

410
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,210
numbers. Oh,

411
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,370
and whether it comes out in the first half of the earnings cycle or the second half

412
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,870
or all of this stuff, anything I could think of, I never found anything.

413
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,100
So I just think there's an edge there in selling.

414
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:13,800
So pretty much just sell everything. Yeah, right? When in doubt, sell all.

415
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,580
I mean, for the last, this earnings cycle hasn't been very good,

416
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,400
but the last earnings cycle was fantastic.

417
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,320
So it's a very volatile way to go through life,

418
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,780
but that seems to be where all the edges.

419
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,120
So do you view it then just purely as like a risk premium play?

420
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,560
Like we'll call it like an earnings risk premium,

421
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,580
jump risk premium kind of thing? Yeah, I think so. I mean,

422
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,200
I'm not saying that if you, it's one of those things, right?

423
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,880
You could have a detailed knowledge of that particular company or that particular

424
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,810
industry. That's always possible, but I don't. I mean,

425
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,690
I've been collating this huge list of weekly options going through all the tickers

426
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,480
over the last few days. And I would say 80% of those tickers,

427
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,720
I don't know what the company does.

428
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,160
Like I didn't even know what the company was for most of them. I mean,

429
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,860
it's just three or four letters. I just, it really makes no difference to me.

430
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,910
So,

431
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,160
and I think it's also easy for people to convince themselves they know more about

432
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,670
this stuff than they really do. I mean,

433
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,090
the track record for fundamental based analysis on stocks is pretty poor.

434
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,050
It's actually unbelievable. Time and time again,

435
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,810
these like analysts we read from like the sell side research, it's like,

436
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,210
even though how much they try to understand the company,

437
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,770
they followed it for years and years, how many times they just get it wrong.

438
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,790
So, I totally agree with that. And yeah, I mean,

439
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,490
I remember when Apple was trading for 12 bucks and that was,

440
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,470
I don't know how many splits ago. And everyone said it was a terrible company.

441
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,420
It was bound to go out of business, you know?

442
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,580
And everyone thought Google was a pile of crap because it didn't make any money.

443
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,080
And everyone thought Amazon was garbage because, you know,

444
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,220
people were doing the spread where they'd buy Barnes and Noble and sell Amazon.

445
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,030
Probably didn't work out very well for them.

446
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,960
Yun, so if we were to, obviously like we could consult the data here,

447
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,470
but in your opinion, would you think that if we took,

448
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,970
let's say a company and we looked at the distribution of earnings for let's say

449
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,810
a five-year period,

450
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,410
do you think that same distribution would it be a similar distribution in the next

451
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,630
five-year period? I mean, who knows? It's only 20 data points.

452
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,560
That's one of the big problems.

453
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,480
If you could see the earnings as they accrued every day, then yeah,

454
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,140
we might be able to do a lot of stuff, but you just never have enough data.

455
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:46,470
To just sell. Vols never, it's never cheap. It's only less rich.

456
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:52,010
That's not true, but I mean, I always make sure there is a vol premium. I mean,

457
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,970
sometimes there isn't, right? Sometimes there's a, the term structure is wrong.

458
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,890
Sometimes the structure is flat. And so then I'm just not going to do anything.

459
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,910
I used to look at the dispersion of analyst forecasts,

460
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,430
on the basis that if there's a big dispersion,

461
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,000
you can't really have a surprise because no one knew what was going to happen anyway.

462
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,120
I don't know if that stopped working or if it never worked,

463
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,340
but now that I've got more information,

464
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,780
it doesn't appear to be working anymore.

465
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,770
So that was the only thing I found that ever did anything, and now it doesn't.

466
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,170
Interesting. I don't know if you have the data for it,

467
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,370
but something that was speaking to my interest is looking at the guidance data,

468
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,990
but it's just hard to get hands on good guidance data.

469
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:42,180
Even Bloomberg doesn't have it. Yeah, that's something that's changed as well.

470
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,900
There used to be smaller jumps because earnings data was leaked routinely.

471
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,680
And so people would trade on it and that would sort of take a lot of that surprise

472
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,120
away.

473
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,120
So this is one of those things where leveling the playing field has actually increased

474
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
the risk for everybody.

475
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,220
So we're talking about, I don't know when Reg FD came in, 2005 or something.

476
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,680
We're talking back in the internet bubble era.

477
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,140
And then the only person who did that after that was Steve Cohen,

478
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,900
worked out pretty well for him. Yeah, he got us too, good for him.

479
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,260
He got to buy the Mets though, that's his punishment.

480
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,260
You're not a big fan? Well, I love baseball for some reason. I don't know why,

481
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,460
because nothing ever happens, right?

482
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,980
It's one of the most boring sports on earth,

483
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,420
but it's kind of appealing as well. I just wouldn't want to buy the Mets.

484
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,680
That'd be way down the list of things I'd want to buy.

485
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,850
I know we actually briefly touched on this June,

486
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:50,400
but do you find similarities between baseball sports betting and earnings trading?

487
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,360
I think in general,

488
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,800
there are similarities between sports betting and trading in lots of ways.

489
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,580
In the way that, the sort of trades that we're talking about here.

490
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,630
I think in terms of the statistical analysis, just the general mindset.

491
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:17,650
In terms of the particular example you were giving, I don't know.

492
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,790
I don't think I've thought about it enough to know,

493
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:25,820
but I do know a couple of very successful sports gamblers who've transitioned to

494
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,320
being very successful options traders. And if you look at some of the real,

495
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,360
the OG option guys like Blair Hull, I mean, a lot of them were card counters,

496
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,460
sports gamblers. I mean,

497
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,200
he literally went from card counting to being a market maker on the Picos because

498
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,600
he thought he could make more money. That was it. I mean,

499
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,080
he thought of it exactly the same game.

500
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,460
As a card counting? Yeah, I mean,

501
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,640
he still talks about card counting when he's thinking about new ideas.

502
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,080
And one of his good friends is Bill Benter,

503
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,660
who's made several billion betting on horse races.

504
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,850
So he's done pretty well. Yeah, have you ever looked into horse racing?

505
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,050
I feel like that's actually really similar to earnings in some way.

506
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,510
There's not quite as much doping involved in earnings.

507
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:30,920
A business partner of mine in one of my previous ventures got really into it for

508
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,340
a while.

509
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,490
And he found it was very difficult because he was convinced that the races were

510
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,590
pretty much fixed in a lot of places in the US due to doping.

511
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:50,000
So, and also the rake in horse racing is ridiculous. You know,

512
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,200
I think it's like 18 to 20%. That's very tough to beat.

513
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,920
So I did a lot of baseball gambling for a while.

514
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,340
I was never interested in going into horses at all. Never.

515
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,280
I did some reading on it, but I don't think I've ever been on a horse race.

516
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,910
Got it. Yeah, the VIG's probably pretty steep over there.

517
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,020
Baseball gambling is interesting case though,

518
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,020
because of how it relates to trading.

519
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,640
Okay, so in the 80s, I'm told if you knew what ERA was,

520
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,950
and you knew how to combine,

521
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,710
if one team scores four runs and one team's expected to score three,

522
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,210
what the probability of each one winning is,

523
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,030
that was enough to make money in the 80s. When I did it,

524
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:42,690
I could just take the statistics of a player for the last three years,

525
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,550
average them, and then run a Monte Carlo simulation between two teams.

526
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:54,120
And that was, it was free money in as much as, if you,

527
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,460
the hard thing was getting the bets down. I mean,

528
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,920
I was just getting cut off from bookies.

529
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,520
And there was a 10 cent bid-ask spread then, and I was making tons of money.

530
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,820
And by the time I finished it, there was a two cent, three cent bid-ask spread,

531
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,260
and I wasn't making any money at all.

532
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,820
That market got really efficient really quickly. Wow,

533
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,220
I'm surprised they didn't go out of business. After Moneyball.

534
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,380
Once Moneyball came out, everyone started looking at the same stuff.

535
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,190
You're kidding. Hey, just one. Okay,

536
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,010
so that's actually an interesting question. Like,

537
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:31,400
do you think these publications actually really affect edges? Oh yeah,

538
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,780
absolutely. I mean, that's not, that's not an opinion.

539
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,240
That's a demonstrated fact.

540
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,760
There is such a thing called alpha publication decay.

541
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,620
When an article is published listing an edge,

542
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:53,510
the edge pretty much drops down to between 50 and 60% of what it was.

543
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,360
And that happens much more quickly now,

544
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,170
because it used to be that a paper would be written and four years later,

545
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:07,390
it would get published. Now it's on SSRN, you know, in a day.

546
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,560
So that's a very big real effect.

547
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,520
But I think people come to the wrong conclusion from it.

548
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,760
They come to the conclusion that you should never read any of these papers because

549
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,900
there's nothing in there. I mean,

550
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,980
60% of something that was really good is still really good.

551
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,600
So I don't understand that at all.

552
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,340
I think you should still read as much as you can because you get ideas from stuff.

553
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,830
I was gonna say all the time. I mean,

554
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,730
maybe one in 50 papers that I skim has a good idea in it, but it's still,

555
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,700
it's money. Right.

556
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,530
And that's actually leading into a question from one of our members here,

557
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,490
which is how do you come up with ideas? Like,

558
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,630
I think a lot of retail traders and traders in general have a hard time finding

559
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,250
new ideas.

560
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,280
So what's your process there?

561
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,430
I don't really think I have many new ideas.

562
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,450
I think it's largely a matter of learning slightly more about the stuff I've been

563
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,470
doing for a long time. So like the variance premium,

564
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,670
I've pretty much been dealing with it for 20 years.

565
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,370
And I think the way to think about it, before you even get into statistics,

566
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:29,240
right, and measuring stuff, you have to think about the phenomena, right?

567
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,070
You're not a statistician. Think of yourself more as a hunter.

568
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:41,140
You want to understand your prey. So you don't wanna sort of necessarily know,

569
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,460
if you're hunting ducks, right,

570
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,300
you don't necessarily need to know the duck's blood composition or its heartbeat,

571
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,060
but you wanna know where it feeds. You wanna know when it's gonna sleep.

572
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,160
You wanna know where it flies at certain times of the day.

573
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,900
And that's what you should do as a trader.

574
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,960
You should learn about the phenomena.

575
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,230
And then once you got the phenomena and it's a strong enough phenomena,

576
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,890
then you can start quantifying it. So I'm still learning about that phenomena.

577
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,110
I'm still like a birdwatcher who learns more about the duck every time I go and

578
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,190
look at it. So I don't think I've,

579
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,340
I think it's very hard to come up with a genuinely new idea.

580
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,040
There really aren't that many ways to skin a cat. You know,

581
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,500
sometimes you'll find a new product that has wrinkles to it.

582
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,610
Like a couple of years ago, there were all these specks, right?

583
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:35,080
Specks had a really predictable life cycle and that could be really easy to trade.

584
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:41,280
And that was speck related. So sometimes that'll happen. But like with options,

585
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,750
coming up with something really new, pretty rare.

586
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,130
I think I've maybe had two new ideas and both of them turned out that other people

587
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,210
had had them before. I guess that's always the case, right?

588
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,290
Someone out there is already doing it. Pretty, well,

589
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,640
I had to put a caveat in half my PhD thesis because I did it independently.

590
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,720
But then before I submitted it, I actually found out that 15 years earlier,

591
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,610
some guy in some journal I'd never heard of had done it. I mean,

592
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,710
it wasn't exactly the same, but certainly it was a big enough overlap.

593
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,670
So I had to put a little sort of disclaimer in there. So yeah,

594
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:28,070
it's pretty hard to have a real new idea. Got it. Sean,

595
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,210
actually I just want to mention one last thing before we see what everyone else

596
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:32,750
is saying there.

597
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,170
This kind of goes back to, you told me like,

598
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,310
I remember I used to try to bug you like four years ago, sending you emails,

599
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,490
try to pick your brain around earnings and stuff.

600
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,930
And you told me like specialization is very important.

601
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,070
And at the time I asked you, I said like,

602
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,660
can I really go deep into these earnings and maybe try to find edge?

603
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,540
And you said like that is going to be probably better for a retail trader to really

604
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,310
like learn about these earnings. And those edges could last forever,

605
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,030
or not forever, but for a very long period of time.

606
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,920
So- In general, that's good advice. In that specific case,

607
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,780
that was terrible advice because we now found out that there's really not much to

608
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,080
learn.

609
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,700
But I, okay. So I do think in general,

610
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,060
specialization is probably the way to go.

611
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,780
You don't get paid to be a generalist.

612
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,990
So the best way to make money is to know as much as possible about one thing and

613
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:43,990
then just hammer on that one thing until it goes away. Like it's,

614
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,280
a lot of people sort of like to bang on about traders who they're out of the game

615
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,900
now, who only traded for five years.

616
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,900
But I knew guys who only traded for five years.

617
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,860
And then they'd made so much money, they wanted to keep trading,

618
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,420
but they were pit traders, say, right? And the pit went away. Yeah,

619
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,480
their game went away,

620
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,160
but they'd made so much money that it wasn't really a disaster.

621
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,280
And that's way better than the guys who are like, well,

622
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,980
I'll just make slow and steady money, blah, blah, blah, keep on going.

623
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,900
And that's really, that's the wrong way to do it because nothing lasts.

624
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,280
Once you found something that lasts, you've got to pound on it. Love that.

625
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,140
Hit it while it's there, right? Yeah,

626
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,240
particularly if you think it's an inefficiency. If it's a risk premium,

627
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,940
you don't have to do that because you can make a pretty good bet it will be there

628
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:37,320
forever. I mean, they come and go. They tend to come back is what I'm saying.

629
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,480
Whereas an inefficiency, yeah, you've got to really whack it.

630
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,420
Even this earnings thing, it's nowhere near as good as it used to be,

631
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,160
mainly because liquidity in those front weeks has really got way worse.

632
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,170
And I don't really understand why,

633
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,530
but I used to be able to put down five times as much size as I can now,

634
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,330
like easily.

635
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,920
I think also some Aussie guy wrote a book about earnings trading and that kind of

636
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,720
give away some of the alpha.

637
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,550
I was going to say something about Australians, but I'll just leave it.

638
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,650
You can take it as implied what I was going to say.

639
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,340
Sean, any questions there, Sean?

640
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,920
Yeah, there's a few questions,

641
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,650
but I think we'll go to like maybe a more general one about learning about trading,

642
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,050
really. Obviously with,

643
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,310
there's huge influx of retail traders in the last couple of years,

644
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,770
maybe like three, four years tops.

645
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,650
And with that comes this huge influx of educational resources,

646
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:48,870
of all different shapes and sizes. And in the markets,

647
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,170
obviously signal to noise ratio is very low,

648
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,770
but it seems to be the same way in the education space now. And it can,

649
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:00,430
if you had to start over again, what sort of path would you follow to learn?

650
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:02,970
How would you go about it?

651
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,820
Yeah, okay. So when I started our training course,

652
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,120
and you've got to bear in mind, this was at a medium-sized market-making firm.

653
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,380
This was a market-making firm that had like 30 or 40 people.

654
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,460
So it wasn't like two guys and a clerk. This was, we went Susquehanna,

655
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,140
but it was decent.

656
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,080
The training program largely consisted of mock trading and telling us to read Hull.

657
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,320
That is not the most efficient way to learn anything.

658
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:43,650
The book that I wish I'd found really early on was Beard's book called Option Market

659
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,630
-Making. And it still holds up today. I think it was published in like 1994,

660
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,950
something like that. It's a great book. That's the one thing I wish I'd found.

661
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,340
Because a lot of the stuff,

662
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:03,250
I sort of had to sort of piece it all together myself and kind of learn it.

663
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:08,130
It was all out there. Like if you look at volatility trading,

664
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:15,000
I don't think there's anything original in that book. I mean, it was all there.

665
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,280
It was just a matter of putting it all together and putting it in a logical process.

666
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,160
Like this is how you do a trade. You start here, you do this, you do this.

667
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,940
And that took me, I don't know, seven or eight years to get to that point.

668
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,210
So I think from that perspective,

669
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,670
it's easier now for people because they can basically,

670
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,330
there's two or three books they could read that get them a hell of a long way along

671
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,410
that path. Of course, you can't just read the book and know it.

672
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,940
It takes time for stuff to sink in. They still help.

673
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,280
So I think that's the big advantage people have.

674
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,120
The disadvantage they have is there's a lot of option education stuff that's just

675
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,100
complete garbage,

676
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,760
like actively damaging horrific things that people are being taught.

677
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,130
Like, it seems like in the option education space,

678
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,770
having like one or two years worth of experience makes you somehow a veteran.

679
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:18,810
And I kind of thought one or two years of experience and a veteran meant you were

680
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:23,010
either an athlete or a porn star. I mean,

681
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,910
I don't really think that trading for a couple of years means you know enough to

682
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,980
teach anyone else. So I think that's the hard thing.

683
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,040
I think you guys are doing some good stuff, to be honest.

684
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,770
Most people aren't. Most stuff's just terrible,

685
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,880
like actively damaging horrific things that say things to people that are just not

686
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,260
true and will cause them to lose a lot of money. And I think in most cases,

687
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,600
it's because the people selling it are not charlatans.

688
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,520
I just don't think they know what they're talking about.

689
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,890
Interesting. So, okay,

690
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,230
let's say you're one to two years into your learning about trading.

691
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,140
How do you know if you're learning bullshit? Like, how do you actually take,

692
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,200
like, do you have an idea of how you can step aside and go, wait,

693
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,680
how do you evaluate it? Well, you don't know. That's the problem. Yeah. I mean,

694
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,540
you might know if you survive and then look back.

695
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,180
But, okay, so I was teaching physics for a year at university.

696
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,740
And sometimes when I'm teaching all these first year students who are only doing

697
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,540
it as a med prereq, not interested, right?

698
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,340
I'm not particularly interested either. And I was just thinking,

699
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,370
what if I just start lying to them? You know,

700
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,310
what if I just start making up stuff about electricity? You know,

701
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,230
telling them that electricity, I don't know,

702
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,730
consists of liquid flowing in pipes and the important stuff is it's green.

703
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,330
Just making crap up.

704
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,770
And they really wouldn't have known because you're teaching them something that

705
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,820
they don't know. So they don't know what they don't know.

706
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,920
So that's the hard bit. If it was obvious you were being taught crap,

707
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,200
then you'd just stop listening. I don't know if there's a way around that.

708
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,220
What we try to do is say, learn from people who are verified.

709
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:19,200
So we tell them to learn from people like you, Aaron Brown, Augustine LeBron.

710
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,120
We say, read what these people have to say.

711
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,580
And then it kind of trains your mind to be able to pick out what's BS and what's

712
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,480
legit. So I feel like that's been working for us so far.

713
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,000
But what are your thoughts on that?

714
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,310
Yeah, I think certainly with those two.

715
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:41,920
Okay,

716
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,760
so they're a little different because they're not really teaching you about the

717
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,780
specifics of trading. It's more about the philosophy of trading.

718
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,700
Like I think Aaron's book is kind of like sitting down beside the fire with your

719
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,480
old uncle and he's got his pipe and he's like, all right, listen,

720
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,480
this is how you do this. It's kind of general advice.

721
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,520
And Augustine's book is phenomenal book.

722
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,020
And it's one of the few books that I think I appreciate now with a lot of experience.

723
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,160
I don't think I would have appreciated it more.

724
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,440
I don't think I would have gotten as much out of it as I do now.

725
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,220
And I think it's very rare for that because it's pretty rare that I read something

726
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:31,420
and I'm like, wow, that's wow. So I think with those guys,

727
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,300
it's not so much that,

728
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,020
I think you're getting better able to pick out bullshit because with those guys,

729
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,860
you're actually learning stuff. So you're actually learning this is real.

730
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,500
It's not just,

731
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,140
you're not just taking it on faith that it's because Aaron Brown said it or Emanuel

732
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,160
Derman said it.

733
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,940
But yeah, those, I think Augustine's book's amazing.

734
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:00,150
I don't think it's a really good book about trading necessarily,

735
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,470
but I'm not sure really.

736
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:06,230
Because he says that there are lessons for the rest of your life.

737
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,840
And I'm always kind of skeptical about that. It's like people are like,

738
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,560
if you're a good poker player, you'll become a good trader. I'm like, no,

739
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,520
you won't. I mean, poker's poker, trading's trading. It's like golf and tennis.

740
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,680
Yeah, you're both hitting something with a stick,

741
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,380
but they're pretty different sports, right?

742
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,460
So I think generally that kind of crossover is anyone who tells you that is someone

743
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,740
who's a poker player who's trying to convince you they can become a good trader

744
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,900
just because of that. But I think with those books, it's really, yeah,

745
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,380
they were good.

746
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,900
It's funny, we actually have both you and Augustine, actually,

747
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,600
your books are like required reading for PA.

748
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,100
I can see,

749
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,950
his book's one of those ones I think I'm gonna read every year again.

750
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,950
Whereas I think with a lot of options, like fundamental books,

751
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:04,410
once you've got them, you've got them. Certainly with Hull,

752
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:09,340
I haven't picked up Hull for like 20 years. Do you read any David Aaronson?

753
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,440
Sorry? David Aaronson. What about him? Do you read any of his books?

754
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,820
I've read one of his books, I thought he only had one. I read it,

755
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,780
I thought it was quite good. The funny thing, so he writes this huge book,

756
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,180
it's about 600 pages, right?

757
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,960
And it basically goes through and disproves every single thing about technical analysis.

758
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,060
It turns out the guy's really into technical analysis.

759
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,740
I was on a mailing list that he was on for a while and he's always posting this

760
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,960
technical analysis stuff, like he's really into it. Interesting. Yeah,

761
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,580
so it's kind of like a UFO hunter, right?

762
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,720
Who's said that everyone else is wrong, but by the way, I still believe it.

763
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,880
I've got this little Greek man who lives down in my garden.

764
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,130
Yeah, his book's pretty good. You know what, actually,

765
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:08,610
you should give his book, it's called the TSSB Manual. It's really,

766
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:14,090
he built a software around backtesting and it's actually a really good data science

767
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,330
book.

768
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:20,470
I like a ton for that book and it was actually recommended to me by a strange,

769
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,530
from Sergey.

770
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,670
So yeah, really good book,

771
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:28,840
it's a good read.

772
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,170
Jordan, any other questions there you wanna ask? Yeah, definitely.

773
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,050
So Yoon, so you mentioned,

774
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:52,510
like we were just talking about learning from people and I'm curious to know who

775
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:58,730
your mentors were growing up and when you were learning this field.

776
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,390
And do you think like you would have been able to pick this up quickly if you didn't

777
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,510
have the right mentors along your journey?

778
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:16,860
I think everyone's got this idea that there is a perfect mentor for them that they

779
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,580
need. I never had that one person.

780
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,280
There were a lot of people who taught me various things along the way that I think

781
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,700
were indispensable. You know, and people are like,

782
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,920
what trader did you learn the most from?

783
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,440
And I feel like I'm always meant to say something like some famous person that they've

784
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,280
heard of. You know, and it wasn't,

785
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,900
it was just some guy who I sat beside when I was trading the DAX and he was the

786
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,440
one who sort of yelled at me every day for a year and a half.

787
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,880
And I learned probably the most from market making about from that guy.

788
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,000
You know, and he's just a guy.

789
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,800
So I think there've been a lot of people along those lines,

790
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,080
just along the way that I've sort of picked up stuff from here and there.

791
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,760
And you kind of need, at each point of your career, you need someone like that.

792
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,900
It doesn't have to be the same person all the time,

793
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,360
but you kind of need someone,

794
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,840
even if it's just someone to go out with after work and complain about something,

795
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,960
or when it's been a bad day and when some guy, he's like, come on,

796
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,280
let's just go and get a beer. I mean, that really helps a lot.

797
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:28,400
And I don't think, I don't know if this is a different job from other jobs.

798
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,860
I haven't had any other jobs, but I know in this job,

799
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,800
it's really hard to sort of do it on your own. It's really hard.

800
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,080
It would really be hard to just go and live in a little mountain cabin somewhere

801
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,060
and figure all this out on your own. I think there's just,

802
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,780
it would take you too long. That's probably true of everything.

803
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,220
And what you say trading is a craftsmanship and the money's in the nuances?

804
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,380
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I think 90,

805
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,780
like I think 95% of stuff you can tell other people and it doesn't make any difference

806
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,990
to your P&L. So people will be like, oh, well, you've written all these books,

807
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,400
so none of that stuff can work anymore. I'm like, well,

808
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,520
I didn't tell you the stuff that I thought would ruin my life. I mean,

809
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,720
there's plenty of stuff that I didn't tell you.

810
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,000
There's plenty of stuff that I didn't put in the books.

811
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,940
But I think most stuff that you need is actually out there.

812
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,900
I don't think the secret sauce is nearly as important as people think.

813
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,160
It'll make a difference. It'll take you from being good to really good.

814
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,600
But most of the stuff is relatively well understood,

815
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,020
but it's just spread out amongst a whole bunch of different places.

816
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,900
So I think it is about the details.

817
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:45,930
Got it.

818
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:54,900
Someone shared me a really interesting post where the person went on a rowing excursion

819
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,020
with their father.

820
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:02,340
And they said the difference between the first place boat and the last place boat

821
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,120
was nothing really, like it wasn't something special.

822
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,160
It was just like the fine details that they did a little bit better. Yeah,

823
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,850
I think that's true when you get to like the Olympic level where you're dealing

824
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,450
with everyone who's just amazingly athletic.

825
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,650
I don't think that's true at like the high school level.

826
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:27,220
I played sports in high school and there were a couple of guys who went on to play

827
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:31,730
for New Zealand. And it's not one of those things, ooh, he never stood out. No,

828
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:35,190
he stood out. From the age of eight, he was just way better than everyone else.

829
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:40,430
When you get to international level, I think natural talent is pretty close.

830
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:49,380
I would say that it's like with intelligence. Do you need,

831
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:55,760
there's no correlation between intelligence and trading ability once you're a professional

832
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,230
trader. But if you don't meet a certain bar,

833
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,930
you're never gonna get to that point.

834
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,890
So there's no difference between someone with an IQ of 110 and 180.

835
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:10,690
But if you've got an IQ of 70, you're just not gonna meet that first hurdle.

836
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,920
Got it. I think.

837
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,740
Sean, if you don't have any more questions there,

838
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,700
I just got one last question for you that was asked by Jens. All right,

839
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,360
let's let it rip.

840
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,750
So what are you looking at right now? What are some things that,

841
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:37,690
some strategies that are in the works or that you're working on or other areas that

842
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,750
you're looking into? Are you looking into crypto, crypto vols?

843
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,110
What's really taking up your time right now?

844
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:52,460
I've just got this equity vol thing implemented across a wide enough number of names.

845
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,900
So that's something I've been working on for a long time.

846
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,680
I have been looking at crypto a little bit.

847
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:06,630
The problem with crypto is that it's still immensely decentralized to the point

848
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,690
where I think it's one of those things, unless you're really into it, I mean,

849
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,670
you can't dabble in it to the point where you'd get a Coinbase account and buy some

850
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,790
Ethereum or something. That's not gonna do it.

851
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:23,330
You have to be on all these blockchains that no one's ever heard of.

852
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:27,130
And you have to be trading these ridiculous coins and getting these stupid tokens

853
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,250
and farming them out.

854
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:35,990
So I don't really think it's one of those things you can just do sort of half-arsed.

855
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,990
Whereas I think if you're just gonna do something as sort of a hobby,

856
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:43,330
the US equity market's great because you just need an IB account and then you can

857
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,270
pull up something and click on it. You can't do that with crypto.

858
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,860
And I hate all that other stuff. Yeah. I don't know.

859
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,880
I don't know if I've actually come across the hurdle yet to put in a big portion

860
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,290
of my capital into a decentralized exchange.

861
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,890
I wonder if that maybe creates some sort of opportunity, right? For sure.

862
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:10,150
Some of the alpha or money these guys are making is just unbelievable,

863
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,910
or the inefficiencies they're finding. There were, for a while, you could,

864
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:14,890
I did this,

865
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:19,590
but for a while you could make 40% just by lending out US stablecoins.

866
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:24,050
So it was literally like lending a dollar and getting 40% back. I mean,

867
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,610
the basis spreads on these things were ridiculous,

868
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:32,340
but that seemed to go away very quickly. It was there for years, right?

869
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:36,720
But then it went away just like that. And now it's much more difficult.

870
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,520
I think the crypto guys I know now are making a lot less than they did in, say,

871
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,760
April. There are some,

872
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,780
I used to think if you found a really complicated product that you understood,

873
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,570
that could be an edge. I'm not sure that is true anymore.

874
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:00,880
I'm not sure just knowing the product is enough to do that on its own,

875
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,990
but there are some crazy Bitcoin options out there. They're like,

876
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:12,340
they're called inverse options, right? So they're, it's a,

877
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:19,320
it would be a Bitcoin option where the strike is in dollars,

878
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:28,170
but it's paid out in Bitcoins. So as the Bitcoin's moving around, the amount,

879
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,210
not only is the amount that it's in or out of the money changing,

880
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:36,930
but the amount that you would get is changing as well in dollar terms.

881
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:43,000
So the payoff becomes really weird and nonlinear. So that kind of fun.

882
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,100
I did a bit of consulting on someone for that,

883
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,730
but I've never tried to trade them. I think Deribit lists them,

884
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,830
and I think Deribit has like 90% of the Bitcoin options.

885
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,700
So that's kind of weird because an at the money option will have like a Delta of

886
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:04,420
like one. For some of those exchanges, for some of those coins,

887
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,940
like those smaller cap coins? No,

888
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:14,080
for the way they've defined the option payoff. Oh. I mean, it's true.

889
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,300
If you look at, if Bitcoin moves by a dollar,

890
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:23,220
the value of this option changes by almost nothing because a dollar in percentage

891
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:26,900
terms is minimal because Bitcoin's like, I don't know, what is it?

892
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,180
45,000 bucks or something. And that's what it means for a Delta. So yeah,

893
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,180
the Delta of an at the money option because everything's in percentage terms.

894
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,020
So that's kind of fun,

895
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,810
but I've never actually tried to make money trading them.

896
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,880
That could be interesting space.

897
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,140
There's like so many products that are being pushed out like almost every day now.

898
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:50,380
Yeah. Sorry, go on. What's up with that equity ball?

899
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,920
Do you mind maybe just chatting a little bit about it? Sure.

900
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,900
What do you want to know about it? Well,

901
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,460
you just mentioned like you're working to make equity ball strategy right now.

902
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:11,900
What's the basis of the idea? Okay. So maybe 15 years ago,

903
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:20,730
you could make money just by doing like a GARCH forecast of to forecast the vol

904
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,130
for every stock that had options on it.

905
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,520
Calculate what you thought the variance premium was, buy all the cheap stuff,

906
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,350
sell all the expensive stuff. And you'd make, you know, 20% a year doing that.

907
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,950
Now, I'm not saying it's impossible to forecast volatility,

908
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:45,940
but it's really difficult to the point where it might not be worth the effort of

909
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,140
doing it, even if it is possible to do it.

910
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:54,330
But the relative value of options is still all over the place.

911
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,730
So I'm not trying to forecast the level of the implied vol.

912
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,190
I'm forecasting basically the shape of the curve.

913
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,810
So I'd end up doing a lot of butterflies, basically.

914
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:13,680
And is that,

915
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:18,740
are you doing a butterfly across the term structure or across the expiration?

916
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:25,500
Across strike, okay. Yeah. So like, there'll be a lot of things where I'll,

917
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,660
you know, all the other way around,

918
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:33,220
like I'll be long at the monies and then short the 10 delta options. Got it.

919
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,800
Possibly in some sort of ratio, but that's sort of, yeah,

920
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,280
it's relative option pricing.

921
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,000
I think there's more edge in relative option pricing than absolute.

922
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:49,580
You've got to do a lot more. You've got to do a lot more things though,

923
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:53,180
because the actual edge, once you've got all these spreads on, is smaller,

924
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,620
because, you know, it just is.

925
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:01,680
And do you just mind breaking down what do you mean by better trades in absolute

926
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,990
versus, or better trades in relative versus absolute? Yeah,

927
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:11,550
I think it's very difficult now to value an at the money option.

928
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:19,400
Like if the implied vol of an at the money option is 18,

929
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:25,460
it's really difficult to come up with any better value from that. Look,

930
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,620
if you take out the variance premium, so you can actually do that, right?

931
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,080
You can say the average variance premium has been this.

932
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,100
There's a lot of work you could do on that.

933
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:37,420
But let's say the implied vol is 18. Correcting for the variance premium,

934
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:44,920
your forecast is 16. That's, the edge in that now is really small.

935
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:49,820
Those trades are probably not worth doing on their own in most cases.

936
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:58,760
Not all cases, but most. But certainly there are tons of cases where, okay,

937
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,720
so right now,

938
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,720
if you look at the NASDAQ structure,

939
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:11,270
NASDAQ is begging to have a trade put on where you sell the NASDAQ 10 delta puts

940
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,050
and you buy constituent 10 delta puts.

941
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:20,390
Because there's a ton of single stock options in there that basically have a flat

942
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:25,260
vol structure. So you look at something like Intel.

943
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,280
Intel puts are basically trading flat to the at the monies.

944
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,420
And there's a whole bunch of them like that.

945
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:40,950
Mega cap tech puts right now are really cheap. Interesting. Yeah,

946
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,550
so there's stuff like that. But normally I don't even do it across,

947
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,060
I wouldn't do it like a dispersion thing. I'll just do it within Intel.

948
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,260
So if I make that observation,

949
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:57,560
I'll just buy the at the monies and sell the puts. Got it.

950
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,260
I guess you could go the other way around. Sell the puts,

951
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:04,360
buy the at the monies. Because the term structure is flat, right.

952
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,780
I guess with those kinds of trades, you can get some pretty good size on,

953
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:15,220
right? Because it's super liquid and it's not too much risk to that.

954
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,970
What do you think about that? Some of these things,

955
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:29,770
I like to trade in the really short dated options for a couple of reasons.

956
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:34,390
We've gone into the edge reason, but there's also, you get better feedback.

957
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,800
Because if I'm trading weekly options, I'm doing like 52 trades a year.

958
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,720
If I'm trading monthly, I'm only doing 12.

959
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:47,290
So I get to know if I'm doing well or not much quicker, which is a huge plus.

960
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:54,540
So I would say there's maybe 300 stocks I can do this kind of trade on.

961
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:59,530
So that's pretty liquid. But there's still transaction costs,

962
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:03,510
but the other thing about weeklies is I very rarely trade out of them.

963
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:07,030
Just have them for a week and let them expire. Yeah.

964
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,250
Cool. That's one way of halving your transaction costs.

965
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:18,100
Sean, anything else you wanna add there in the week? Yeah,

966
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,840
I got two more questions for you here.

967
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,660
So coming back to reading SSRN articles and things of that nature,

968
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:30,840
do you think it's worth spending a lot of time going through that type of stuff?

969
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,680
And with the volume there and everything,

970
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,540
do you try to read every abstract or could you recommend like,

971
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,620
do you do like a certain keyword search, anything of that nature to filter?

972
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,020
Yeah.

973
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:52,800
Okay, so we were talking about shitty advice, like terrible advice.

974
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:58,150
There's one of the worst pieces of advice that people get told is you've got to

975
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:02,200
find a way of trading that suits your personality, okay?

976
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,060
That is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. If you wanna learn golf,

977
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,660
no one's gonna tell you,

978
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,680
find a way of playing golf that suits your personality.

979
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,900
What you're gonna do is you're gonna get the best coach you can and they will teach

980
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,020
you how to actually play. Trading's like that as well.

981
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,740
If it turns out that the shit you like loses money,

982
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,500
you liking it isn't gonna change that.

983
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,860
So that's one of the problems people have with buying options. They're like,

984
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,980
I like to buy options. Well, that's great. You also like to lose money.

985
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,800
Do you not like money? Then great, keep buying options.

986
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:41,040
So I'm not telling you that I do this because it's the way that works for me,

987
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,500
but there's certainly an element of that involved in this as well, right?

988
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,280
So in the research process, I think you can say that.

989
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,040
I learn a lot from going through the archive in SSRN.

990
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,120
The archive less than I used to because now it's all about machine learning stuff.

991
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:05,210
And those papers just aren't very good to read because it's always like,

992
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:08,050
I tried to predict the fixed term structure.

993
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:11,690
So I threw all this data into a black box and then I got these numbers out.

994
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:17,100
You're like, well, what do I do with that? But anyway, yeah,

995
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:25,940
I look at SSRN maybe a couple of times a week and I look at the JEL classification

996
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:31,260
for general financial markets, which I think is J1, sorry, G1.

997
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:38,810
And I do a keyword search for volatility and for options and for trading.

998
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:45,280
And normally I'll look as a result of that at maybe 20 abstracts a week.

999
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:50,370
And of those, I might read the introduction and conclusion of five.

1000
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,760
I'll probably only read one full paper every month or so. There's a lot of,

1001
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,490
it's fishing. You throw a lot of lines out and nothing comes back,

1002
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,030
but occasionally something does.

1003
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,400
I'm sure everyone here knows about the Uvexy decay trade, right?

1004
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:12,650
All that stuff on leveraged ETFs was published way before people were actually doing

1005
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:12,890
it.

1006
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:17,490
So there's a lot of great stuff on leveraged ETFs out there that's been published.

1007
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:20,850
You know what you might find interesting, Yoon,

1008
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:24,090
is there's like four and five X leveraged ETFs,

1009
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:29,220
ETNs in Europe that I haven't looked into it too much,

1010
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,920
but it could be a nice potential pairs trade for the decay.

1011
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,160
I don't know if that's a real thing or not.

1012
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,540
I was having a debate with my buddy. You don't know which bit's a real thing.

1013
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:47,800
So let's say for example, going to short TQQQ and SQQQ. You know,

1014
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,820
Delta hedging every so often. I mean, that used to work.

1015
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:53,960
Actually,

1016
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,980
TQQQ is about the only one that wouldn't have worked on because that thing's just

1017
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:01,500
skyrocketed, but it works. If you put a portfolio together of long, short,

1018
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,910
so you're directionally neutral,

1019
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:08,830
it worked apart from when you took borrow costs into account and then it wouldn't

1020
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:15,100
work. But in theory, that works. I don't know about these European ones.

1021
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:21,680
It's hard to trade European stuff as a non-institutional customer. Yeah,

1022
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:27,140
they have all those exotics over there that you can buy as a retail client,

1023
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:31,880
but IBKR won't let you sell them. And like the edges on them are huge,

1024
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,180
but just being sold by banks.

1025
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:41,710
It's actually pretty easy to replicate a leveraged ETF of anything you want because

1026
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:43,370
you know what they have to do.

1027
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,730
So basically you just do the opposite because you're shorting it.

1028
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,630
You do the opposite trading that they do.

1029
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:54,650
And it all basically comes down to a sort of, that's complicated,

1030
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,890
but it's an autocorrelation trade. It's basically a vol pump.

1031
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,630
So you can do it yourself.

1032
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:03,050
Like if you wanted to replicate your own 20 times leveraged ETF,

1033
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:08,020
you could do it up to the level of what you can borrow from your broker.

1034
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,440
But doing a three times leveraged one would be easy.

1035
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,340
So you can do it on anything you like, really. So there you go.

1036
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:22,700
If you're mad that Uvexy isn't two times levered anymore,

1037
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:27,960
just do a bit of math and do it yourself. Yeah, got it. Got it.

1038
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,160
Arshad, if there's nothing else there,

1039
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:36,240
I got a lot of other questions here from the guys as well. Yeah,

1040
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:42,470
I feel bad because I know there's like a hundred and something comments in the chat,

1041
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,590
which I've only just noticed.

1042
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:45,770
And we probably haven't got to most of those questions,

1043
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:50,090
but I also feel that's somewhat inevitable. A hundred percent.

1044
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:53,730
You and the guys love you, man. The guys love you in this group.

1045
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,930
So if you ever have spare time,

1046
01:13:55,990 --> 01:14:00,310
we'd love to have you answer some questions in there. Well,

1047
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,250
they might only love me because they haven't met me.

1048
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,910
I think someone asked me once how you know,

1049
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,640
I think my only differentiating skill is I'm pretty self-aware about what I do and

1050
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,020
don't know. So, you know, the whole Dunning-Kruger thing,

1051
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,080
I think I'm relatively good at avoiding that,

1052
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,280
but I think that's the only thing.

1053
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,300
I'm pretty good at saying something if I don't know it.

1054
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,120
So I think that's my plus.

1055
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,500
Got it. Let's do another one of these sometime. Yeah, a hundred percent. Yeah,

1056
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:38,140
as soon as I get my air conditioning working up here next time. So I'm not...

1057
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,560
Yeah, so you can take the pressure from all the questions, right? Yeah,

1058
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,320
that's the excuse.

1059
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,680
I just said the air conditioning was off and it's really just... So funny,

1060
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,220
it's like next time we have this, Yun comes, she's shirtless.

1061
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:57,060
I feel like I should have been. This is ridiculous. Thanks a lot, guys.

1062
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,160
I guess I'll... No, thank you. I'll turn up on Discord again.

1063
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,040
Does anyone like Discord? What a garbage platform that is. Oh,

1064
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,900
you're kidding me. I think the layout and stuff,

1065
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,540
I think Slack's better and I hate Slack as well. I gotta disagree.

1066
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,720
I think it's the best chat messaging platform out, man. Telegram's all right.

1067
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:21,580
Telegram's pretty good. Oh, you know, maybe I'm just old. Maybe I'm like,

1068
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,740
I don't understand these kids with all their platforms. I was gonna say...

1069
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,160
Why can't we just use SMS messages? I was gonna say,

1070
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,420
you're not a fan of all the Pepe emojis and everything?

1071
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:35,160
I just can't navigate the threads. Whatever.

1072
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,740
That's where the best conversation's going down.

1073
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:43,520
You gotta figure that part out. I haven't spent a great amount of time on it,

1074
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,580
but it could be also...

1075
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:48,880
I think inevitably you reach this age where you're just like, ah, technology,

1076
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:49,520
fuck it.

1077
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,580
It was funny today. I was telling Sean, I was like, hey,

1078
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,280
I don't think Yoon really likes me that much.

1079
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:00,860
He's never answering me in the Discord. And Sean's like,

1080
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:06,360
I just don't think he understands how to navigate it. Well, and I also... Yeah,

1081
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,280
that could be it. But I don't go on there that much either. I mean,

1082
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,940
if people actually want to ask me stuff,

1083
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,700
you're probably better off DMing me on Twitter.

1084
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:18,100
That's probably an easier way to do it. Well,

1085
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,680
I will say that I've gotten some DMs.

1086
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,760
The guys really appreciate you when you do pop in and share your thoughts on their

1087
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,760
questions, things like that. It's been good. Great. Well,

1088
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:34,300
I'm glad I helped someone. You having a couple more beers tonight? Me? Yeah.

1089
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,680
I haven't had any. You're the ones who've been drinking.

1090
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:42,540
What were you drinking? That was like a LaCroix or something. Yeah,

1091
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,620
it was just a water.

1092
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:49,660
It looks like a grapefruit IPA, right? Yeah, as he said, the old,

1093
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:54,200
it's not vodka, it's water trick. Okay.

1094
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,860
All right, guys. All right. Well, thanks. Have a great night. Yeah,

1095
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,500
have a great night. This was awesome. Thank you. See you, Sean. Talk soon.
