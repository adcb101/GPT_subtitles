1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280
Go ahead.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,320
OK, guys, so in this lab, we're going to be talking about synthetics.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,900
We're going to be talking about different types of strategies.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,500
It's going to be a very interesting live and a deep thinking live,

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,220
in my opinion.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,540
It's it's actually probably one of the fundamental lives.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,100
Let's say if you were to get onto a trading desk,

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,600
this would be one of the lives that that they would chat with you about or one of

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,680
the lectures they would give you.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,000
So I think it's a really good one for you guys to be involved in.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,060
OK, so let's get started. We can pull this up and share my screen.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,140
Sean, do you want to make me host there?

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,200
So we're going to use Tesla for this example here.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:04,260
All right. So there was two strategies. OK,

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,240
I'm going to give four strategies here, four bullish strategies.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,040
And I want us to rank them from the best to the worst.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
If you actually do know the answer,

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,530
please don't please don't write it just so everyone can really start to think about

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,350
it. So that's what we're going to be doing. OK,

20
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,590
so four bullish strategies as a group.

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,420
We're going to rank them from best to worst and the reason why. OK,

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,200
and like again, like I said, I didn't see Steve B on the live.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,640
But for anyone else who actually knows the answers,

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,000
please don't please don't give it away. OK, so here we are.

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,780
We are bullish on Tesla. OK, and I've seen a couple of these strategies,

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,240
so I just want to get your guys opinion on it and we'll rank them.

27
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,920
So one of the famous ones that I've seen is the wheel. OK, the wheels,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,180
a bullish strategy. And you guys can correct me if I'm wrong.

29
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,230
But the idea is you buy the shares, you sell a call. OK,

30
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,770
and if the stock goes up,

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,560
you're going to your shares are going to get called away and you're going to sell

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,770
a put. OK, and then you're just going to keep doing that over and over again.

33
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,630
So if the stock comes down, you're going to buy that.

34
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,170
You're going to get called on shares, you buy the shares,

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,210
and then you sell a covered call.

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,440
So you're rotating between selling a covered call and selling a short put. OK,

37
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,320
everyone knows the wheel, right? Let's open up the chat here.

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,040
It's going to be a little bit of more interactive, interactive live.

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,500
So let's really chat about this.

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,410
Now, they're just roasting us for having ads all over our browsers.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,000
Or everyone understands the wheel, though.

42
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,130
OK, Trent, saying the wheel was my main thing. Yeah, it makes sense, right?

43
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,150
You buy the shares, you sell a call. If the call gets called away,

44
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,370
you're going to sell the puts. And if the stock goes down,

45
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,290
you're going to buy the shares, sell a call.

46
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,690
Or if the stock continues to go up, you collect the premium, right?

47
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,710
Everyone knows this, the wheel.

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,950
So that's the first strategy.

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,720
The second strategy I saw is hanging around somewhere is you sell an in the money

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,020
put.

51
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,850
OK, the share goes up. You're going to sell an out of the money put.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,570
And if the share comes down, you're going to buy that,

53
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,800
buy that put back and sell them in the money put. OK, so let me just,

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,700
I'm actually going to draw these out. So we're all,

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,160
everyone's on the same page here. OK, so first off, we had the wheel.

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,150
And the wheel is, you sell a call, sell a covered call. OK, Jordan,

57
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:00,920
don't do it this way. Use the text, just you can write it out. Got it, got it,

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,580
got it, got it. Yeah, good point, good point. OK, so wheel. OK,

59
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,020
sell a covered call.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,950
OK, you can do it as a list. Yeah, you can do it as a list,

61
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,630
like you can have key points. Right, so if you just hit enter,

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,130
it'll just drop it down. You have a text box. Got it, got it. Perfect. OK,

63
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,010
so sell a covered call. And once you sell a covered call,

64
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,850
two things can happen. So scenario one, our shares, our shares get called away,

65
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,320
in which case we will sell put. Scenario two,

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,460
the shares go down and we collect the covered call.

67
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,920
OK, that's strategy one. Wheel,

68
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,840
I just want to make sure everyone's OK with this. Can everyone just say,

69
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,620
I understand the wheel or Jordan, I don't understand the wheel.

70
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,640
OK, perfect engagement, guys. Thanks, guys. OK. OK, strategy two.

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,560
I think I saw this on Reddit somewhere.

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,810
You start off by selling an in the money put.

73
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,030
And it kind of sound a little weird to me, to be honest,

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,280
when I saw this selling it in the money put to start. Then if the shares go up,

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,520
OK, scenario one, you keep the premium.

76
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,650
OK, if the shares go down,

77
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,560
then you you sell it out of the money put.

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,020
So shares go up, you get to collect the premium, shares go down,

79
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,860
you sell out of the money put.

80
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,290
OK, what do you guys what do you guys think about these two strategies so far?

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
What do you guys think about them?

82
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,460
Steve, I actually said I think you weren't here for it,

83
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
but if you actually know the answer,

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,220
we're going to be ranking a couple strategies. And if you know the answer,

85
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,080
please don't please don't say the answer. OK.

86
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,180
So strategy two, let me just make sure that everyone's clear with it.

87
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,680
You sell an in the money put stock goes down.

88
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,620
You sell an out of the money put the stock continues to go back up.

89
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,130
You sell it out of the money put. OK,

90
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,840
what do you guys think? Thanks to you. Appreciate it. Yeah, I Jordan,

91
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,420
I think there's a little confusion about strategy to here. OK. OK,

92
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,450
let's I'll break it down. For example. OK. OK, so in this case, we buy.

93
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,880
So in this case, strategy number two, we would sell an in the money put.

94
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:06,490
Let's say we sell a 700 dollar strike put now Tesla for Tesla.

95
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,750
So what do we want to happen there, guys? Just so we can go step by step.

96
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,970
We sell it in the money put.

97
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,380
What do we want to happen? We want it to go up. Thanks, Brian. Go up.

98
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,190
If it does go up, OK, if it does go up,

99
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,660
we're going to sell an out of the money put.

100
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,140
If it goes up, we're going to sell an out of the money put.

101
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,150
Maybe we're going to sell. Let's say if it goes like, let's say it goes to 700.

102
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,890
We're going to sell a 680 put.

103
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:51,840
OK. If it goes down. OK, let's say it goes down. Let's say it goes down to 600.

104
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,540
Well, we're going to buy back that put that we sold in the money at expiration,

105
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,030
and we're going to sell another in the money put. OK, so let's say it goes.

106
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,810
Let's say it goes down to 600. We're going to sell a 650 put.

107
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,120
OK, so it's a little fishy, right? But what do you guys think about that?

108
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,700
What's your what's your opinion on that so far?

109
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,460
Did I explain it there good, Sean? Ryan saying it seems like a bad idea.

110
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,400
Eric saying not a fan. Like a bad idea, not a.

111
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,490
Yeah. OK. Yeah. But what do you guys think about the wheel?

112
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,030
Did the wheel make sense to you guys or no?

113
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,710
Yeah. Writing in the money put sounds indefensible, right?

114
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,160
It just it's not making sense. Well, what do you guys think about the wheel?

115
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,150
Do you guys like the wheel? Do you not like the wheel?

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah. So Red made a couple of comments as well. What do you say?

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,140
It seems he said it seems risky to write a put right after the underlying increase

118
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,520
enough for the shares to get called away. Right.

119
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,890
So the thing here, guys, and this actually dawned on me.

120
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,990
So you guys know I'm not a big fan of the wheel, right? And Eric,

121
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,710
I saw your comment there. I ignored it for for a specific reason.

122
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,280
You guys know that I'm not a huge fan of the wheel, but a lot of people are.

123
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,550
However, a lot of people would hate strategy number two,

124
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,910
but they are the exact same thing.

125
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,550
Strategy number one and strategy number two are identical. Zero difference.

126
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,920
So we're going to go and we're going to we are going to we're going to we're going

127
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,400
to chat about it. So let's go with Tesla.

128
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,990
We're going to price this out so you guys can see exactly. OK.

129
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:09,840
And this is going to be our introduction into synthetics.

130
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,310
So let's say we're going to do the wheel on Tesla. All right.

131
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,690
So we're going to buy a covered call.

132
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,350
OK, so let's take a look.

133
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,670
So here it is. And you're still sharing your wife. Oh,

134
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,070
you're sharing your whiteboard, Jordan. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,280
OK, so they are the exact same exact same trade. So here's our covered call.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,320
And what is a covered call? It's an in the money put. They're the same thing.

137
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,960
OK, so let's say, for example, we do a covered call with strike 700.

138
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,960
So Tesla's trading at 680 and we'll do the 700 covered call.

139
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:13,780
This is exactly the same as selling the 700 in the money put.

140
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,980
Exactly the same trade. No difference.

141
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,070
There was a difference arbitrage. So we're selling it in the money put.

142
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,200
If the stock goes down, what do we do with the covered call? What we see,

143
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,310
we sell a new call, aka we sell a new in the money put. OK,

144
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,570
we still own the shares and we're just bringing down our strike.

145
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,960
So the wheel is, in fact, selling an in the money put. If the stock goes up,

146
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,620
you're going to sell an out of the money put. If the stock goes down,

147
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,160
you're going to sell another in the money put. OK, same thing.

148
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,840
And this is a synthetic covered call equals short put. Right.

149
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,700
What's the difference between a call and a put? Who remembers?

150
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,120
What's the difference between a call and a put?

151
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,220
Shares. Right. The difference. Good job, Trent.

152
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,670
The difference between a call and a put is shares. Right.

153
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:40,330
We can create this put with a call and shares. OK,

154
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:46,270
it's the only difference now. Which is basically the covered. Exactly.

155
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,370
And I see Red was saying it's easier to get trapped because of IV.

156
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,970
They're the exact same thing. The risk profile is identical. So check this out.

157
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,290
Implied vol, let's let's look at our Vega profile.

158
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,780
So you want to show the price slices on it? Yeah.

159
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,300
So let's look at our covered call here. OK.

160
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,990
Our Vega exposure on this is one thousand negative one thousand.

161
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,610
Our Vega exposure on the short put is negative one thousand.

162
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:22,770
So a ten point drop in implied volatility is going to be the same effect on the

163
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,390
call and the put. If there was a difference,

164
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,230
let's say there was a difference aside from dividends and interest rates.

165
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,590
If there was a difference, you could arbitrage. OK.

166
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,050
And this is synthetics one on one.

167
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,010
So we're going to do a whole bunch of synthetics today.

168
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,930
And I think you guys will find this very insightful.

169
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,560
So Danny's asking a question here. Are you saying if they are the same,

170
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,500
why the hell do people sell calls? Puts generally have more skew, right?

171
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,700
So they're the same thing. It's it's people. So I remember I saw on Facebook.

172
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,680
So this is like a this is why when you go to a trade firm,

173
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,640
this will be like the first thing, right? The synthetics trade one on one.

174
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,320
A lot of people say I like buying the dividend.

175
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,270
I like buying dividend stocks and selling covered calls on them or doing the wheels

176
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,800
on them. We've all heard it. Well,

177
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,880
and then I remember I had I had a talk with some guy on Facebook. I said, well,

178
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,060
why don't you sell the put? You're going to get more you get better financing.

179
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,570
And he said to me, I want the dividend. OK, now,

180
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:39,500
why doesn't that why does that not make sense? Or why could that not be?

181
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,900
Why would I be able to sell a covered call and capture the dividend,

182
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,580
but sell a put same strike and not capture that dividend?

183
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,840
What would you do in that case?

184
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,040
Right. The dividend is in the options price. It's baked into that option price.

185
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,340
OK, you can actually do dividend arbitrages with options.

186
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,050
That dividend is going to be baked into the option price.

187
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,640
Who's got a big high dividend paying stock that's having a dividend coming soon?

188
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,420
IBM, let's do IBM. I don't know if they're coming soon, but let's take a look,

189
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,660
guys.

190
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,120
Let's take a look at a three year option. OK, or sorry, a six month option.

191
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,070
So we're going to do we know we are going to come back to covered calls in a second.

192
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,710
We're going to do another one. We're going to do another synthetic.

193
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,890
We're going to do create synthetic shares.

194
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,110
So I'm going to sell a call. Sorry, I'm going to sell a put and buy a call.

195
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,460
Same strike.

196
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:04,060
OK, there it is. Here is our our shares exactly the same. Now,

197
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,380
some of you guys might say, well, look at this.

198
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,510
If the stock let's let's let's take a look at this, guys.

199
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,430
I know this might be a little bit tricky and I'll slow down if you guys need to,

200
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,150
but this is very important, right? This is this option is one on one.

201
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,340
Look at this, guys.

202
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,820
We can put this trade on where our break even is 131 and the stock's trading at

203
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,320
133. Why would I why would I buy shares when I could buy this?

204
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,360
Who's got the answer? OK, why is that my break even on this trade?

205
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,300
131 when the stock's trading at 133.

206
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,160
I basically get a free two dollars to put this on.

207
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,430
That's the dividend being priced into these options.

208
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,060
Right now. Question for you guys. Deep thinking question.

209
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,050
What would you do if IBM had no dividend and you saw this?

210
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,880
What would you do?

211
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,380
IBM had no dividend and you saw this.

212
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,040
Thank you, Harry. Our short the shares,

213
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,830
short the shares. Look at this, guys. Risk free profit coming in.

214
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,690
So I buy 10 of those combos and I sell a thousand shares.

215
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,860
I just walked in two thousand three hundred and thirty dollars risk free. OK,

216
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,920
the answer is there's a dividend by me showing those shares.

217
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,060
I have to pay that dividend.

218
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,570
And this is where a little bit of an arbitrage should come in,

219
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,680
because sometimes these options aren't pricing in the dividend arbitrage.

220
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,530
Or sometimes, for example,

221
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:16,790
a company grows its dividend over time and there's a risk, right?

222
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,070
A risk of the company not having the dividend or not growing the dividend.

223
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,380
And so that's not going to be priced into the option arbitrage.

224
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,720
So let's go back to our covered call.

225
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,560
And guys, make sure you slow me down. We really need to understand this.

226
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,430
So important. Oh, shoot. Oh, that's why.

227
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,990
So short put covered call. No difference. It makes people feel better that,

228
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,070
hey, I'm going to collect this premium if the stock goes down. Right.

229
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,550
I can sell a call. The stock goes down. I'm going to collect my premium.

230
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,230
I'll tell you a funny story, guys.

231
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,250
When I was first starting trading out and I found out about the covered calls,

232
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,620
I thought it was awesome. Right. I get to buy the shares, sell a call.

233
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,620
Worst case scenario, my shares get called away. And I called the guy at RBC.

234
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,960
And I was young. I was maybe 18 years old. I said, hey, listen,

235
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm learning all these covered calls. What's my risk here? You know,

236
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,260
I just seem so good to be true. What's like what's going on?

237
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,290
And the guy said to me, he said something like, yeah, there is no risk.

238
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,950
If the stock goes down, you collect the shares. The stock goes up.

239
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,930
You risk your things get taken away. No, he did say to me,

240
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,680
the worst case scenario for you is if the stock blows through the roof and your

241
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,440
shares get called away.

242
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,990
People people will look at a covered call and say, this is great.

243
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,460
But they will look at a naked short put. And they will say, holy cow,

244
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,140
unlimited loss. Right, Sean, you've seen it so many times.

245
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,410
Yeah, well, they'll argue to the ends of the earth,

246
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,800
but it's the exact same risk profile, like in terms of your exposures you have,

247
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,300
they're identical.

248
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,370
And if you stop and like really think about how the covered call sort of works.

249
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,280
It's like if the thing rips to the downside, you're going to lose. Right.

250
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,100
We can all see it. You know, you're like,

251
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,200
let's say you're holding a stock that's worth $100. And then you collect,

252
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,660
you sell a $5 call. It's like, well,

253
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,040
if the stock goes below $95 all the way down, you're losing money.

254
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,700
You can almost visualize it looks identical.

255
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,180
And if you think about that in your head,

256
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,450
it almost looks it look it's a short put. It looks like it, you know?

257
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,720
Yeah, exactly.

258
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,100
And I always find it funny when people say they're different because if they were

259
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,880
different, you would just arm them all day. Right. You make a fortune.

260
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,290
So that is that's what a synthetic is. OK,

261
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,670
so it's the creating something with something else.

262
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,760
So we're going to do a whole bunch today, guys. And before I even show them,

263
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,520
let's chat about them. Let's see who can get them. Besides Trent and Steve B,

264
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,600
because I know you guys will get them all.

265
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,510
A call spread. OK, a call spread. I'm going to price it out here.

266
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,370
And we're going to think of there's a few ways we can do it. OK.

267
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,190
I'm going to price this one out here. And I see this all the time, guys.

268
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,130
I see this all the time. It drives me up the walls.

269
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,340
So I apologize in advance if I get a little emotional during this live. OK,

270
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,520
I've had it. I've had it out with too many people. All right. So here we go.

271
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,530
Six fifty seven hundred call spread.

272
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,020
Let's see who can replicate this the most times. OK. Yeah, exactly, Parker.

273
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,820
How can we replicate this? How can we replicate this?

274
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,180
This is actually on the gold exam.

275
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,150
This is one of the questions on the gold exam. Coasting put spread. Love it.

276
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,960
What else? What are other ways we can we can create this? I love it. Love it.

277
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,600
Put spread.

278
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,540
We're going to we're going to we're going to price them all out here.

279
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,690
How else can we replicate this? Who's got it?

280
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,370
Fifty shares and covered call. No, no.

281
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,990
Because you're still going to have all that downside risk.

282
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,600
But you're getting there. You're getting there. Sell shares and buy calls.

283
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,720
So if we sell shares and buy a call, what does that replicate?

284
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,760
Mark was saying sell, share, buy calls. What does that replicate? Who's got it?

285
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,020
OK, here we got the answer for this one. We're going to get there in a second.

286
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,930
Really good one. Beautiful, Chris. Sell shares, buy call equals call option.

287
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,940
Sorry, put option. Right. Let's just do that super quick.

288
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:21,600
Buy shares or sorry, sell shares.

289
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,730
So shares.

290
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,660
There it is. Let's buy a call.

291
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,000
Voila. We have a put option. OK,

292
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,140
what's the difference between a call and a put?

293
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,070
Shares. Synthetics. OK, so Harry, Harry hit it on the head here.

294
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,030
How can we replicate this? Well, let's look at it, guys. What is this?

295
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,300
What is that right there? That's a call option.

296
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,730
What's this right here?

297
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,140
That's a put option. OK, so how do we replicate this? We buy shares,

298
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,100
sell a call, buy a put. OK, let's do it. Right. So market makers, right.

299
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,680
How market makers will do it is you'll come in with an order.

300
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,260
Let's say you buy a vertical spread and the market maker will see that vertical

301
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,720
spread and he's going to try to replicate it somehow some other way.

302
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,220
And he's going to try to replicate it cheaper, create cheaper,

303
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
sell to you for more.

304
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,460
Let's take a look here by the shares.

305
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,010
OK, there we go. We're going to sell a call.

306
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,890
All right. There we go. And we're going to buy a put.

307
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,530
And there we go, guys. Look at that.

308
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,550
Our vertical spread.

309
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:40,380
And Koa had the other one. He said, brilliant. You sell the put spread. OK,

310
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,940
I've seen this so many times where people say, hey,

311
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:49,130
I'm going to sell a put spread because I collect a credit. OK,

312
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,010
I'm going to sell a put spread because I get to collect the credit.

313
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
And I say to them, well, would you buy the debit spread?

314
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,040
It's the same thing. So I got the strikes a little messed up there,

315
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,260
but same thing. And I asked them, I said, hey, well, why not?

316
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,310
Why not buy the why not buy the debit spread? And they say,

317
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,590
I like collecting the credit. Right. I saw this on GME. OK,

318
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,710
there was a guy on Twitter. Not going to mention any names. Pretty popular.

319
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,690
And he said, Jimmy, his name is Darren, by the way.

320
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,840
He said, listen, he said, listen, Jimmy, borrow rate is insane.

321
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,190
So to collect that borrow rate,

322
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:40,330
I'm going to sell a put in the money put spread because I'm bullish on Delta and

323
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,210
they want to collect that borrow rate. And someone asked him, like, hey,

324
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,810
why don't you just buy the call spread? And he said,

325
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,970
I want to collect the borrow rate, is what he said.

326
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,720
That borrow rate is going to be baked into that call option just because it's a

327
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,150
debit outlay. Right. The trade is identical.

328
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,660
And that debit outlay makes people queasy. It gets them a little excited.

329
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,920
They don't they don't like paying that debit. However, it is identical.

330
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,260
Always remember that, guys. What's the difference between a call and a put?

331
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,520
Shares.

332
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,880
Right. So of course,

333
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,620
saying I like I like the put spread because I can get assigned the shares.

334
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,460
And I think, you know,

335
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,440
selling selling an out of the money put is going to be better than buying a covered

336
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,480
call in the money. Right. So and that's, I guess,

337
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,040
for some microstructure reasons. It's not a huge difference.

338
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,220
It might cost you five cents because the market maker is not quoting it in the money

339
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,060
option.

340
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,940
But, you know, or if you don't like the hassle of, let's say,

341
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,500
moving the positions around and you just wanted to get exercise, you know,

342
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,720
that's another reason why Coalmite is saying here.

343
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,200
I like those out of the money put options because if I get assigned,

344
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,800
I get the shares. I don't have to worry about doing anything else.

345
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,820
But they are the same thing. No difference.

346
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,120
Yeah. You know, is that margin seeing SPX is a margin. Are you SPX 4000?

347
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,780
Who's SPX 4000?

348
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,360
Chig's. OK.

349
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,280
I'm not I'm not going to I'm not going to hate on these people on Twitter.

350
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,040
I'm not going to do that on a live Chig's.

351
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,640
If you want to you want to message me in private, we can have a little talk.

352
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,740
So are you guys understanding what a synthetic is?

353
00:28:52,180 --> 00:29:00,640
Any questions about the synthetics with respect to everything?

354
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,660
So, Marcos, so it's it's not. So you use them actually in a lot of places,

355
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,180
right?

356
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,340
And I'm going to break them all down for you, Marcos.

357
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,890
But there was something I wanted to say about that.

358
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,460
One that I'd like to chat about is one that would be good to chat about is for short

359
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,700
shares, you know, if you're doing like the deltas. OK,

360
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,060
so that's what we're going to say quickly before I get to their show.

361
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,260
Harry is saying, so they're the same respect to Delta.

362
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,620
They're the same in respect to everything identical. If they're not identical,

363
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,880
arbitrage,

364
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:51,440
excluding dividends and interest rate and borrow cost arbitrage. OK.

365
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,940
That has a question here saying it seems like with covered calls and callers,

366
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,760
you can take profits on dips and let them run much more flexibility.

367
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,080
So so they're identical, right?

368
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,200
The one thing that you might get from the covered call, let's say,

369
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,780
is the liquidity of the shares. So, you know,

370
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,140
you sell the call and then the stock dips and you sell another call and you're only

371
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,700
trading that call. And if you're going to trade the shares,

372
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,540
they're more liquid. But if you're doing this on, let's say,

373
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,580
NASDAQ or S&P or like any liquid names, there's going to be zero difference.

374
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:38,150
And if there wasn't arbitrage. OK, if there wasn't a difference,

375
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,160
you could arbit. So liquidity aside, they are the same.

376
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,100
And for for liquid names, they're going to be the same.

377
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,100
So, yeah, something like ARK or Buzz,

378
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,160
you can get extra liquidity by buying the shares and then selling, let's say,

379
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,060
an out of the money call instead of selling it in the money put.

380
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,080
So that's a good point, right? OK, so let's get back to Marcos here.

381
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,440
So where would you use them? OK, so a few places, Marcos.

382
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,120
Let's say you want to short shares. You want to short Hertz,

383
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,940
but you can't short Hertz.

384
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,960
You can't short Jimmy because your brokerage won't give them to you. Well,

385
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,720
you can come into the option market and create those short shares. Right.

386
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,540
I'm going to I'm going to buy a put and I'm going to sell a call. Same strike.

387
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,520
OK, so now I don't need to worry about there being no short shares available.

388
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,860
I can just create it. I can just create it myself.

389
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,390
Now, usually, Marcos,

390
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,890
what you're going to find is the borrower rates are extremely high on stocks that

391
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,550
have are hard to borrow.

392
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,820
And so usually this you're going to be paying a debit for these trades.

393
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,300
But it's exactly the same. Sometimes you can are the borrower rate, right?

394
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,220
If the borrower rate in the shares is, let's say,

395
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:07,840
X and the borrower rate implied in the in the option is why we can make the arbitrage.

396
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,660
Just like if the dividend is going to be a dollar,

397
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,030
but the implied dividend from the options is five dollars arbitrage.

398
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,910
Let's see how many times I can say arbitrage. Tonight's five, guys.

399
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,730
All right. So that is the that's one way you would use them.

400
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,390
Another way you would use the Marcos is let's say you want to take an earnings trade,

401
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,510
but the trade's too big, right? You're doing an Amazon or Tesla earnings trade.

402
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,730
It's too big. You can't even do a one lot.

403
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,200
You can't even do the one lot, Marcos. It's too it's too big, let's say.

404
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,940
Let's say I remember when I was doing Amazon one time. It's too big.

405
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,210
I couldn't do it. So I said, OK, this is too much for me.

406
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,560
I'm going to do a half lot. Well, how do you do a half lot?

407
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,260
You're going to buy a call.

408
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,690
You're going to buy a call.

409
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,400
Analyze that trade. And you're going to short 50 shares.

410
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,290
So now we have a position on that's a straddle,

411
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,970
but it's half because it's a half lot. It's half the position of a one lot.

412
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,610
So that's another place you would use them.

413
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,210
You would also use them if they're a market maker would use them if they're he's

414
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,950
trying to replicate something. So you come in, for example, Marcos,

415
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,310
with a vertical spread. The market maker says, OK, well,

416
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:45,560
I can actually create that exact same spread through shares and calls and puts for

417
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,310
10 cents less. So I'm going to create it.

418
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,350
I'm going to sell you this for 10 cents more.

419
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,630
So that's where market maker would use it, right?

420
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,270
They're using it all the time, creating synthetics all the time.

421
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,430
Trying to get a few pennies here, a few pennies there,

422
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,280
thousands of times a day. OK, so that's where he's going to do it.

423
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,240
Let me think where else you would use it.

424
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,700
A lot of people use it for covered calls.

425
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,110
Let me think where else people would use these.

426
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,240
OK, here's a good one. We use it all the time, guys.

427
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:28,200
We use this one all the time for liquidity reasons. Who knows which one it is?

428
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,720
Who knows which one it is? This is a really thinking one.

429
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,720
Who is saying reversal? No.

430
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,490
What's the synthetic you guys use at PA all the time? Synthetic option callers?

431
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,410
Nope.

432
00:34:53,030 --> 00:35:01,630
What is it? OK, it is a iron condor or we call it an iron condor,

433
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,490
even though it's an iron fly. Right. That's a synthetic. So here I go.

434
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,710
I'm going to create this iron condor.

435
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,860
So 665, 665.

436
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,740
And then I want someone else to tell me how I can create this another way.

437
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,830
So here is the standard PA IC iron condor.

438
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:38,080
But what this is a synthetic what it's a synthetic butterfly. Exactly.

439
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,130
I can recreate this exact same structure by buying a butterfly.

440
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,920
Now, the reason why I like to do the IC is because we're not in the money.

441
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,470
So sometimes liquidity can be terrible and the market maker might want an extra

442
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,620
few, few more cents for you going in the money. Same trade.

443
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah, exactly. There's like you can create two vertical spreads.

444
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,420
You can create just so many ways.

445
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,710
But this is a iron condor that we talk about.

446
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,370
PA iron fly is the same as a butterfly.

447
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,140
OK. So that's one way.

448
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,480
Another way that we use the Marcos is to get a little bit extra liquidity on the

449
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,680
out of the money options instead of going in the money.

450
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:49,450
Yeah. So usually Marcos in the money options are slightly less illiquid. OK,

451
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,930
that being said, you should honestly be getting the same price, you know,

452
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,070
but sometimes you can get, you know, you can get a couple of cents.

453
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,250
The market maker wants an extra five cents in the money there.

454
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,310
The other issue is, especially when we're creating PA,

455
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:14,780
is having beginners trade in the money legs is probably not a great idea,

456
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,960
right? You know,

457
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,220
you don't need to get a little fishy when a little strange when it comes into expiration.

458
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:29,220
So, you know, that's another reason why we stayed away with those.

459
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,780
But they're really the same thing, Marcos. There's no real big difference.

460
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,180
There's no efficiency in terms of buying power.

461
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,660
OK, so that is the live on synthetics.

462
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,100
What's the difference between call and put? Shares.

463
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,000
And the difference between a covered call and an in the money short put?

464
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,620
Nothing. Nothing.

465
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,320
And the difference between the wheel and selling it in the money put and out of

466
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,460
the money put and in the money put is nothing. So, you know,

467
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,300
always be aware of that, guys. Whenever you see someone say,

468
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,390
I like some covered calls and you say, well,

469
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,190
what do you think about selling short put for margin efficiency?

470
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,800
And they say because of the dividends or because of max risk,

471
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,630
you can write them off right away.

472
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,330
Is there a way to synthetically replicate a caller?

473
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,740
Yes. So the caller is the vertical spread, right? Buy the shares,

474
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,720
sell the call, buy the put.

475
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,970
Same thing as a vertical spread or call spread or a short put spread.

476
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,700
And then same things. Harry had a question here. He's saying,

477
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,700
can you walk me through why you're only shorting 50 shares to replicate the straddle?

478
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,290
Is it because the delta of an at the money call? Yes.

479
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,370
But you're going to delta neutral. You're going to do neutral.

480
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,450
Just like you're just like a straddle itself.

481
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:19,940
And Marco's saying, so is there a Marco's? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. OK, OK.

482
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,820
Is there is there an argument?

483
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,830
He asked it earlier as well,

484
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:30,660
because a lot of companies were suspending their dividend this year. Yeah. So,

485
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,300
Marco, what do you.

486
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,800
Yeah. So there could be. Right. You have Sean. No,

487
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,880
it's funny when you're talking to Mike. I don't know if it's on my end,

488
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,480
but you cut off. You break up like you'll be like,

489
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,720
I'll hear like five words and then three words gone and then five words come back

490
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,810
in later. Yeah. Or do you guys do that as well? Yeah, that's only me.

491
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:05,330
Oh, it's me, maybe. And OK. Interesting. You always end. No, no.

492
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,030
They're saying they break off. Sounds like, ha, ha, ha, ha.

493
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,860
OK. I mean, Ryan. OK, Marcos.

494
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:21,470
So it's all about what's implied in the options market and versus what happens.

495
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,610
So here's an example.

496
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:30,740
Imagine you you remember when when General Electric was given like a four percent

497
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,440
dividend and they cut all their dividends. I don't know if you remember that.

498
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:42,050
Well, the two year options were implying dividends for two years.

499
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,370
OK, because G is so stable.

500
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,730
Who would not think that they're going to cut their who think they cut their dividends?

501
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,420
They've been paying them for 50 years. So what you could imagine you knew that,

502
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,770
Marcos, imagine you knew that G was going to cut their dividend. Well,

503
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,890
you could buy General Electric and short that synthetic.

504
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,690
And then once General Electric cuts its dividend,

505
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,890
you're going to make all that money in that dividend.

506
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,350
In that from that from those options,

507
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:19,670
from those implied dividends being taken away from the options. OK, no,

508
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,920
it would be instant. Right. If if G says, hey, I'm cutting my dividends. Well,

509
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,510
there's no more dividends. So they're gone. It's instant.

510
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,950
It's instant right away. Now, that being said,

511
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:38,250
sometimes we're not instant inefficiency arbitrage, right?

512
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:43,540
You'd want to price the synthetic pre you know,

513
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,320
pre announcement of cutting dividends and then post announcement and see what happened.

514
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,310
Is it still implying a dividend? If it is, make it happen, right?

515
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,200
How would you structure it, Tico? You would just sell,

516
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,640
sell it in the money call. Sorry. So same strike call and a put and buy a put.

517
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,120
Right. You just create the synthetic shares.

518
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,030
So here you're saying realistically, why would there be an ARB in that case?

519
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,690
You're not going to find out about the dividend before the price is in. No.

520
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:26,690
And yes, yes.

521
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,030
The market is almost always almost always is usually very efficient. So,

522
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:36,510
of course, you're going to be pricing it. But there's a dividend risk premium.

523
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,560
Right.

524
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:44,920
Imagine how could a five year option imply five years of dividend from IBM?

525
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,510
Isn't there a risk that IBM stopped paying dividends? Of course.

526
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:57,390
So for that reason, the dividends are not fully going to be priced in, right?

527
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,780
Because of that, because of the risk that, you know,

528
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,600
IBM doesn't give their dividends or doesn't increase their dividends.

529
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,450
So that's just a risk premium. It's not an inefficiency.

530
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,980
What do you guys think? If that's no more questions,

531
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,170
we'll we will leave it there.

532
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,280
Looks like that's it.

533
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,190
OK.

534
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,450
Marcos, great seeing you out here. We've got one more.

535
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,070
Marcos is down in Mexico still, I wonder. OK, where's Red? Oh, for sure he is.

536
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,670
He'll come back. I guess we'll already come back. Red's saying, he's saying,

537
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,370
can't the top of that put credit spread get called away from being in the money?

538
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,070
For sure. But if it does get called away, how amazing would that be? Right.

539
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,570
It's another thing I see a lot of the time. People say, like,

540
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,840
I'm worried about assignment. I'm worried about assignment.

541
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,700
If you short a call or short a short put and it gets assigned.

542
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,280
All that extrinsic value is yours straight to straight to the bank. Right.

543
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:29,900
So if I ever got called away on on anything short with extrinsic value in it,

544
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:37,000
I mean, it's a it's a great day. It's a great day. Red,

545
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,280
if you want to look a little more into that,

546
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,540
you can check out the live archive. We have a video on it.

547
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,900
Just look up early assignment. Like just control go to the archive.

548
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,020
Control F early assignment should come up.

549
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,940
Yeah, right. Great questions, man. Keep them coming.

550
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,150
I'd love to see you on the live man. Good stuff. You know,

551
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,770
you're keeping the keeping the lives fun to come out, too. So keep it up, man.

552
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,950
OK, we'll see you guys on the next one.
