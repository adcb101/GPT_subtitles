1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,940
All right,

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,280
everyone welcome to a another lecture here from the PA household Today we're gonna

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,780
be talking about pre-releases the impact they have on so what they are and the impact

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,220
they have on earnings as well as a trade structure that Pranav and Hutch and Parth

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,900
and Parth also took for this trade right how they How they interpreted the information

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,280
and then how they acted on it.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,760
So First we're gonna start off by saying a Pre-release.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,650
Okay is when a company comes out and announces their earnings before the event Okay

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,510
so an example micron has earnings tonight, but Three weeks ago.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,470
They come out and say This is what we're expecting to get for our earnings release

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,330
date. Okay, we are updating our guidance Okay,

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,020
what we're going to get for this earnings report And now we need to remember why

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,000
That might cut vol down. Okay, and of course,

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,200
we're gonna go into the website We're gonna show you what the pre-release looks

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,180
like But why would this or what impact should this have right and we need to think

16
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,380
about what an earnings event is Okay,

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,890
an earnings event is where new information comes into the market Okay That allows

18
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,600
us to price the company more efficiently Okay,

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,880
it allows us to price it more efficiently because now we have more earnings information

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,320
right a company in the long run,

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:38,470
okay In the long run is going to be based around its earnings Okay Or future earnings

22
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,990
for example Tesla, right? This is all future earnings, right?

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,250
It's trading at this because in the future one day They're expected to make hundreds

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,880
of billions of dollars Okay So a company like micron right where the earnings are

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,680
a little more stable,

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,320
right the company's really gonna follow like Walmart For example,

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,020
right at the high extreme or coca-cola It's not going to deviate from its price

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,220
to earnings right if you graphed out its price to earnings It would it wouldn't

29
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,560
deviate too much from it. Okay, something like Tesla.

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,760
There's no real value there. It's all future value.

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Okay It's all extrinsic not intrinsic. Right, right. So but with micron,

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:18,940
you know,

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,000
we should see You know If a company comes out and real pre releases its earnings,

34
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,700
right and the company,

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,240
you know most of the companies at least follow these earnings then once that information

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,800
is out we can price it right now and Vol will drop Okay,

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,700
because now the information is out So it's not like the company's gonna come out

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,800
on the earnings day and say we're making Something way different and now the company

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,760
needs to price that in.

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,350
So I guess a question to start off with is What changes should you see in the option

41
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,680
chain? Right company has earnings coming up.

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,980
What changes should you see in the options if a company comes out and pre-releases?

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:12,680
Do you see Pranav stop stop trolling man.

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,360
So Pranav said Vega should tank but it won't Part the saying drop in future vol

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,220
vol should drop. Yeah, exactly. Let's so let's think about this, right?

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,560
Let's say we're looking at a timeline here wasn't this was not very dark. Yeah,

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,160
let's say we're looking at a timeline All right.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,090
Let's say earnings releases here. And let's say this is a Daily vol. All right,

49
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,550
the market will probably be pricing daily vol to look something like this,

50
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,480
right?

51
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,540
now we're moving through time and at this point in time the company comes out and

52
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,730
Gives their earnings right here.

53
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,010
They give their forecast for the earnings like hey,

54
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,050
this is what we're expecting How should this line change?

55
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,510
What do you guys think?

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,340
It'll be an uneven boob Okay, yeah,

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,960
so Eric saying it should flatten right should should go down right so maybe we'll

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
end up with a line like this,

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,170
right Where yeah same as here and this maybe comes down a lot still maybe a little

60
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,920
bit because maybe still a little bit of uncertainty But you should see it Or yeah,

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,500
and even maybe a little bump here, right? That's the uneven boob that oh,

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,940
this is implied vol. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha.

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,990
Yeah You'd have realized vol at the moment, right? So yeah,

64
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,690
if we graphed realized vol you'd be like this All right,

65
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:54,630
and now we have the uneven boobs so This is this is what this is what happened with

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,090
that earnings right the company pre-released and so we got some information So let's

67
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,820
actually dig in and see what it looks like Mm-hmm.

68
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,300
Are you sure in the terminal?

69
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,310
Yes, the terminal The terminal. Okay.

70
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:26,330
Give me one second guys Give me a moment.

71
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,720
Oh I'll show it to you guys both in investor relations and on the terminal just

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,600
so you guys can be aware of What look or yeah,

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,850
what a pre-release looks like Okay, it's very important.

74
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,710
Just give me one second guys.

75
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,390
This is and a lot of the times At least what we saw micron a lot of times it's not

76
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,580
being fully priced in Right,

77
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,030
and so if it's not fully priced in Or at least in the vol right,

78
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:05,150
it's not fully pricing in the vol we can Then we can make some money, you know,

79
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:16,260
I did. Let's see Okay, here it is. Okay, so let's go to Okay,

80
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,350
so if you come to the if you come to the terminal Okay,

81
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,970

They came in and they said They gave a whole report on on Their new estimate of

85
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,210

89
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,750
is a very rare thing that happens For earnings so that and that's why when you do

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,670
find them, they're usually really good to act on.

91
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:13,570
Okay,

92
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:21,740

and this is where they go over What they're expecting to happen. Okay,

99
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,880
so yeah when we look at this, right?

100
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,170
What are the couple of things that people should be looking for in this report if

101
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,550
they wanted to spend the time to read it? What gives you edge here, right?

102
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,610
Is it future guidance? Is it next quarter's earnings?

103
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,430
What would they what do they want to look for and you you want to look for revenue

104
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,690
and earnings per share? Okay,

105
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,010
so you can see right here today announced or in and let's say this is where the

106
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,410
real alpha comes in is Certain companies will act to certain things.

107
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,610
So for example with Netflix,

108
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,630
you know Knowing the earnings per share knowing the revenue is gonna be good.

109
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,070
But what really matters with Netflix is the net Subscription count how many more

110
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,380
people came in then people went out, right? So that's really important So,

111
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,060
you know as you get better with these trades like depending on how specialized you

112
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,800
want to get with earnings You can you know,

113
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,560
you just become better and better and better and start looking for things specific

114
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,360
to the company Well,

115
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,740
what is really gonna cut down the vol or what's gonna increase the vol, right?

116
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,350
So and in pronounced case is there gonna be a is there some Delta bet to write what

117
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,850
you know You guys can reach out to put off.

118
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,870
He wrote a really good article about it okay,

119
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,890
so today today announced that it is increasing its revenue gross margin and EPS

120
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,180
guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 Okay,

121
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,840
which ends December 3rd 2020.

122
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,860
So they are giving us revenue gross margin and earnings per share guidance one month

123
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,490
before the earnings event 30 days before the earnings event.

124
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,830
We're getting all of this right,

125
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,740
and so You're gonna have you got to stop that yeah,

126
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,040
we're gonna we're gonna block you here,

127
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:45,040
okay So this is what we're looking for right is there some type of information on

128
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,260
earnings per share revenue and guidance and You know in this case profit margin

129
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,240
right gross margin.

130
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,550
Each company's gonna be different each company's gonna be you know,

131
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,340
yeah Really really dependent on on the specific company,

132
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,920
right if we see Tesla come out with earnings per share guys We don't really care

133
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,680
about that But we care about is how many cars they're selling or what's the new

134
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,700
and what is the new industry that they're trying to get?

135
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,340
Into right that's really gonna drop vol because on a Tesla announcement.

136
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,520
It's not what they have It's what Elon says they're gonna have is what is gonna

137
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,300
drive the vol, right? So if he already says hey guys,

138
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,040
we're coming up with this battery thing.

139
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,120
We're gonna be talking about it on our earnings day Well now that's gonna drop vol

140
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,830
substantially as it's already being built in to the price or it should So in this

141
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,210
case what we do is right we find out okay, well,

142
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,000
you know They gave us quite a bit of information here.

143
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:47,250
And this is severely gonna impact realized vol but what we noticed was What we noticed

144
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,260
with micron is that so okay So here's the thing right implied move 5.8 average implied

145
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,820
7.3.

146
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,260
So the markets already pricing this lower right average move 7% And you can see

147
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,240
right vol has been coming in so we can look at let's say applied move So you can

148
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,140
see like it's near the lows, right? So people aren't stupid.

149
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,900
They're coming in They swing they're seeing this information and they're acting

150
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:19,520
on it, right and they're dropping that vol They're dropping that volatility,

151
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,120
right? So as a trader, we have to understand that okay,

152
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,840
the markets can be efficient most of time But you know what?

153
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,080
They probably didn't drop vol enough All right,

154
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,740
they didn't drop volatility enough. So for that reason, you know,

155
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,540
we were able to come in and why I didn't come in but many of the guys in the group

156
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,420
came in and Decide to sell some volatility.

157
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,380
So how would you know if it's enough? Yeah,

158
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,810
that's a That's a really good point there You know what?

159
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,910
And I honestly don't think there's there's a hard rule for that It's depending on

160
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,630
how much information they're gonna give out So in this case if they get out the

161
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,500
gross margin the earnings per share and the revenue You should expect vol to drop

162
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,660
substantially maybe 50% of what realized volatility should be right in this case

163
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,300
It's it's trading at 6% implied Averages at 7.2.

164
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,840
Like it definitely didn't come down enough, right?

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,540
And so for that reason I would always be taking that trade except for today.

166
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:27,650
I was a little busy doing some other stuff He was napping at the close So that is

167
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,630
That's what the pre-release is.

168
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,870
You guys have any questions about the pre-release?

169
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:48,520
Otherwise, we're gonna jump into the structure Okay Okay Awesome,

170
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,870
so we're gonna go into the structure of the trade. Oh Shoot.

171
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,110
I don't want you doing this.

172
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:02,160
I have no clue You're not a bunch of Is there any way to predict pre-releases?

173
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,440
Not that I know of Not that I know of right a lot of the company's gonna do it in

174
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,920
a different situation So for example,

175
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,300
a company might do it because their earnings are gonna be so bad right,

176
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,680
they're gonna be so so bad and they don't want this big one day to come and the

177
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,340
Company gets cut in half. So they're gonna release or it's so good, right?

178
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,020
The the release is just so good that they're going to uh help help give guidance

179
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,500
or Um in like, you know scenario like this, for example,

180
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,820
it's there's it's really hard to figure out How much this company's gonna make?

181
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,830
Because of kovat, right?

182
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,130
Maybe maybe their volatility of their returns is a lot higher And so for that reason

183
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,140
The company might come out and say well, you know what? Okay,

184
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,080
we're gonna help guide our investors and give them a little bit of information as

185
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:04,830
we get closer Okay um so Let us initiate a screen Let's take a look here Okay,

186
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,190
so let's see what happened to micron So pancake right big old-fashioned pancake.

187
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:11,970
Uh,

188
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,690
looks like it's going to open up around 80 um but uh Let's take a look at the structure

189
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:26,470
Okay so What we could have so the stock was trading at 79 per nav was slightly bullish

190
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,230
But we're going to stick with the 79s for now that that's the position he took That

191
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,610
is so the stock's trading was trading at 79, right?

192
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,470
So we want to look at 79 strike Okay, and this is this is our main trade,

193
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:44,450
right? Our main trade is this Selling the straddle. Okay.

194
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,230
Sean talked about it on the live today if you guys want to go and revisit that Here's

195
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,450
our main trade now,

196
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,030
you know with these earnings trades the thing can get cut in half So it's usually

197
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:59,430
prudent to go out and buy wings And I actually didn't uh suggest selling the straddle.

198
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,710
Uh, I wasn't aware of the pre-release And I forgot to do the research for it.

199
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,790
So I was actually saying lean long ball potentially. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha.

200
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,830
Gotcha Well, thank god.

201
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,850
No one did because I actually didn't show I showed like a one three two in a vertical.

202
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,650
Oh, nice Nice. So I saved my ass. Yeah, we got Okay, so,

203
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,600
um The straddle is trading at six dollars I'm probably going to go out 10 to 15

204
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,840
dollars out for my wings And I want to make sure that i'm not i'm not going to pay

205
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,220
too much, right? So one way to do that is first. This is our main.

206
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,340
This is our core position, right?

207
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,480
The first thing we want to do is stress the position what's going to happen tomorrow

208
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,040
after the announcement,

209
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,320
right and we can see here Let's go to the pa terminal All right,

210
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,260
we go to the volume sites We can see that Tomorrow volatility should open up at

211
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,730
around 41 for the 10-day options Okay, you can see that through the blue line.

212
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,150
This is the non-event volatility, right?

213
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,960
Let's quickly go over what's happening there This is just the implied vol over the

214
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,760
the different days to expiration and then what we do is we take out the event vol

215
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,790
So this is if there was no earnings There was no earnings vol would look like this

216
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,730
Because there is earnings they look like this relative to each other.

217
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,470
So we're trading the 10-day We should see vol go down from 64 event passes vol should

218
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,210
go down to around 41 So we got to drop vol 23 points here okay,

219
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,030
so We're gonna drop vol 23 points Okay,

220
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,550
we're gonna move time one day So here's what the straddle should look like tomorrow,

221
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,110
right? now you know Uh in this position,

222
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:39,150
right we're going to be making anywhere between you know 1700 You know 1700 and

223
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,430
and 2500, right? So what we want to do is really just offset.

224
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,490
We're going to spend some of that and offset it. Um By buying some wings,

225
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,250
right?

226
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,140
so something maybe like And these wings are going to be worthless tomorrow Right.

227
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:03,440
So if we go let's say 12 out, right? We'll go with the 91 91 and we go 12 down.

228
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:13,020
That's 67 So we'll pay 71 cents for these wings And now here is what our trade looks

229
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,620
like Okay And so I think this is the trade that most of you guys have on Hutch has

230
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,330
something different is a strangle in the back Right.

231
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,510
This is what this is the trade per nav has for tomorrow.

232
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:29,670
So You should be making more than a dollar per nav tomorrow 100 bucks Okay Should

233
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,230
be making a little bit more than a hundred dollars tomorrow,

234
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,410
buddy Hopefully between 150 and 200 if you don't uh,

235
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:43,090
if you don't mess this one Okay So roasted this is This is um,

236
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,950
this is the trade structure and you guys can see um You know why we structured like

237
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,270
this, right? Why we're buying the wings.

238
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,290
We're not buying the wings for edge Right.

239
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,070
We're buying the wings just to protect ourself here And we have to make sure that

240
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,270
we're not we're not we're not going to pay too much for these right?

241
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,050
And in fact if I were to do this trade structure,

242
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:06,480
I'd probably go even further out for the wings Maybe something like 93 and 65 Okay,

243
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,000
because this is just These wings are only here to help me if there's a massive blowout

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,560
in the stock market in the in the uh in the stock Maybe one we can take a look at

245
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,320
so parth actually has a different position on he has a 132 Oh nice. Okay,

246
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,520
so that actually did very well Let's take a look at it.

247
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,610
So he has the 80 84 87 1 3 2 80 84 Okay, slightly off.

248
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,320
Yeah slightly off I would uh slightly off but Okay,

249
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,420
actually that might have worked out better for him because he bought protection

250
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,600
a little Little cheaper, right? um one thing I would say Is uh,

251
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,600
if you knew about this pre-release you probably wouldn't want to be uh Structuring

252
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,400
this thing too far out of the money. Okay,

253
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,260
you want to be a little bit more at the money Is it 80 84 87?

254
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,850
I believe so Parth, can you compare can you uh, just confirm in the chat?

255
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,050
Can we do this?

256
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,680
Okay. Yeah, we're all good. Nice All right. So,

257
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,450
uh this one so this should work out very nice, right?

258
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:27,470
We got uh Look at that Good job Nice right so this should this should print.

259
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,510
Yeah, you know, this should pay off pretty good tomorrow um,

260
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,670
and you're probably gonna get some drop and skew as well,

261
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:40,010
right so You're risking, you know 60 bucks All right, it's gonna pay out huge.

262
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:47,470
Yeah, right. He's gonna pay out huge man Yeah, the only thing that uh So yeah,

263
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,870
you didn't have a lot of risk on this trade. Um, however,

264
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,830
you did have this blow up potential, right?

265
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,310
um I probably wish I had the huge risk on the other side Yeah,

266
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,450
I buy the structures a little bit different buddy. Uh,

267
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,470
maybe something like this, right?

268
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:08,020
Maybe something like buying the 79 um Buying the 79 this is knowing about the pre

269
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,360
-release. Yeah.

270
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,830
Yeah knowing about the pre-release And even if you do know about the pre-release,

271
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,610
it's not very margin efficient to do those,

272
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:30,030
uh broken wings Mm-hmm So maybe done something like this Maybe I probably bring

273
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,290
it in a little bit closer actually maybe something around probably actually the

274
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:39,420
84 sounds or 80 Maybe 83 sounds reasonable. That's four and 285.

275
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah And it doesn't line up Okay, that's okay. Um,

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,620
and if I did know about the pre-release and I was bullish in pranav's,

277
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,820
um Like pranav was I actually would have structured something like this Where my

278
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,400
body would have been maybe let's say 81 And I would have bought let's say, uh,

279
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,860
the 69 so it would look something like this Right,

280
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,180
you can you can structure these trades.

281
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,870
It would be a one-two-one fly right an iron condor same thing um The way I would

282
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,530
structure these is you want to lean in the direction you think the stock is going

283
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,510
to go and You can be short vol okay,

284
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:37,110
so something like this 69 81 and uh 93 Okay for six bucks Right and this You guys

285
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,180
can see here Okay, it's probably gonna pay out the most tomorrow At inception.

286
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:54,850
Let me drop vol here so we can see what we are at inception Okay,

287
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,150
it's a little off But anyways,

288
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,750
you guys can see here that we are long delta at inception, right?

289
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,170
We want the stock to go To go up.

290
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm, not too sure why it's like that,

291
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,280
but this is what it looks like at inception Okay,

292
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,740
and because it went up Right or the stock was over here.

293
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,760
Remember the stock was right over here So if it goes up slightly And vol drops this

294
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,930
is going to pay out huge Right,

295
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,640
so this would be a pin fly in the morning wants to see This is uh before we drop

296
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,600
the vol right? Yeah, this is before we drop the vol Uh,

297
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:41,290
once we drop the vol eric It would look like this in the morning Right where okay

298
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,910
now we're gonna make money if it pins at 81.

299
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,150
We're gonna make the most money at 81, right?

300
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:54,540
so these are um Being short vol and leaning deltas in uh in the direction you want

301
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:04,970
to be Do you when you're trading earnings you usually do a quick scan to see if

302
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,550
there's a pre-release? Um,

303
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,890
I think we always do that Like if i'm going really really hard in the paint on earnings

304
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,730
like if i'm really in the zone Then you're always i'm always right if i'm like saying,

305
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,310
okay, i'm gonna be doing an earnings. Um,

306
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,220
uh An earnings rotation in my book and i'm gonna be spending as much time as I can

307
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,320
on this strategy Then you know i'll be basically in the zone every single day trying

308
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,300
to figure out as much information trading in the zone Yeah,

309
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:36,300
reading all the reports, uh, really trying to figure it out Uh parth,

310
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,700
can you just clarify your question?

311
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,720
He's like if the implied move is six percent you're um,

312
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,700
uh uh You're expecting a five percent move. Why put it three percent away?

313
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,760
Well, if you're expecting a five percent move then that's different Right,

314
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,640
that's different. Yeah,

315
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,460
we were saying it's probably not exactly after knowing about the pre-release We

316
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,430
were saying it'll probably be less than that If you're expecting a five percent

317
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:57,650
move,

318
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,710
of course You want to you want you'd want to pin it to to wherever you think it's

319
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,210
going to move, right?

320
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,530
You want you don't put your short strike to wherever you think, uh,

321
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:13,380
it's going to move So in your case, you know That made a lot of sense.

322
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,030
The only thing I would have done differently is um Change the strike for that last

323
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,230
wing.

324
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:25,930
Yeah changes try to get just because it's not very margin efficient right um Yeah

325
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:26,950
You know,

326
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,370
maybe you know and maybe maybe it's a little bit more of a personal thing I've just

327
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,510
never been a fan of broken wing butterflies So maybe you actually take that with

328
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:42,030
a brick of salt Okay Yeah,

329
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:48,660
i'm just thinking about that He was asking why not why not why why I don't like

330
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,340
uh broken wing butterflies. Um Like so they're not very margin efficient.

331
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,110
That's the first thing I hate that massive risk to the like I hate being right in

332
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,050
direction So like this let's say the stock goes up,

333
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,270
but it goes up So much that I lose a lot of money, right?

334
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,270
Like that's the worst feeling ever. It's like You know,

335
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,160
I think apple's gonna go up And then it goes up 15 And then I lose all my money

336
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,950
Right. That's that's what I don't like doing. So, uh,

337
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,750
one three two four unbalanced flies.

338
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,530
Usually not my my cup of tea Koa says tasty trade likes to sell butterflies.

339
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,090
What do you think? Um, I think they like to buy butterflies, right?

340
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,590
They look like they they're always short vol I don't think they like to sell butterflies,

341
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,430
right? Um koa. Here's here's a short butterfly Right.

342
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,130
I'm super against being long vol and capping. Yeah capping your gains, right?

343
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:48,020
You're buying vol for that reason of a potential blowout Right. Why? Uh,

344
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,540
why why cap your gains? Are you just kind of saying?

345
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm kind of nervous about it. Like don't be in the long ball position. Yeah,

346
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,680
like what?

347
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,050
So but with regards to uh, you know tasty trade liking to sell vol right?

348
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,630
Let's say sell an iron condor there's nothing wrong with selling an iron condor

349
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,760
it's like but the thing we always talk about is like If you you should be selling

350
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,900
it if you think vol is expensive,

351
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,440
but expensive is relative to fair price Tasty trade doesn't offer a way for you

352
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,850
to determine fair value Right.

353
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:24,360
That's why that's why you have the terminal And that's why this is special And uh

354
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,720
koa they they sell iron flies, yeah,

355
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,760
it's a synthetic it's like what we call an iron condor.

356
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:38,010
Um I was gonna say something about uh about that, but now I forget Okay,

357
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,390
so part saying you know this you know because of that pre-release he was feeling

358
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,470
you know A lot safer about doing the broken wing. Gotcha, right?

359
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,170
So he's still in case,

360
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,730
you know He wanted to have the directional risk and then cap it to the downside

361
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,750
his risk But he was totally okay being exposed to the upside. Gotcha. Gotcha.

362
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,390
I would more exposure to the upside. Gotcha.

363
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,910
Gotcha Um because he was already biased in that way So it's like a his break-even

364
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,390
was already he already had a like a break-even to the upside that was pretty far,

365
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,150
you know Yeah, that makes some sense. Yeah. Yeah,

366
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,350
that's reasonable You just have to embrace that risk. Yeah,

367
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,430
I might I might have done a butterfly man and put the I just might have Done a one

368
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,170
a one two one and put the wings really far and just put it at your strike.

369
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:26,670
So it's maybe something like uh, 75 um 75 You said 83 was it is where you 80?

370
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,280
84 87 Okay,

371
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,430
so something I would have done something like this buddy Does not trade it here

372
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:56,230
Maybe something like this Right where you're still short a ton of vol and uh You

373
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,770
know if you get that rally to pin strike right you're you're making money uh in

374
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,450
a huge way,

375
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,070
um In multiple different levels That's probably what I would have done just out

376
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,610
of the money one two one balance fly So marcos is asking.

377
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,910
Um What he is not getting very well is that is the strategy you're you're like implementing

378
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,610
All the way until the earnings from the pre-release to the earnings.

379
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,100
Is there anything to do in between there? You could um marcos 100 man,

380
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,510
I mean What you could do is this right actually so before you hop into that to clarify

381
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,510
So marcos what we're saying here is this was a normal earnings trade Maybe we were

382
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,710
just looking at like a normal earnings trade and we noticed that there was the pre

383
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:41,630
-release All right now Because of that and we looked at it and vol was still high

384
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,030
We were saying being even though um You know,

385
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,230
it was slightly below the average move.

386
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,060
It wasn't a ton below it And we were saying it's still too expensive and having

387
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,060
that pre-release there. It should move a lot less No problem marcos. But uh,

388
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,140
maybe that's worth an idea worth talking about. Uh,

389
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,920
since we have we still have a few minutes here um to marcos,

390
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,540
you know to maybe go down that rabbit hole is uh If we see the pre-release today

391
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,680
and earnings is in a month, let's say or in two weeks What can we do? Yeah,

392
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,560
I'd probably get short vol right the market right away right away, right?

393
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,740
Because we know eventually the market's going to price it in right you can see here.

394
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,880
So if you go to the Would you be able to see in the earnings tab the vol drop off

395
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,400
right away? Uh, if it does so look what happened to thing here, right? Yeah,

396
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,060
could you could you rely on uh, Like could you rely on this number changing?

397
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,940
Yes, you almost certainly could right? Uh,

398
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,440
and if it doesn't then you know that hasn't priced it in yet, right? Right.

399
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,620
So you look at the average move or the average implied and see where it's different

400
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,540
So check this out marcos,

401
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,650
right december 1st the news came out Right around here Okay,

402
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,410
right around when it was still seven percent implying Okay,

403
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:56,510
and it took literally like five days For or sorry almost a month, right?

404
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,390
It's only around jan 5th where people started saying This thing's not gonna move.

405
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,350
Yeah, wait a minute, but maybe around jan 5th, let's say or even let's say,

406
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,310
you know around christmas time People started looking at earnings for micron now,

407
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,530
right? Okay now, you know,

408
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,470
I just finished my earning cycle It's time to move into the next cycle And microns

409
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,650
on my list and now the market makers are really looking at micron and now they're

410
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,690
saying oh this thing pre-release Let's drop balls off right,

411
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,210
but If you noticed it a month ago,

412
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,590
you could have been selling ball around this Right doing a calendar spread.

413
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:33,550
Let's say Isolating that event you would have made a lot of money boatloads All

414
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,300
right, it dropped off it dropped off,

415
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,240
uh one and a half one and a half balls one and a half points Right,

416
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,080
not one and a half volts one and a half. You're still like 20 volt. Yeah,

417
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,600
this would have dropped a ton of all So that's really the topic for today guys.

418
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,020
Do we have any more questions about pre-releases?

419
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,850
And just it's just another layer to trading guys, right?

420
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,690
Like we're trying to find a real real edge right some a real source of alpha something

421
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,380
we can bet on You know,

422
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:10,150
we we're not trying to uh You know draw fancy draw fancy lines and and uh You know

423
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,910
and try to make a bet on that right?

424
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,430
We want to see some real insights and real information that the market's not that

425
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,000
the market's missing And we want to be as competitive as possible And one thing

426
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
to keep in mind guys is and like,

427
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,320
you know We should really be learning from these and not just like oh,

428
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,480
this is a good idea But also carrying into other strategies, right?

429
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,480
Think about this. These just don't happen all the time.

430
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,780
They're very rare Right, but when they do happen,

431
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,310
there's usually a good trade around them And this is another layer of how the market

432
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,910
works, right?

433
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,070
The market is for the most part efficient Right the market's for the most part efficient

434
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,350
and it tried to be efficient here,

435
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:53,510
right vols did drop But it didn't drop fast enough And it didn't drop enough Okay,

436
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,950
so these are these are like, uh small,

437
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,750
you know small wrinkles in the market that you can find right and they're not you

438
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:05,110
know You shouldn't be going you shouldn't be waking up every morning Opening up

439
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,510
your screen and saying oh my god I got found a fantastic trade,

440
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:14,530
right if that's happening something's wrong Right your strategy your idea generation

441
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,850
is wrong Okay,

442
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,930
you know every morning you might wake up and there might be a potential idea that

443
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,630
you're willing to bet on But it's not going to be a fantastic strategy, right?

444
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:28,360
And this is just another example of these things come up very rarely Okay,

445
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,700
you can build a whole strategy around this uh this thing,

446
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,710
but you're only going to take 20 trades a year 30 trades a year Right,

447
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:42,150
so it just we need to start thinking in terms of inefficiencies Right risk premia

448
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:50,800
harvesting risk premia or trading inefficiencies Okay Another quick example of one

449
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,700
I was making a trade on a stock the other day and I had to trade below intrinsic

450
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,740
And to trade below intrinsic value on expiration day to get out of the position

451
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,120
Okay for any coders out there you can now create a system that looks for these and

452
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,200
picks them up all the time Right.

453
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,940
These are wrinkles in the market where people trade below intrinsic Or you buy below

454
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,760
intrinsic. This is like the high frequency people do in this day Yeah,

455
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,520
pick that up but it was so like I was there I was sitting below intrinsic for so

456
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,960
long that it could have been picked up by just Like you didn't have to be a high

457
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,650
frequency trader. He's got to be somebody put an order in wrong There's me.

458
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,230
Yeah,

459
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,210
it was yeah I was I was trying to get out and I couldn't get filled right?

460
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,760
No one was there to provide liquidity like 50 cents under an intrinsic Right.

461
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Um,

462
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,660
that's an arbitrage So there's all these different types of strategies out there

463
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,360
that can make money But it's not every day you're going to wake up and there's it's

464
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,650
going to be there. Okay, so just keep that in mind guys Uh, no steve.

465
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,630
I had to do it because I couldn't take uh, I could not take the uh,

466
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:57,500
I could not take into expiration All right, because let's say, uh,

467
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,480
let's say one call option for example in the money Let's say just in the money on

468
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,080
micron is maybe going for 50 cents But the stock's trading at 95 Right.

469
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,460
So let's say I have 100 of those well, you know,

470
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,810
that's only What's that five grand? Or 500 bucks or no five grand.

471
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,930
Sorry in no in uh in in uh in debits,

472
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:28,900
but it's like 500 000 notional or a million notional So another question here from

473
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,840
part. Thanks for all the questions man. It's uh, this is really good. Um,

474
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,080
He said, uh,

475
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:43,380
you know With 83.54 being his upside target um you know i'm not 100 clear on it,

476
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:49,190
but uh So he's basically saying like if it moves like kind of like the average like

477
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,430
middle range of like four percent Should I be putting my uh?

478
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,130
My body right at that Okay,

479
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,970
so 83.54 being the upside target should m mu move the 5.75 Uh,

480
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,170
so so would that mean that the 71 81 91?

481
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:12,360
Would be better So that the middle is at around four percent Did you do you have

482
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
a couple drinks before this live part?

483
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,030
Yeah,

484
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,490
assuming you did your math right yeah If it moves in the direction you think right

485
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,050
don't forget the implied move number is uh,

486
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:32,640
absolute value that's up or down Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah,

487
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,220
so the implied move, uh, what was it six percent? So six percent times uh,

488
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,060
eighty dollars is 48 so 480 times Plus 79 is 80.

489
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,880
So yeah 83.54 is where the implied move is right and remember though if it's to

490
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,080
the upside That's not the market's not saying it's going to move there Right the

491
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,770
market's not saying tomorrow. This is where it's going to move Okay,

492
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,190
what the market is saying is this?

493
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:10,110
On the whiteboard. Yeah The market is saying this Here's the stock right now.

494
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:17,020
Okay And here's all the potential prices tomorrow Okay right now it's trading at

495
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:26,130
80 Okay, and here is let's say uh 84 Okay, and here's 76 Okay,

496
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,950
and these are the implied move numbers Okay, this is implied move.

497
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,090
This is down the implied move and this is up the implied move.

498
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,090
Okay What the market is saying is just is this is what the earnings should look

499
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:49,880
like With frequency being on the y-axis.

500
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,840
Yeah and frequency on the y-axis The most likely scenario is going to be an up or

501
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,180
down move around this amount Okay Now this is we're gonna get the highest probabilities.

502
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,100
The mode is going to be here right the most frequent But you know,

503
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,160
sometimes we're going to have probabilities here Sometimes we have probabilities

504
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,820
here. Sometimes we have probabilities here, right?

505
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,720
So it's still very very possible, right?

506
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:21,470
But this is just where the mode of the distribution is Okay Awesome.

507
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:37,830
Awesome Okay So so I guess that is the end of tonight's live If

508
