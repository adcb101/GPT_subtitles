00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Okay guys, welcome to a Wednesday Night Live.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,100
We're going to be chatting about valuing volatility and subsequently valuing options.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:22,120
One thing that I realized the other day was part of our core business in terms of

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,340
as a trader is value, right?

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,160
Can we find something that's cheap and can we find something that's expensive,

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,020
right? And you know, sell expensive things and buy cheap things.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,700
And if we do that over and over again,

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,760
we're going to come out ahead in the long run. Similar to, let's say,

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,560
buying a value stock, right? Everyone knows, oh, you know,

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,240
I got to buy a cheap price to earnings stock or cheap price to book. And,

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,760
you know,

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,100
eventually that's going to come back to fair value and I'm going to profit.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,280
But when it comes to the option space,

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,180
it gets maybe a little bit more tricky to understand, well,

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,160
what's expensive and what's cheap? Yeah, what's expensive and what's cheap.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,980
But we are applying the same types of concepts.

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:13,090
Where can I find options that are cheap in terms of volatility, right?

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,250
We always have to remember that options are volatility products.

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,790
And so if we can find cheap volatility and buy that and sell a volatility that we

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,380
think is expensive, we can make money. But here is the important but.

21
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,050
How do we know what is cheap and what is expensive?

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,300
And how can we put a price target on that, right? Let's say, for example,

23
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:45,100
we are looking at Coca-Cola, okay? And we say, well, given, you know,

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,800
price to earnings of Coca-Cola or price to earnings of Pepsi or price to book value

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,520
or however many assets it has divided by liabilities,

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,220
whatever technique we're using, we can actually come up with a fair value,

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,420
right? We see like, let's say, Goldman Sachs comes out and says,

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,030
price target of Tesla, 15,000. Or what's that guy's name on Twitter, Sean?

29
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,510
Pateek. Pateek, right? Partel. Yeah, yeah. Actually,

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,270
I got a call yesterday from Kelly Patel. Interesting. Interesting.

31
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,470
I didn't answer that one. But so we actually see this in equity space, right?

32
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,490
Price target of this. But in the vol space, we don't usually hear people say,

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,280
I think implied volatility should be worth 40%.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,740
Or I think it should be worth 70%. And so in this lab,

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,680
we're going to be talking about that valuation.

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,060
I wish Margin was on here. He did a very in-depth breakdown the other day.

37
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,590
Okay.

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:04,630
So I'm going to share my screen and we're actually going to use Diska as our stock

39
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,930
of choice. But does anyone have any questions about that so far?

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,680
Is anyone confused about what we're trying to do here before we jump into it?

41
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,140
A couple from some of the new members. What are you guys thinking?

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,220
What's going through your heads? Yeah. Let's hear some questions.

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,620
Okay. I guess no questions. All the new members are top-notch.

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,740
They're already pro vol traders. All right. Rachel's just commenting.

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:49,190
We want to find out the value and base volatility based on that. Yes.

46
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,830
We want to find the fair value of volatility, right? Let's say for example,

47
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,310
Rachel, you're looking at a stock. You might say, Hey, fair value is $50,

48
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,450
but it's trading at $30 today. So I'm going to buy it. Right.

49
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,730
And on the flip side, a short seller might say, Hey, I think this is worth $20.

50
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,510
It's trading at 50. So I'm going to sell it. But in the option space,

51
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,110
because the volatility concept is so hidden,

52
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,390
it's so far far off the beaten path, really,

53
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,830
especially in the retail community. You don't hear people say, Hey,

54
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,510
implied volatility is at 90. It should be worth 50.

55
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,240
What we hear in let's say like tasty trade is, Oh, there's high IV rank.

56
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,750
Let's sell it. But we didn't really come up with a value.

57
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,780
What should this volatility be trading at? And if we can,

58
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:45,170
if we can get better at pricing volatility, we can make money. And that's,

59
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,010
that's the important part.

60
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,800
All right, let's do it. Okay. Cool. Cool.

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,300
By the way, guys,

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:08,070
I just found the Avicii album 10 and it's just been on replay. Love it. Okay.

63
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,030
Let's see here.

64
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,090
Okay, cool. So everyone can see my screen.

65
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,810
We are going to do a valuation for Disco.

66
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,970
Now, if you guys want to see a really in-depth valuation, I did one on Tesla.

67
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,570
Sean, we have that in the recordings, right? Yes.

68
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,140
So I did a really in-depth valuation on Tesla.

69
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,400
If you guys want to go check that out. And finally, it's starting to come down.

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,180
So we saw Tesla going below 67 ball today.

71
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,580
And we're actually going to touch on that towards the end and same with Disco actually,

72
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,640
I think it's going to be good if we touch on this. All right. So let's go,

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,580
let's head over to Disco. So first thing is first, how did we find Disco?

74
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,780
Right? Well, we found it by searching for high implied volatility.

75
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,850
That means implied volatility rank, implied volatility versus our forecast.

76
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,420
Okay. That is what we searched for. And we found Disco here.

77
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:23,780
And some of the guys got in on March 19, March 17. Funny enough, Margin Kyle.

78
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,920
So you guys might know him in the group as Margin.

79
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,750
He actually sent me a message on March 16 saying, Jordan,

80
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,400
you got to sell the shit out of Disco ball. And actually, one second, guys,

81
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,620
I'm going to stop sharing my screen.

82
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,390
So I'm going to share Margin's work without his permission.

83
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,970
Don't tell him he's on the call.

84
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,510
Just give me one quick second here, guys.

85
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,310
This is what happens when you share good work. Gets leaked to the whole group.

86
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,350
Exactly.

87
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,080
But it's after the trade, so. Yes.

88
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,190
Okay. Here we go.

89
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,620
Okay. So I get a message from Kyle, March 16. Okay. The peak of Disco.

90
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,430
I don't know how sometimes our group members call these trades,

91
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,140
but I honestly think they just get lucky sometimes. So he says to me, hey,

92
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,580
Jordan, I think you're missing a big banger. The trade is Disco.

93
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,040
And what Margin did was, so he searched,

94
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,280
Margin is searching for high implied volatility stocks.

95
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:08,920
We're trying to find stocks that are in price to earnings terms are expensive or

96
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,860
cheap. We are basically saying, let's scan,

97
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,690
let us create a scan to find undervalued stocks. Now we can't buy all of them,

98
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,550
but we're going to create a scan to find undervalued stocks.

99
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:27,410
And that is what we do with IV rank, IV versus forecast, and a few others,

100
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,030
retail sentiment, et cetera.

101
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,990
So we create a basket of stocks that might be expensive.

102
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,050
And there's tons of lives about how we actually scan for that.

103
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,790
And we're actually just going to go into the evaluation of this stuff.

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,840
So he says, hey, you might be missing out on a banger here.

105
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,080
And the way that Margin prices, he did two ways.

106
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,840
The first way is in absolute terms.

107
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:08,650
So we will come back to Margin in a second.

108
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,790
So there's two ways we want to try to value something.

109
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,210
One is in absolute terms, and the other is in relative terms.

110
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,110
And this is going to be universal. This is not just for volatility.

111
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,590
This is for real estate. This is for equities, for valuations in general.

112
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,150
There are two key ways, in absolute terms and in relative terms.

113
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,050
So does anyone want to give me a quick example of what you think it means by absolute

114
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,850
terms and in relative terms? What do you guys think?

115
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,610
What's going through your heads?

116
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,010
And maybe actually,

117
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,240
if you could give a real life example outside of volatility trading,

118
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,010
absolute terms and in relative value terms. An example outside of trading,

119
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,580
it could be anything. What do you guys think?

120
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,530
Where's Steve? Is Steve on this chat, Sean? Yeah, he's in here.

121
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,410
He's sleeping though, isn't he?

122
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,240
Chris is trying to buy a house in the San Francisco Bay Area. Yeah.

123
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,340
Tell me more, Chris. What do you mean by that?

124
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,480
If we want to price it in absolute terms and in relative terms?

125
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,060
Koaw is like real estate in Montreal is expensive in absolute terms.

126
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,360
Eric's saying price per square foot comparison is relative.

127
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,160
Everyone's giving a real estate example. That's funny.

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,530
So Koaw is like real estate in Montreal is expensive in absolute terms,

129
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,750
but cheap relative to Toronto. Okay.

130
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,230
So let's actually go a little bit more with that, Koaw.

131
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,790
So when you say it's expensive in absolute terms,

132
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,910
why is it expensive in absolute terms? Actually,

133
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,510
Trent had a kind of cool one here. He said,

134
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,970
absolute could be saying that Jamal Murray is good at basketball,

135
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,300
relative is saying that he's bad compared to Steph Curry. Okay. I like that.

136
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,130
So usually when we're looking in absolute terms,

137
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:28,600
we're seeing how this asset relates to itself. Okay. So if we're looking at,

138
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,540
let's say at a certain house in Montreal,

139
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,200
we're looking at this house in Montreal and we graph the price of it over the last,

140
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,740
let's say the last five years.

141
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,960
And we see that it goes up and it goes down and it goes up and it goes down.

142
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,140
And right now it's up here. Well, in absolute terms,

143
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,600
if we're looking at it in a vacuum,

144
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,380
we are saying that this is pretty expensive right now, right?

145
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,920
Maybe we've also compared it to,

146
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,450
we take the price of the house and we divide it by,

147
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,670
let's say the rent of that same house. And we graph it over time, right?

148
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,790
We're looking at it in absolute terms. So for example, price to earnings,

149
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:15,810
right?

150
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,370
We're taking the earnings and the price of the same asset and looking at it through

151
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,890
time. Okay. And we could do price to book. We could do the price itself.

152
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,760
We could do all these different metrics within the same asset. Okay.

153
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,240
And that's going to be an absolute terms in the vacuum.

154
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,780
And we're just looking at the single asset.

155
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,350
Okay. So for example, if we come into relative value here,

156
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,190
am I still sharing my screen, Sean? Yes.

157
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,250
And let's say we're looking at,

158
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,000
you're kidding. Jordan was sober last night,

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,940
but relatively sober compared to Sean.

160
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,720
Perfect. That's actually a perfect way to say it, right?

161
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,900
I was at all times whiskey intake last night, personally, but relative to Sean,

162
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,760
my whiskey intake is very low. You can say something like that. Okay.

163
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,620
So let's take a look here.

164
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,770
Let's take a look at the implied volatility 90 of Tesla versus so actually,

165
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,670
you know, let's, let's just plot the implied volatility by itself.

166
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,700
So we can see like, for example, up here,

167
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,200
Tesla implied volatility is expensive, right? It's pretty expensive.

168
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,290
But one thing about this is like,

169
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,950
this is a kind of like looking at the price chart, you know,

170
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,270
it's not too exciting. So we could do is like, let's say,

171
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,210
create something like price to earnings,

172
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,090
but instead we are going to do IV 90 divided by RV 20,

173
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,850
similar to price to earnings. Okay. We're going to run the ratio.

174
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,330
And now we create another graph, all in absolute terms. And we could say, okay,

175
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,910
well, this implied volatility is expensive right now,

176
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:17,090
relative to it's realized volatility in absolute terms. Okay.

177
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,790
So that is the first way to do it. And, you know, that's how, you know,

178
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,630
you could take this anywhere. Is this expensive in absolute terms?

179
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:28,360
Now that's only one piece of the puzzle. Okay. We can't just say,

180
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,180
we can't just look in absolute terms, right? Things change,

181
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
things outside are changing and we need to, you know,

182
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,300
we need to be aware of that.

183
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,490
So let's say, for example,

184
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,810
we'll be good. So I don't do any real estate,

185
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,790
but I'm trying to just like make an example here.

186
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,850
You go and look at a real estate,

187
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:58,150
you go and look at real estate and there's this house that is looking pretty expensive

188
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,910
in absolute terms. Okay. In terms of the rent that you're,

189
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,710
let's say we create some time series. Yeah. You got it. Let's do it.

190
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,490
Let's talk about real estate, right? Imagine you're looking at a neighborhood,

191
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,890
right? And you notice that the average house there is priced at $300,000,

192
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,660
but there's one house that's priced at $350,000, you know,

193
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,760
that house looks expensive, right? It's like, wow,

194
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,460
around all these other houses, you know, it's you know, looks expensive, right?

195
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,020
But then you notice that that one house,

196
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,010
that house is maybe walking distance from a school,

197
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,710
walking distance from the subway.

198
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,290
There's a grocery store around the corner and a park across the road.

199
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,510
And then you look at other houses in the area that have those same characteristics

200
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,450
and they're all priced at 400,000. Now,

201
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,500
all of a sudden that house is looking cheap, right?

202
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,700
Relative to assets with similar characteristics to it.

203
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Or you notice that that house went up through 50 grand. You're like, wow,

204
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,180
it's gone up a lot,

205
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,040
but you see it's actually still cheap relative to similar ones.

206
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,250
I like that one.

207
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,440
So that's, that's, you know,

208
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:25,870
it's a way to think about in terms of relative or it's looking expensive,

209
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,400
but a Walmart just got built or a school just got built.

210
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,480
And so now it's totally different. Things have changed.

211
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,810
So that's what we need to do. We need to price it relatively as well. Okay.

212
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,410
We don't want to just look at Coca-Cola by itself.

213
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,070
We want to look at Coca-Cola relative to Pepsi.

214
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:51,290
So that's what we're going to do here. We'll do Coke and Pepsi.

215
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,160
And what we'll do is we'll take the price of Coke and the price of Pepsi.

216
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,960
I will say, well, we will look at the IV 90s and we'll run the ratio, right?

217
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,360
We'll see what's going on here. And you can see basically like up here,

218
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,020
if we take, you know, Coca-Cola volatility and divide it by Pepsi ball,

219
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,240
this is when it got pretty expensive, right?

220
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,580
And you can see it stays within this range. It's pretty, you know,

221
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,890
it's pretty stationary. It's staying within this range. And this can, you know,

222
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,670
if we saw, let's say Coke all the way up here,

223
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,330
you know, this was going to be extremely expensive.

224
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,720
So this is what happened with Diska. Okay. So this is what Margin sent me.

225
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:47,210
So he did Fox A and Diska and he graphed these out and look what he noticed.

226
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,030
He said, okay, you know, these are, you know, pretty much in line,

227
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,160
but all of a sudden we're out to lunch. All right.

228
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,240
This thing is getting priced extremely high. I said, okay, well,

229
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,720
let's take a look here. If Fox A, what's that?

230
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah. Foxa was a, um, oh, so, okay. We're going to get to that in a second,

231
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,200
but basically it was a correlated stock. And I'll show you how we found that,

232
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,580
but there's a correlated stock, similar characteristics also in, uh,

233
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,580
in the same space as Disney discovery, whatever it is.

234
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,680
And you can also do Netflix, I guess, Disney, all those,

235
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,360
all those names to see what's going on there.

236
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,220
Um, so he says, it's pretty expensive. And basically you can see from this,

237
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,640
right? You could say, well, okay, on the high end,

238
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:50,770
Diska is usually 1.2 times the IV of Fox A. Okay. You can see that right here.

239
00:18:50,950 --> 00:19:00,010
1.2 times is on the high end. So if we know that Fox A is trading at 48 vol,

240
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:09,350
then Disney or discovery should be trading at 48 times 1.2. Uh,

241
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,580
who's got the quick maths that's 60 vol 58 vol. Okay.

242
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:24,100
But instead it's trading at 83. Now, you know, this is sometimes, uh,

243
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,780
we can be on the wrong side of these, right? So we need to dig deep.

244
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,230
We need to really understand what's going on here. So what else does he do?

245
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,200
Well, you know, from our chat here, right? So here it is, guys,

246
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,680
here's Fox A and discovery. He does the ratio IV nineties.

247
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,980
That's what he's looking at. Okay. That's one way to look at it.

248
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,890
But here's what he also does.

249
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,460
He sends me this graph and this is in the terminal.

250
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,630
And what this graph is telling us is, are these two assets actually correlated?

251
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,720
Okay. He's trying to like,

252
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
you have to make sure that these two assets are correlated.

253
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,680
Otherwise you can't really compare, right?

254
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,070
You can't compare Shopify and Coca-Cola. So let's head back to the terminal.

255
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:18,000
So we're gonna come to correlation and do Disco and Fox A and here,

256
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,880
we're going to remove the outliers. So let's hit this.

257
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,560
So here are the price graphs. Look at that. Look at them.

258
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,820
Almost the same thing. Okay. Here's the rolling correlation.

259
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,120
So if we take 60 day samples, cut them up and we take that correlation. Well,

260
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,380
we're going to see that most of the time,

261
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,950
these assets are between 70 and 80% correlated.

262
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,820
70 to 80% of these assets are correlated over the last year.

263
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:59,810
And you can also see this, okay? That, you know, these are the returns.

264
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:12,280
So when Fox A is up 6%, you can see that Disco is up 1.1 times 6%. Okay.

265
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,260
1.1 times 6%. So it'll be up about 6.7%.

266
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,600
And this is what, this is how we're trying to value the volatility, right?

267
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:33,210
This beta is basically telling us that the volatility of Fox A times 1.14 is going

268
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,840
to equal Disco volatility.

269
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,530
Okay. So that's what Margin is doing.

270
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,390
He's making sure these assets are the same and he's trying to value it.

271
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,040
So now let's head back over to a relative value. He also did XLC,

272
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,380
which is an ETF that holds these, these like subscription companies,

273
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,260
like Discovery, Netflix, Disney, et cetera.

274
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,080
And you can see it was just like through the roof. Okay.

275
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,620
Implied volatility was just through the roof.

276
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,360
And there's so many more ways we can value this, guys. We can do more assets,

277
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,440
right? We can even do IV divided by RV. So check this one out, guys.

278
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,190
I really like this one. This is one of my little secrets.

279
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,890
I wouldn't say it's a secret, but I really like this one. So you take,

280
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:41,590
you take the implied volatility 90 divided by the realized volatility 20. Okay.

281
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,990
And that's going to give you a spread.

282
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,590
And then you do it for a similar company. This is,

283
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,610
this is in William Sinclair's book, by the way, guys.

284
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,650
So I guess it's not really one of my secrets.

285
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,190
Okay. And oh,

286
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,160
wow. Oh, guys, I have this one messed up.

287
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh, shoot. Let's see if this works.

288
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,530
Sorry, guys. I got to change. I got to fix this. But anyways,

289
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,310
you take the ratio of these and the ratio of these,

290
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:29,240
and you'll be able to graph it, right? So if we did this, we ratioed, and guys,

291
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,040
stop me along the way. If we're confused, right? This is important stuff,

292
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,270
right? This is important stuff. We're trying to, we're trying to,

293
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,070
we're trying to make some money here. So this is important that we can,

294
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,430
we're trading volatility, right? We need to be able to value it.

295
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,330
Okay. So you can see here, Fox A was only 0.93,

296
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,320
was the ratio when Disco was 1.3.

297
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,260
We've got some questions coming in. Let's just take a look.

298
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,250
Why 90 days compared to RV20? First off, Rachel, thanks for asking questions.

299
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,870
You know, it's super important. It's super important.

300
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,640
So thanks for jumping in here. We're,

301
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,600
we're looking at the IV90 because that's what we wanted to trade.

302
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,720
We wanted a little bit more exposure to Vega,

303
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,860
meaning the implied volatility than we did to Theta.

304
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,730
So we went out a little bit more in time, let's say 90 days, 100 days.

305
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,110
And so that's why we're comparing the IV90 to the RV20.

306
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,250
Also implied volatility, it cares about what's happening now, right?

307
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,830
And the reason it's caring about what's happening now is because volatility clusters.

308
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,990
So we're not going to look at, let's say the RV60 or the RV90,

309
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,460
because that's going to have, you know,

310
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,820
what happened 90 days ago doesn't really care.

311
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,480
We don't really care about it today.

312
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,960
And so that's why we're looking at a shorter realized vol time period.

313
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,720
But we're looking at a longer IV period.

314
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,940
Chris is saying, how did you find Fox A?

315
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,380
I think Margin, so I didn't find Fox A, Margin did.

316
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,200
And I think he just went and did a Google search on what are similar assets,

317
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,480
what are similar companies. Reach out to Margin,

318
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,660
ask him what secrets he's got up his sleeve there.

319
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,850
Okay, so now we can actually price this implied volatility, right? We can say,

320
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:45,530
okay, well, it should be about 1.2 times Fox A and about 1.3 times XLC.

321
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,300
And we obviously, you know, value it in absolute terms as well. And we say,

322
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,930
okay, well, if things were to quiet down a bit, where are we going to go to?

323
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:04,280
Right? And we know volatilities mean reverting. So we plot the IV90 and we say,

324
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,000
okay, well, recently before this big spike, it was trading at around 56, 57.

325
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,690
So once this vol is, let's say, gone, this news is gone,

326
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,610
we should see this come back down to 57.

327
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,320
So now we're getting a sense of, okay, if we're right,

328
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,210
where are we going to be able to,

329
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,170
where are we going to get out of our position? And you can see here.

330
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:41,000
So even though the guys got out at 66, right, 66 vol or 65 vol,

331
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,740
it's continuing to melt off another two points today. And if our, let's say,

332
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:53,540
fair value was 55 or 57, well, we might want to keep holding this until we get,

333
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,710
you know, to the level we're looking for. One thing to keep in mind though,

334
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,270
is that there is an earnings event coming up in this cycle.

335
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,270
So we're probably not going to get that 57 mark,

336
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,510
which is why I think the guys cashed out yesterday.

337
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,920
Now, obviously there's more advanced techniques we can use to value volatility,

338
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,660
but I think this is a great start.

339
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,320
If you want to see a little more advanced tutorial, I did one on Tesla.

340
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,590
And that is finally starting to come down. I can't believe it.

341
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,140
Can't believe it. Right.

342
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,720
We saw implied volatility get all the way up to the high numbers here.

343
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,300
And it's finally, look at that guys. Just finally, absolutely melting off.

344
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,480
And, you know,

345
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,630
I'm still holding the position simply because I have it valued at 58 vol.

346
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,830
I have the two-year value at 58 vol. So I'm holding for another 10 vegas.

347
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,340
Right. It took so close saying it took a month, but the P&L is coming in huge.

348
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:15,410
Right. We're talking about an option that went from 850, $850, sorry, $85,000.

349
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:23,340
$850 is the contract, is the contract spec, but $85,000 for one lot. Right.

350
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,600
Coming down to $800.

351
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,320
So, you know, it might take a month,

352
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:38,490
but now we're making 10% P&L on our straddle. Right. And, you know,

353
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,810
sometimes you got to wait. Right.

354
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,730
Sometimes you got to be all good things come to people who are patient.

355
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,030
By the way, Sean. Oh, Sean, we haven't finished Ronan yet.

356
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,220
After this. Yeah.

357
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:07,550
So that is basically valuing volatility in a nutshell,

358
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,470
in a super high-level overview.

359
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,710
Questions, comments, concerns. What's going on? So, Jordan, you know,

360
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,860
should you, should someone be doing this for every trade they take?

361
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:35,600
100%. 100%. The last thing I'm going to say about this is,

362
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,660
the last thing I'm going to say about this is the spot IVOL correlation.

363
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:52,230
So check this out guys. Okay. Here is DISCA. Okay. What do we notice here?

364
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,940
Okay. What do we notice here?

365
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,530
What are you guys seeing?

366
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,110
Implied volatility, 90 and the spot price.

367
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,930
Rachel's saying they look correlated. Perfect, Rachel. Wow. Blessing.

368
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,110
Rachel's following it, following in your footsteps here.

369
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,650
She's, she's going to be a rockstar very soon.

370
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,830
So what do we see here? Well,

371
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,760
the implied volatility and the stock price are correlated. Okay.

372
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,080
So we might also have a directional view here and say, okay, well,

373
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,900
if I honestly think DISCA is overpriced, let's say that's what I'm thinking.

374
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,780
And if DISCA were to trade down to $60 a share,

375
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:48,330
what would implied volatility be at? Right. If it were to trade down to 60,

376
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,370
what would implied volatility be at? And if let's say we're to go to a hundred,

377
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,680
what would implied volatility be at? And that's, you know,

378
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,240
that's going to be for a more advanced topic,

379
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,060
but that's another way that we can value this volatility. Okay.

380
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,380
We're trying our very best.

381
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,120
The person that can value the volatility the best is going to make a ton of money.

382
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,010
So the more things we can do to try to get a sense of what fair value is for this,

383
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,610
then we're going to make some money. It's honestly like real estate.

384
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:22,360
It's kind of funny. Like people, a lot of people spend so much time, you know,

385
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,340
trying to price a house. Is this thing fair value? Is it not fair value?

386
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,580
But when it comes to trading, we don't really want to put any numbers to it.

387
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,880
We don't want to really value this thing. And I think it's so important that,

388
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,900
you know, that we do.

389
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,540
So, you know, it's, it seems like it's pretty clear that it's important to,

390
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,420
to value it.

391
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:53,950
Do you want to maybe show let's draw a conclusion here on DISCA for example,

392
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,570
right? And obviously we're looking at today's data,

393
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,490
so it's not going to be as pricey as it was when we originally took the trade,

394
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:06,250
but maybe let's draw our conclusion here on DISCA and then use the option calculator

395
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,130
to,

396
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,010
or the vol calculator to price out what the options should be worth and what our

397
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,090
expected value is. And, you know,

398
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,230
like how we can turn this into what we expect to happen for the trade.

399
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,380
Okay. So Jared, really good point.

400
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:27,760
Jared saying the catalyst for that repricing was the stock coming down, right?

401
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,870
Check this out. This goes down 10 and a half percent.

402
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,290
That's a crazy amount of vol,

403
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,820
but that catalyst to reprice the vol to what we think might be fair value or should

404
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,220
be fair value was the stock dropping, right?

405
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,320
Or was some news coming out saying, whatever it is. And that, that,

406
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,080
and that gave the reprice, but it's just like when we're buying an equity,

407
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,780
right? Let's say we're buying an equity and, you know, we think it's worth $80.

408
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,000
It's trading for 20. Well, what's that catalyst going to be?

409
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,060
That's going to shoot it up. Maybe the catalyst is the company says,

410
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:08,840
we are actually going to be paying all our debt or we just got a huge line of credit

411
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,420
or whatever it is, or sometimes it's even a company coming in and saying,

412
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,360
I'm going to buy this company for fair value,

413
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,600
but we usually need some type of catalyst, some spark.

414
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:28,840
That's going to bring this thing back down to our fair value price calculator.

415
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,020
So here we go. Let's say we're looking at this guy.

416
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:37,610
This guy was trading at 80 bucks and Sean,

417
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:51,830
let's say did the 90 combo. And it was for July. You're on June there.

418
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,180
Okay. And volatility was, what was it Sean? 85.

419
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:13,280
So here is what that combo was trading at $32.

420
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,480
So if you're going to sell the 90 straddle for, uh,

421
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,680
on Disco for the July contracts, now Sean did a strangle, but in this example,

422
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:28,660
we're going to do a, uh, a straddle. Okay. You can see our Delta is 50. Okay.

423
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,420
So we're selling the Delta 50 straddle on Disco.

424
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,900
Now let's say we think that fair value of this option is 65 vol.

425
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,780
That's how much, you know,

426
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,700
hopefully the market is going to realize that now the beauty of the,

427
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,120
of an option of the option market is fair value has to be recognized. Why,

428
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,440
why does fair value have to be recognized as an option market,

429
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,020
but it doesn't have to be realized in a stock.

430
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,180
Why is that?

431
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,830
Justin saying vol mean reverts. What do you guys think?

432
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,740
Because of realized vols time components. Thank you, Eric. Thank you.

433
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,660
And Steven, thank you. An option expires. So if, you know,

434
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,950
let's say we think fair value is 65. If it realizes 65,

435
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,390
we're going to get paid out with a stock.

436
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,400
It could stay under fair value forever. So that's,

437
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,290
that's the most beautiful thing of the options market that I love is that if there

438
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,690
is a fair value, the options will realize it.

439
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,260
The downside to that is sometimes you end up carrying this option for three months.

440
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,180
Sure. You're going to make money, but it took a long time to pay out.

441
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,530
Okay. And all you're going to be doing if it's,

442
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,170
if it's not paying out is every single day,

443
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,530
you're going to be making that data that carry,

444
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,510
it's going to be carrying very well.

445
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,620
Yeah.

446
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,300
Yeah. Jerry, we, we've definitely bagged held a few times here. No doubt.

447
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:14,860
No doubt.

448
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,940
If you have these ones, you're not a real trader. Exactly. Yeah, no doubt.

449
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,860
But the thing like, you know,

450
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,120
at least if you bag hold an option that's under fair value or, you know,

451
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,100
below fair value, that's right.

452
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,040
It's above fair value and you're realizing under it that you're going to make,

453
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,240
you're going to make good return.

454
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,960
And here is exactly how much you're going to make actually.

455
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,960
So let's go back to the example, implied volatility, 85%.

456
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,680
Option should be trading at $34. We think it's worth 65,

457
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,380
which means we think the option is worth $26.

458
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,640
Can someone break this down for me? Can someone break this down for me?

459
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,220
I'll show you one more time. It's currently trading at $33, $34 trading at 34,

460
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,150
the option. And we think it should be worth 26.

461
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,220
Can someone break down for me? What is going on here?

462
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,230
Eight chicken strips. Tell me more, Steve.

463
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,480
What's going to happen here?

464
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,340
Let's say we're right.

465
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,080
Stevie.

466
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,820
Lauren's saying predicting a different vol. Yes.

467
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,330
So what's basically going to happen is two things could happen here.

468
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,570
Imagine we're right. And this thing is actually worth 65 vol.

469
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,580
Well, we're going to end up, two things are going to happen.

470
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,080
The first thing and the thing that we don't want to really happen is we're going

471
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:22,180
to hold this option for three months and we are going to realize $8.

472
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,940
We are going to make $800 per contract.

473
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:33,880
The thing is, we don't really want to wait three months. But you know what?

474
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,480
800 bucks is $800.

475
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:43,780
The second thing that could happen that we want to happen is the market is going

476
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,760
to realize that we're right. Some catalyst comes out,

477
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,570
some type of repricing happens. And the market says, this is the fair value.

478
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,160
And the options will drop from $34 to $26.

479
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,130
In which case we would have earned $8.

480
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,190
And let's say a week or two weeks or three weeks. And that is what our goal is.

481
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,080
Our goal is for the market to eventually say, you know,

482
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,400
the guys are predicting alpha are right.

483
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,380
The guys and girls are predicting alpha are right.

484
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,500
And that this thing should be trading at 26 or 65 vol.

485
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,510
Okay. That's the best case scenario. Obviously,

486
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,410
the worst case scenario is we're wrong.

487
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,390
This thing's worth 110 vol and it blows through the roof.

488
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,550
But our expected value on this trade is $8.

489
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,970
Our expected value is $8. If we realize that $8 quicker,

490
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,180
higher return on capital. Better for us.

491
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,370
But the beauty is we will eventually realize that $8.

492
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,400
So, Cole, he doesn't have a view on Delta. Correct.

493
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,930
Sean, you want to add anything there?

494
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,120
So Ram's asking, how do we come to the assumption that it's 65 vol?

495
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:23,800
So Ram, it was all the valuation we did earlier. So in this case, right,

496
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:29,380
we were looking at, we saw here. Okay. Well, look, before this big expansion,

497
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,220
right? Vol was trading at around 56, right? We have an earnings event now.

498
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,980
So it's probably going to be a little bit higher, right? Maybe 60.

499
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,970
So that's one way, right? We're taking a look at the vol cone. Okay. Well,

500
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:48,650
third quantile is 53. That's pretty pricey, right? So right off the bat,

501
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,610
we're thinking it could definitely pop in around this area, right?

502
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,840
Between the mean and the third quantile. Because vol is mean reverting.

503
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,940
The second thing is in relative terms, right? When we priced it against box A,

504
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,890
we priced it against XLC. Okay.

505
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,580
And like I was saying, there's more sophisticated techniques. We can say, okay,

506
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,420
well, you know, we can do some quick modeling to say,

507
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,080
maybe we'll do a whole live on this on spot versus eyeball.

508
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,340
But basically if spot were to drop to a certain price,

509
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,120
what would implied volatility be? Okay.

510
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,440
So that's how we're coming to the conclusion.

511
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:33,540
We're trying to price this volatility, right? Like an actual hard number.

512
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,350
You guys have seen me in the group multiple times say, you know,

513
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,600
especially when we were doing the lit, the arc, the Tesla, you know,

514
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,770
almost never do we say volatility is high in this story, right?

515
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,350
That's usually a tip of the tasty trader way. Hey, vol is high,

516
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:58,740
right? That's not what we do here. Volatility is high. If we are right,

517
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,970
volatility is going to go to 50. If we are wrong,

518
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,790
we're going to stress the position to vol moving up 10 points and we're out of the

519
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,590
position. Okay. That's the big difference.

520
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,590
We're actually trying to value something. What is this thing worth, right?

521
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:20,890
Imagine Warren Buffett just said, Hey, the stock is cheap. And that's it. Well,

522
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,190
when would he get out? You know,

523
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,250
maybe he's cutting his losers too quick because his fair value is still a lot higher.

524
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,610
So what Warren Buffett does is he looks at the balance sheet and says, Hey,

525
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:38,700
this company is worth $80. It's trading at 40. Well, I can get 40 bucks here.

526
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,690
I think that's a big,

527
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,950
actually mistake that a lot of technicians do is they say, Hey, this is,

528
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:54,710
this is breaking out, right? It's like saying, Hey, this is a Lamborghini. Hey,

529
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,190
this is a, you know, this is this, but instead we want to say, Hey,

530
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,970
this is a Lamborghini. It's worth a hundred. It's worth, you know,

531
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,540
200,000 and someone's willing to give it to me for 50,000. Well,

532
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,820
now there's a trade to be made here.

533
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:22,000
Any more questions about that? You know, if not, just to wrap it up,

534
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,060
we're always playing a game of buy cheap things, sell expensive things,

535
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,580
and we can't forget that. Right. Um,

536
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,360
and just because something is high doesn't mean it's expensive.

537
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,300
Just because something's low doesn't mean it's cheap.

538
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,680
So these are the methods we use to try and find what we think it should be worth.

539
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,480
You can only say something's cheap or expensive when you can price what you think

540
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,390
it's really worth, right?

541
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:56,100
So these are just a couple of techniques you can use to do it. And, uh,

542
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,450
you know, we put ourselves in a better spot to win.

543
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:05,450
If we can take advantage of them, right? Like in the, in the retail space,

544
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,270
especially nobody has tools like this. And, uh, you know, by,

545
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:14,710
by learning to use them, we're setting ourselves up pretty nice to,

546
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,050
to make better decisions and keep practicing guys,

547
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,270
keep practicing pricing stuff, right?

548
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:25,790
I don't expect any of you to be born volatility traders, born option traders,

549
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,510
uh, keep pricing, keep practicing,

550
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,090
keep getting feedback and do it over and over and over again until you actually

551
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,950
get good. Right. And for example, uh,

552
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,950
someone was asking how margin found this ticker, uh, without asking,

553
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,030
I can probably safely assume by just doing a whole bunch of searching,

554
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,140
trying different, you know, looking, using different filters in the,

555
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,720
on the scanner, building out different lists, looking at it saying, oh,

556
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,590
this looks kind of funny. And then doing some more research, you know, and, uh,

557
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,430
it probably wasn't the first ticker he looked at.

558
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,150
It probably wasn't the last ticker he looked at. Right.

559
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:03,260
There's probably a lot of them in between. Well, a funny story though, Sean,

560
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,680
is that Disco and block were the top two on our, on our scan, right?

561
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,680
You just the top two on Ivy rank. Yeah.

562
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,780
Top two on Ivy rank and Ivy over forecast. Um,

563
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,180
those were the top two on our list. So, you know, that's,

564
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,260
that's probably obviously how margin found it, but just because it's up there,

565
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,760
it doesn't mean it's a good sell or a goodbye, right?

566
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,220
You got to actually try to price this thing.

567
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,380
So let's, uh, I think this is one that's worth like assigning some homework.

568
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,480
You know, like we should, we should set a little challenge here.

569
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,700
Let's think of something, Jordan.

570
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,290
I want to, I want to see some people's analysis. Yeah.

571
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:53,850
Maybe we can do a valuation and then best valuation gets, uh, so we'll,

572
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,900
we'll give out a company. Best valuation gets something. Yeah.

573
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,950
Or maybe we could do like a, like a pitch night, a pitch night. Yeah. Oh,

574
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,690
that's, that's so much fun. Oh, that's a great. Oh, that's a great idea.

575
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,990
What do you guys think about that? Chris,

576
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,850
you guys like that for the pitch night? Oh, thanks, man. Is Chris going first?

577
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:18,140
What? Chris wants to go first. He's saying, I think Chris wants to go first.

578
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,140
Um, yeah. Like where, you know, go out, you try and value a company and, uh,

579
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,420
you know, we could do a zoom, have like zoom for sure. Pitch their stock. Yeah.

580
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:30,950
Yeah. I like it.

581
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,790
I was going to come on and pitch why everyone should buy Tesla. No, nothing.

582
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,850
Just spitting straight fat.

583
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,220
You'll just show his PNL. Exactly.

584
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,620
Yeah. Let me know that idea. We'll, uh, we can, we can do something like that.

585
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,410
I think it could be fun. Game night tomorrow guys.

586
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,740
And then tomorrow game night. Yeah. Don't miss that. It'll be a,

587
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:02,440
it'll be a good, good time. Um, so actually one quick one before you guys run,

588
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:08,560
because it was a big PNL, a GME. So, uh, super quickly, uh,

589
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,740
GME came up on the scanner is extremely expensive. And then we valued the ball.

590
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,340
We said, okay, tomorrow, what is ball going to look like?

591
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:20,570
And then is that cheaper expensive relative to, you know, past moves,

592
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,330
historical moves, given what we know about the stock, given, you know,

593
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:28,890
did some ball rate analysis. Um, it looked extremely, extremely expensive. And,

594
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,730
you know, we basically said tomorrow it's going to be worth 300 ball, which,

595
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:37,530
which, which, uh, you know, fortunately it happened and a huge PNL day. Right.

596
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,370
So that's just another example of,

597
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:44,240
I was trying to value the volatility and not just saying it's high, it's high.

598
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:44,960
We have to stop.

599
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,290
Okay. Everyone, I guess that will be it for tonight's live.

600
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,070
Thanks for coming out.
