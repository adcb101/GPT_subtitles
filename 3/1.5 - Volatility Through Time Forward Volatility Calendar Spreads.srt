1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,650
Hey, guys. So in this live,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,360
we're going to be chatting about how volatility moves through time,

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,630
how to calculate forward volatility,

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,580
and how to actually trade these calendar spreads. Now,

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,900
we're not gonna go in detail on this one on how to trade the calendar spreads because

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,960
it is going to be, you know, quite a dense live.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,780
And we're going to start from the basics, right?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,380
We can't start all the way up here until we really set a good foundation here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,580
Okay. So let us jump right into it. Oh, Dylan,

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,120
nice to see you out here as well. Which Dylan is it? Robinson. Oh, Dylan,

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,570
what's up, man? Okay. So let me share my screen.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,580
So as you guys are in, you know, bronze, silver,

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
you guys are really not focused on volatility through time. Okay.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,520
So when I say volatility through time,

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,510
I mean volatility at different expirations, right? Guys, think about it, right?

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,150
There's, you know, most of the time we're looking at, you know,

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,150
we pick like how far out do we want to trade? And then we, we,

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,610
we pick the chain that we want to look at.

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,930
And then we're looking across the strikes within that chain. Well, you know,

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,470
there's gotta be something that can be done with the fact that there's all these

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,150
different expirations, right?

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,250
How can we take advantage of the fact that different chains expire at different

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,990
times? Is there money to be made looking across that?

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,750
And that's what we call looking across time, right?

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,930
Most of the time we're looking across, we're looking across the chain,

26
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,870
but now we're looking across chains. So like we said, advanced topic,

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,810
but nonetheless,

28
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,530
this is stuff that you guys need to know at least at a later stage of your,

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,910
your trading career. So let's hop into it.

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,920
So we're going to start with explaining how volatility actually moves. Okay.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,600
And so how we're going to do that is I'm actually going to, um,

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,100
we're going to price two different options here. Okay.

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,660
We're going to price this straddle. So this is what straddle,

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,760
this is November 20 at the money, at the money. Okay. November 20 at the money.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,590
And we're also going to price a 238 day option.

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:32,460
So in June, 2021 option. Yeah. So we've got two positions here. Okay.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:43,760
We have a November straddle and we have a, um, June straddle. Okay.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Now some of you guys will say like, for example, around an earnings date,

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,120
you guys will say, Oh, you know, why would I,

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,920
why would I sell something that's further back?

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,300
It only has let's say 50% implied volatility when I can sell something that's five

42
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,560
days away with a hundred percent implied volatility. Okay. Well,

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,180
let's see what happens here. Let's see what happens.

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,280
What I'm going to do is we're going to start with this straddle right here.

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,610
Okay. The November and we're going to drop volatility by 10%. Okay.

46
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,970
So volatility is going to come down 10% for the November expiration.

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,600
So remember guys, each expiration has a different volatility level. Okay.

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,160
Why do they have different volatility levels? We're going to get into that.

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,810
Yeah. Because different things might happen during different times. Okay.

50
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,970
And we get into why they're also a little bit different. And yeah,

51
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,150
remember that. So volatility is always quoted annually.

52
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,190
So even though these are two different expirations, one is a, you know,

53
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,190
a 30 day option and the other is a 230 day option.

54
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,110
Both will be quoted in annualized implied volatility terms so that we can sort of

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,650
compare apples to apples in a sense, right?

56
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,690
Because if we just looked at the price of these two,

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,490
the price would be drastically different.

58
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,350
And that would skew our view on what's going on.

59
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,950
We need to think about it about what is this price of this option actually implying

60
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,970
for the stock between now and the expiration.

61
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,110
The way we do that is by looking at it in terms of the implied volatility.

62
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,790
How much is the market implying the stock is going to move in that expiration period

63
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,910
between now and that expiration period. Yeah. So we're going to drop November.

64
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,750
Okay. By 10%. Why are you picking 10% and why are we dropping this? Yep.

65
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,290
Just random number. So we're just gonna say if volatility drops 10%,

66
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,490
what happens? Yeah. So most people will say, well, you know,

67
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,430
if it drops 10% in the front, I'm going to make, you know,

68
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,940
maybe the same amount of money as I am in the back. Okay.

69
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,600
So we dropped this by 10% and you can see, we make $2,500 on this trade. Okay.

70
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,950
Assuming stocks trading here, vol drops by 10%. We make 2,500 bucks.

71
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,420
Let's do the same thing, but in the back month, we're going to drop vol by 10%.

72
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:20,270
What's happened here. We've made $7,300.

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,980
Okay. We've made $7,300. Now we've clearly made a lot more money.

74
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,670
That is because this option has a lot more Vega. Okay. It has a lot more Vega.

75
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,190
So what would be an equivalent implied move change to get an equivalent dollar figure?

76
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,220
So let's see. Maybe if we drop this by, let's say 3%,

77
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,990
we get about the same amount of money.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,060
So the front month needs to drop by 10% in order to be equivalent to the back dropping

79
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,000
only 3%.

80
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,950
Okay. And this is because of the Vega exposure for each of the options.

81
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,910
I think we can explain this really well using the whiteboard draw two timelines.

82
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,730
One that's 230 days, one that's you know,

83
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,070
20 days and show like with the earnings event there and like the whole,

84
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,330
like dividing out like the volatility for each day and getting like how you actually

85
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,210
make up what the volatility is for that option, the daily moves. Did you, Oh,

86
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,330
I see what you're saying. Um,

87
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,940
I think we're gonna do one more thing before we get there,

88
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,220
but we're definitely gonna get there. Okay. Perfect. Okay.

89
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,000
So what's happening here and why is this the case?

90
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,080
Price slices on. Yep. Yep. No problem. Yeah.

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay. So here is, um, option one. Okay. The 20th, the 20th,

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,000
the November 20th Vega is two 58 and here Vega is neck is a 730.

93
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:20,170
So we get three times more Vega. Okay. Now what we notice here though, guys is,

94
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,040
um, so, so why is this happening? Right. What's, what's going on here? Well,

95
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,190
what we find is that volatility doesn't move linearly or linear, right?

96
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,750
And what that means is if the front month volatility goes up 10%,

97
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,950
the back month doesn't go up 10%. Right. So I'm going to draw this out.

98
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,940
You can just switch it up quick whiteboard.

99
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,660
And just keep in mind guys, this is gold level stuff. So, you know, don't be,

100
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,040
uh, don't be, um, uh, discouraged. Everyone's going to get here.

101
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,060
So let's say we have the term structure. Okay. So here is November.

102
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:12,400
Here is December. Here is January and here is may of 2022 21 or June or June.

103
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,790
Let's say there's a big, uh, big bang. Okay. Something, something, uh,

104
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,540
president Trump says I'm dropping out of that election. Okay. Well,

105
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,520
what's going to happen here?

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,360
This term structure is not going to turn into this.

107
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,670
Okay. This is not what's going to happen, right? This, they all don't move up.

108
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,740
Let's say 10 points. Okay. The volatilities don't all move up 10 points. Now,

109
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,360
why is this the case? Does anyone want to tell me why this doesn't happen?

110
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,440
Okay. Just to make sure we're all on the same,

111
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,920
let's make sure we're all on the same page here. Who can, who can tell us why?

112
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,030
Trump says I'm dropping out of the election.

113
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,700
Why doesn't the whole surface move up the same amount? The event is diluted.

114
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,010
Okay. You want to expand on that? Yeah. We need some more.

115
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,920
We need some more guys.

116
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,420
Neil, what's the answer, man?

117
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,620
Okay. No, no. That is true. That is true. But that actually, that is not true.

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,940
That's actually not true.

119
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,530
Dylan.

120
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,900
Okay. Dylan got it. What did Neil say? The news is now not the whole 300 days.

121
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,070
Okay. Guys, volatility is mean reverting, right?

122
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,890
Volatility is mean reverting in the long run. Okay. Volatility looks like this.

123
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,390
So when it's up here, every imagine guys,

124
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,090
when this level right here is up here. Okay.

125
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,190
Everybody knows that in the future, volatility is going to come down.

126
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,670
So what are you going to do as a trader?

127
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,460
Imagine if this went all the way up here as well, the two year options, well,

128
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,620
you would go and sell it knowing with a lot of confidence that you're going to make

129
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,440
money, right? You would go and sell it because volatility is mean reverting.

130
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,220
So what happens is the front month will move up.

131
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,620
So this is what will actually happen. Guys, the front month spikes 30 points.

132
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:51,050
Okay. Then the back month right here, and then right here, and then right here.

133
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,210
And we look something like this.

134
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,410
Okay. Now we need to keep something in mind.

135
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,400
This option is still going to experience the same.

136
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,180
It's still going to experience the event.

137
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,460
This option right here is going to see the exact same event as this. Okay.

138
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,860
And what do we, what do we mean by that? Imagine from Trump's,

139
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,120
the Trump saying I'm out of this, I'm gone guys.

140
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,050
The next week implied move was 20%. Okay.

141
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,290
The next week implied move was a 20% move. So Trump says today,

142
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,290
I'm out market say next week, there's going to be a 20% move up or down.

143
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:48,690
This option right here is still going to see this event, right?

144
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,660
Let's think about it. We have a timeline here, right?

145
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:06,580
Option one expires here. Option two expires here and option three expires here.

146
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,180
All three of them see what's happening today. Right guys.

147
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,220
And then this is where Sean was saying what's happening though,

148
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:29,610
is that this is being diluted. Okay. This option right here is being diluted.

149
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,370
And what do we mean by dilution? Let's do this.

150
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,660
You can drop here. Nice. Imagine we have, okay. Imagine we have,

151
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,440
imagine we're looking at this option right here and it only has three days until

152
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,300
expiration. Actually, let's say five days,

153
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,940
five days to expiration and the market thinks that the moves are going to be 5%.

154
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,160
Okay. On day one, 5% on day two, actually let's go 10% on day one,

155
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:19,440
10% on day two, then 5% and 5% and then it starts trickling down. Okay.

156
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,980
Back to let's see what the average is of 2%. Back to the average. Well,

157
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,100
this member volatility, just the average of the daily moves. Yeah.

158
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,920
Like here's a like a real world example to think about how it is, right?

159
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,300
Coronavirus comes out, everyone panics.

160
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,780
There's no toilet paper in the supermarkets,

161
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,110
but today you can go buy toilet paper. What happened?

162
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,230
Initially there was huge volatility. Nobody knew what was going to happen.

163
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,490
Things got crazy,

164
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,200
but then eventually people went back to a relative normal life, right?

165
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,780
There was a curve of like from normal, normal, normal, extreme panic.

166
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,520
And then it slowly trickles back down to no panic.

167
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,760
Neil, can you get, can you get the calculator up quick?

168
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,750
So I got it. Okay. So, so what is the average of these?

169
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:28,680
How many are there? Five? Yeah. Five 6.4 6.4 6.4 that's the average. Okay.

170
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,500
Now we know the average move and you guys know by now that we multiply it by 16

171
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,170
102.4.

172
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,380
So,

173
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,540
so on the option chain you would see an implied vol for this five day expiry option

174
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,490
of 102.4. Okay. Because that's the average of all the days. Okay.

175
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,090
Now let's look at an option that is 20 days. Okay.

176
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,050
Or imagine we're looking at this one out here, guys, super far out. Okay.

177
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,550
It's called 200 days, 200 days.

178
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,590
Now this option is still going to see this 10% move.

179
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,790
It's still going to see the next day,

180
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,460
10% move and the next 5% and the next 5% and the next 2%.

181
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,110
It's still going to see that, but now it's going to have, so what's that? 1, 2,

182
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,970
3, 4, 5. It's going to have 195 days of 2%. Or 196,

183
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,080
1, 2, 3, 4, right? The fifth. So 196,

184
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:38,870
196 times two plus five plus five plus 10 plus 10 divided by 200. Yep. 2.11,

185
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:48,110
2.11% times 16 times 16 is 33.76 equals 33.76.

186
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,260
So if we looked on the option chains, right. And you know,

187
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,000
we looked at the five day expiry, we would see 102.4%.

188
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,120
And if we went all the way down the chain and looked at the 200 day expiration,

189
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,480
we would see 33.76 even though both see that event that's happening right now.

190
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,070
Right. They both see that event. Okay. So this is so important for example,

191
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,010
when we're trying to figure out, um,

192
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,710
non-event volatility and forward volatility, right?

193
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,090
When we're trying to calculate, calculate,

194
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:28,060
let's say the implied move number for a stock before the earnings event. Right.

195
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,320
That's so crucial. Um, so this is,

196
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,560
this is why guys we see the term structure move down like this. Okay.

197
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,390
Because this right here is the volatility is going to mean revert to the average

198
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:51,270
of 2%. There's so many days of 2% that that 10% move becomes less significant.

199
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,870
Exactly. Right. In the long, like imagine this, right? Like, um,

200
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,810
you want to pull up the S and P 500 and, and show like how, uh,

201
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,010
the big drops don't even show on the long, long, long, long term. Oh yeah.

202
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,410
Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, actually I got, uh, yeah, I got a good idea here.

203
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:17,160
So look at this guys. Okay. If I go, if I go here and I go, can I go one year?

204
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,100
Okay. And we look at the 20 day. So actually we go,

205
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,280
let me go a little longer here. Cause we have COVID in it. Yeah.

206
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,040
Okay. So the blue, the purple line guys. It came in second, Neil.

207
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,190
What'd he say? He said,

208
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,950
I bet you didn't even win the national math competition in China. It's a,

209
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,210
it's a big, short record. Got it. Got it. Okay guys. So here is, um,

210
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,920
the 20 day realized volatility 20 day. Now let's look at the range of this.

211
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,420
It goes up to 60%. I guess all the way up here, let's say 200,

212
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:11,740
100% and as low as nine or 10%. So that's the range, 200% or 100% to 10%. Okay.

213
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,860
Now let's look at a 252 day realized volatility.

214
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,580
Let's do that. You put 2,500.

215
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,360
I'll look at it. It doesn't go above 40%.

216
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,570
So imagine you saw a 200 day implied move, implied volatility of 100%, right?

217
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,980
It'd be an easy sell, but that, that is why guys,

218
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,040
the volatilities mean reverting, right? In the long run volatility,

219
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
we're still on whiteboard. Are you joking guys?

220
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,460
Have we been on whiteboard this whole time? What? Oh dude. Okay. There we go.

221
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
Lame. Okay. We're looking down here guys. Purple line.

222
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,160
This is a 252 day volatility, right?

223
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,680
You can see that it doesn't go higher than 45%. Okay.

224
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,020
When we look at the 20 day realized volatility, it goes all the way up to 105%.

225
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,420
Okay. And this is on the S and P here. So you can see that in the long run,

226
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,780
right? Realized volatility, mean revert, and it's, it doesn't go wild, right?

227
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,160
It stays pretty tight, but in the short run it can be all over the place.

228
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,920
And that's why we see that mean reversion in the S and P. Okay.

229
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,880
You can actually see the mean reversion on this even. Yeah. Right.

230
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,620
You can see the volatility mean reverting.

231
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:54,800
Can we go back to the longer dated one? Stephen's asking.

232
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,880
So Co-op, this is not, this is not. So Co-op is saying,

233
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,560
and the Co-op is actually a really good point here.

234
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,970
Okay. Co-op has a really good point here. He says,

235
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,640
is this why tasty trade strategy works selling high IV? This is actually,

236
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,480
that's something actually really there's a big misconception there Co-op it's because

237
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,440
realized volatility is usually higher than implied volatility when it's,

238
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,900
when it's really, really high. Okay. It there's two things you're trading,

239
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,080
right?

240
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,440
There's the implied vol you're trading and the realized vol you're trading.

241
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,360
It's for a different topic. It's for a different, a different lecture,

242
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,390
but implied vol being high.

243
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:47,080
Sometimes realized vol can be even higher than that and you get screwed and it,

244
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,280
so it actually doesn't work.

245
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,260
Dylan's asking how can it be up to 100% in 20 days, but only 45% over 252 days.

246
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,340
It's because of that dilution, right? Imagine we were at a hundred percent,

247
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,350
right? Think about, think about this at 100% implied volatility.

248
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:12,200
The market is implying that the S and P is going to move at 6.25% per day for the

249
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,260
duration of the contract.

250
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:22,070
Imagine if the S and P moved at 6.25% per day for a year that doesn't exist,

251
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,070
right? So that's why the market's never implying that. Right. But if we did,

252
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,250
you know, 40 divided by 16,

253
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,950
2.5% given the fact that it's going to move like crazy right now for at least the

254
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,640
next 20 days, isn't it realistic that this might happen over the, over a year,

255
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,510
right? Going back down to a reasonable number,

256
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,690
still taking into account the fact, right,

257
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,090
this is not discounting the fact that we're having crazy volatility right now.

258
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,930
It's saying, is it, you know,

259
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,500
what is that volatility going to look like over a longer period of time? Right.

260
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,030
It's like, um, you know,

261
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,970
something bad happens in your life and right now it's really, really rough,

262
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,850
but you're going to mean revert to a, probably a particular level of happiness,

263
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,710
right? You know,

264
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,930
you wouldn't expect that to be the level of unhappiness you have for the next 40

265
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,130
years, you know, or if something great happens and you get a nice dopamine hit,

266
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,990
you know, maybe your, your, your one day top, uh, you know,

267
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,650
expiration option would be extremely high IV, but long run,

268
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,850
you probably mean revert in some way. Okay.

269
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,390
So we're going to show you guys how it actually changes. What actually,

270
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,220
what actually happens. We're actually gonna go through the,

271
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,020
through the numbers.

272
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Okay. So volatility moves in square root time.

273
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,540
And you're actually going to see that if you guys do it,

274
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,280
if you look at the Vega for each expiration,

275
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,310
it actually moves in square root time. Okay.

276
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,690
There's actually a fascinating thing when I first found out about it.

277
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,860
So let's say guys, the 12 month, we're going to, we're going to look at,

278
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,210
pretend that we're looking at monthlies the 12 month.

279
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,850
So the one year option move because volatility is also calculated annualized.

280
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,940
So let's say that's all good. Keep going. Yeah. Okay. Let's say,

281
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,470
I'm just gonna jump on here. Okay. So let's say, so here's the month. Okay.

282
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:28,590
So we have 12 months. We have actually let's do one month, two months. Okay.

283
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:40,560
We're gonna go all the way down to 12 and let's say the 12 month contract moves.

284
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,590
The implied volatility moves 2%. Okay.

285
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:56,360
This option right here is going to move to divided by square root one divided by

286
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,750
12 first month of 12 equals.

287
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:12,160
Okay. If this moves to, the front month is going to move 6.9%.

288
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,260
We can bring that all the way down.

289
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,020
Oops.

290
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:30,250
So this one would be two divided by square root two over 12. Oh yeah.

291
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm thinking in our, okay. Let's see if I can copy that now.

292
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,960
You can, you can, you can do like a, actually a good idea of bringing all down.

293
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,660
They just change the one number. So you keep talking. I'll do this. Yeah. Okay.

294
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,840
So this is how volatility actually moves and it's actually to a science, right?

295
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,020
And there's actually a lot of guys out there who fade these moves where it doesn't

296
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,320
move in square root time. Okay. So if you're seeing the S and P 500,

297
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,560
for example, it doesn't move square root time.

298
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,420
You actually have these guys that fade that move. Now,

299
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,280
sometimes though there can be kinks, right? Like imagine, for example,

300
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,390
there's an event right here. Well, now it's going to kink like, like, uh,

301
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,790
I can't, I can't really kink my, uh, my forearm, you know,

302
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,030
it's going to kink up a bit, right. Just in this spot.

303
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,440
And it doesn't make sense for this to move up. Okay.

304
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
So only this back half would get elevated.

305
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,260
And so we're going to graph this out here. Okay. So this,

306
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,300
where's the chart insert right here.

307
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,780
Okay. So there you go. We get a 2% shift in the back,

308
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:50,540
and this is how the whole term structure is actually going to move just like that.

309
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,350
And I'm sure you guys are asking me how, why in heaven's name,

310
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,790
does it move square root time? Who's got the answer?

311
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,060
Who's got the answer? Why does volatility move square root time?

312
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm going to be super excited when Steve says this,

313
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,450
who's got it. Who's got the, who's got the sauce.

314
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,310
I don't think any of the boys got it here. Come on guys. You got the sauce.

315
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,620
Let's do it. Okay. Neil, my man, right?

316
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,490
Volatility equals daily move times square root time,

317
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,130
right? Volatility moves in a square root fashion.

318
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:52,020
Okay. So that is why we see this, right? And that's what Neil is saying.

319
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,820
There's 252 trading days in a year.

320
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,210
So we have that that's volatility.

321
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,980
And remember the reason it's one year is everything's quoted annually.

322
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:11,960
If it was quoted in two years, it would be 504. Wouldn't be 252. I mean,

323
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,580
I guess FSU isn't a, isn't really that bad after all.

324
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,300
They're keeping you at least a little bit sharp. Okay.

325
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,590
So now that we have that guys, what time we got here? 830. Okay.

326
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,250
Now that we have this and it's all recorded, so you have to go back, you know,

327
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,770
and, and, and, and re-listen to it. That's totally fine. Also guys,

328
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,850
if you want to ask some questions along the way, do so right now. And we'll,

329
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,610
as I continue, we will, Sean and I will get back to them.

330
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:50,390
Where to here? Yeah. I was going to show the terminal. Okay. Do it up. Yeah.

331
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,370
So let's say,

332
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,190
I guess we start with a discussion about what can we do with this information?

333
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,290
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. I'll show an event here.

334
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,430
How it can be priced into an event. So yeah,

335
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,780
actually that's the best way to explain it. Okay guys. So let's,

336
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,110
let's take a look here. Okay. Let's say we have, okay,

337
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,660
let's say this was 10. Okay. Sorry guys.

338
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,800
We're going to get some numbers to work with here. So,

339
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,160
so it makes a lot more sense.

340
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,450
Okay.

341
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,480
So what does this look like guys? Let me, let me delete this here.

342
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,350
Right.

343
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:48,890
So we've populated a new implied volatility forecast for each of the months where

344
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,750
the back month is implying 20%. So when do,

345
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,120
when do we see this guys who wants to say it? When do we, when do we see this?

346
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,660
We see the market fear. Yes. Earnings a hundred percent, right?

347
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,300
We see when there's an event, this could be an election, right?

348
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,160
We see this could be COVID could be COVID right. When,

349
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,370
when something's happening right now or if something's about to happen, right.

350
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,430
The market is future looking.

351
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,110
So it's either happening right this second or it's about to happen.

352
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,330
So earnings event, any, any election you know,

353
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,070
any type of severe volatility like COVID you know, the, the,

354
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,950
the 2008 crash you know, any event,

355
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,130
any event that's happening right now or that's about to happen.

356
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:50,580
Right. So how do we calculate what is implied here? Okay.

357
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,520
How do we calculate what this big move is going to be?

358
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,170
Well, to do this,

359
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:05,180
we need to figure out what the event is going to be or what's going to happen after

360
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,740
the event. Okay. What's going to happen after the event. So let me,

361
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,880
let me start drawing on here. Okay.

362
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,540
So let's say the event is happening tomorrow. So this is the one month option.

363
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
Okay. This is the two month option.

364
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,430
The event is tomorrow. Well, after let's say the event goes away afterwards.

365
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,220
Okay. Let, let, let's, let's pretend we're looking at election fall. Okay.

366
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,580
Right now we're looking at election ball after the election is done,

367
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:45,060
vols vols over. Okay. So in order to be able to, you know, calculate this,

368
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,040
we need to find out what is the volatility after the event after when the event

369
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,160
is gone. So let me ask you guys this question. Okay. Where is there no event?

370
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,100
Where is there no event?

371
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,040
Event is everywhere. Yes. Okay. Steven event is everywhere.

372
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,460
So that's good that you said that, but now this is a little bit deep thinking.

373
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,260
Okay. And I'm also, you know, I know, I know this is gold guys. Um,

374
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,550
but where is there actually no event. Okay.

375
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,870
And there is somewhere where there's no event.

376
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,940
Let's see who can get this. Okay. Before the event. Yes. Somewhere in the past.

377
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,580
Yes. Yes. But we're looking here. We're looking here.

378
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,280
I know this is guys a little bit, um, higher level thinking, right.

379
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
And we're all going to get there. So please don't be discouraged.

380
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,880
But what do you guys think?

381
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,780
Let's give them a second here. See if they can really think about this one.

382
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:55,860
Buyout way out in the future. Okay. No, one's got it. It's between events.

383
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,320
Sorry. Between expirations. Is there an event between here?

384
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,720
Right. If the event is here, all of these see it,

385
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,300
but is there an event between these days? Is there an event between these days?

386
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,970
There's not, there's no event there.

387
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:25,960
Okay. And that is how we figure out non event volatility. Okay.

388
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,480
We say we count, and then this is called forward volatility. Okay.

389
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:36,180
We calculate what is the volatility between these expirations.

390
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,640
And once we figure that out, we have now figured out non event volatility.

391
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,140
Okay. Now I'm sure you guys are saying like Jordan, what the hell?

392
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,120
I'm not a math geek. No problem. No problem.

393
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,320
This is where predicting alpha comes in handy. Okay. So we're going to,

394
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,460
we're going to do an example here.

395
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,180
I hope you guys are excited about this because like this stuff really gets me really

396
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,630
gets my rocks off, really gets Sean's rocks off too. Right. This is where,

397
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,540
and this is stuff that can make you money. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Right.

398
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,480
So how can we make money?

399
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,460
So we're going to go and we're going to talk about that right now.

400
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,150
Open in browser. Yeah. Good. Yeah.

401
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,260
All right, guys, let me share my screen.

402
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,590
This is why Jordan is single. Jordan has more models than all of us guys.

403
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,980
Guys. So this is where predicting alpha comes in. Okay.

404
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,680
So we got something called event vol calculator. I know you guys, I know,

405
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,240
right. I know you guys are excited. I'm excited too. Sean is fucking Sean.

406
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,480
You know, when I showed Sean, Sean would calculate event vol like this.

407
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,040
I was like, Oh my God, he creamed himself. All right. So we're going to,

408
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,280
let's take a look here guys. Okay.

409
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,380
So let's say we're going to go back to our example here. We have 69% for now.

410
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,600
I would love that number. 69% for the first month option.

411
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh, here it is. Okay. So I vol front month expiration. Okay. 69%. Okay.

412
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,480
In the back month, right over here. Right.

413
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,160
So what we're looking at here guys is we are trying to calculate what is in being

414
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,920
implied in the options market. Okay.

415
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:45,190
About this event that's coming up tomorrow or on November 3rd. And to do this,

416
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,910
we have to figure out the implied volatility between expirations.

417
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,260
So let's go ahead and head over to the terminal.

418
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:03,860
So we got 69% for the first month, 49% for the second month. So here we go.

419
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:12,210
49% and days to expiration we're going to say is 30 days. Okay. So go 1120.

420
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,730
And we will go December 20 or December 18th. Okay.

421
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,880
And now we're going to calculate. So in this case,

422
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,310
the forward volatility would be only 6.4%,

423
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:48,200
which is absurd because I

424
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,340
moved it too much in the back.

425
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,520
Sorry guys. Something's off with that. Maybe it's in the back end here still,

426
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,980
but anyways,

427
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,890
yeah. Unless it's, well, you know why.

428
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:31,860
Okay. There we go. Okay. Cause for, I was putting in the second month as the,

429
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,800
as the first month. So let's say we were looking at something like this. Okay.

430
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,600
So here we have the forward volatility as 48%. Okay.

431
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,310
So that's actually going to be the volatility once the expiration comes down.

432
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,170
Right. Once the event's gone, the volatility in the front month. Okay.

433
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,820
So this is going to drop from 69 to 49 or 48. Okay.

434
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
So once we have that, once we know that, okay,

435
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,600
well the front is going to drop from 69 to 48 and that's the non-event volatility.

436
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,280
Right. So the back is probably a drop from 48 to maybe let's say 35. Right.

437
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,320
And we can calculate that. If we look at the next two expirations. Okay.

438
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:19,130
Then we can plug that in here. So we can say the non-event vol is 48. Okay.

439
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,520
But the expiration vol is 69.

440
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,300
Okay. And the expiration we're looking at is 1023, which is today.

441
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,740
Okay. So out would come. The implied move is only 2%.

442
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,290
Okay. So this is how options work through time.

443
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,240
I'm almost certain I have a bug in here somewhere. All right, dude.

444
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,700
Give me one second. Can you,

445
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,840
can you explain this last part again one more time quickly? Yeah. One second.

446
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,330
Oh, you know what? One second, guys.

447
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,710
Don't change this because it's for the previous example.

448
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,370
I just posted it to our stories. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry guys.

449
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:12,430
Give me one second. Okay. Go. So the implied move for this expiration, right.

450
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,150
For this event that we're looking at is 2% and all of the options across the board

451
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,570
are going to see that 2% move. Just some of them,

452
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,970
the longer dated ones are going to be diluted. Okay.

453
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:30,060
So that is the implied move and for volatility calculation. Now,

454
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,090
okay, here we go guys. I don't know what happened there. Not too sure.

455
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,110
So you have 69, 48. Okay. We have front month,

456
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,070
which is one month out and back month, which is two months out.

457
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,810
We calculate it and the forward volatility is 25%. Okay.

458
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,450
This makes a lot more sense guys. No bugs. We're good.

459
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:07,780
Here's the front month, which is 69%. Here's the back month. Which is 48%.

460
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,080
We calculate for volatility. That's 25%. That's where the non-event vol is.

461
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,040
So we have 25%. It's going to be a big implied move number.

462
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,640
We have 69% for the total volatility. And then we have 1120. We calculate it.

463
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,880
Boom. So now the implied move is actually 14% and the event volatility is 341.

464
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,170
Okay.

465
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,760
So that is, that is your, our first lesson on event vol,

466
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,900
non-event volatility for volatility and calendar spreads. Right.

467
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,320
And we can trade. Oh, I guess we didn't get,

468
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,640
we didn't really touch on calendar spreads.

469
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,280
Calendar spreads can take advantage of that, right?

470
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,120
Calendar spreads can take advantage of the mispriced,

471
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:02,660
the mispriced expirations. Okay. Let's say for example,

472
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:09,960
you think that in one month, okay, here's a perfect example with JD. Okay.

473
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,500
Neil's JD. You think that the back month, once earnings is confirmed,

474
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,550
this back month implied vol is going to increase. Okay.

475
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,590
From let's say 48 to 60. Okay.

476
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,460
Well, you have to basically price out. Well, how's my asset going to change?

477
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,240
How's my calendar spread going to change? Right. And lucky for you guys,

478
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:41,510
we got, you know, we built out, it's crazy, man.

479
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,650
Every time there's always a new bug. Yeah.

480
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,320
As soon as you like go in and share it with someone, it bugs out.

481
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,050
Man.

482
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,460
But anyways, guys, so that is our that's our first introduction to part one.

483
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,980
How volatility moves through time. Okay. Let's stop the recording here.
