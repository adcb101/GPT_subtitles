1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,340
All right. So in today's live,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,280
we're going to be talking about volatility as synthetic time.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,860
I know it sounds like a big word, but it's not. And also how that impacts,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,960
okay, let's say us taking a trade before earnings, right?

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,520
So just to give a little bit of a backdrop,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,400
we're talking with Ron in our group here, and he placed a trade on Netflix,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,760
okay? He sold some vol on Netflix. And, you know,

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,260
he's sold quite a bit of VEGA, right?

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,710
But what happened was his P&L is barely moving day in, day out, right?

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,150
It's like up 10 bucks, down 10 bucks, up 10 bucks for, you know,

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,970
a straddle that should be moving hundreds of dollars, right?

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,330
And so in this live, we're gonna explain why that's the case, why that happens.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,130
And I think you guys, it will open your mind. It will open your mind up a lot,

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,950
in my opinion. When I first learned this, it was like,

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,190
and this is maybe like two years ago when I first learned this. I was like,

16
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:10,250
wow, okay, wow, is what I said. So hopefully, you know,

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,970
everybody at the end of this live drop a wow in the chat. Yeah. Okay, guys,

18
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,850
so I'm gonna draw on the board here. Let me know if you guys can see.

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,490
Let me get a darker marker, actually. You know, dark black here.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,960
I got it. You got it? Oh, no, that's a line. You know what,

21
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,660
dark blue should be good. Dark blue will be fine. If you guys can't see it,

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,330
just let me know and we'll change that. Okay, so imagine you have a stock,

23
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,800
okay? The stock's traveling like this, okay? And it stops right here, okay?

24
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:53,160
And let's say that this stock can only do one of two things, okay?

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,030
It can only do one of two things. Tomorrow, it can go up 1%, okay?

26
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,180
So we'll call that plus 1%. Let me do that a different color, actually.

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:12,280
I'll do that green. So it can go up 1%, okay? Or it can go down 1%, okay?

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,900
What volatility is this? Who's gonna tell me what vol is this?

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,480
If you go up 1% or down 1%, what's the vol?

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,500
Right, if the stock can go up 1% or down 1%, so the volatility would be?

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,540
The one-day IV. Yeah, or the vol. Let's say this stock is,

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,000
we're gonna look at it for 30 days into the future, okay?

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:46,010
And it can only move up or down 1%, okay? It's gonna be? Yes, someone said it.

34
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,380
Excellent, 16%. There we go, Stephen said it. Thank you, Stephen. Okay, now,

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,980
so this is gonna be the movement tomorrow, either up to 1% or down 1%. Now,

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,240
let's say we take this path, okay? We go up 1% tomorrow. Well, the next day,

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,260
okay, we can either go up another percent again, or we can come down a percent,

38
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,800
okay? So that's another plus 1, and this is a minus 1.

39
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,220
And we went down this path, right? We can either go up 1 or down 1, okay?

40
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,790
Now, if we continue this pattern, okay? We're gonna do four timestamps.

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,240
We're just gonna do four timestamps, okay? If we continue this pattern,

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,260
it's gonna look like this, okay? Another one, and then another one, okay?

43
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,520
So this is one path, okay? It's gonna look like a tree, okay?

44
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,090
Bear with me, guys, while I quickly draw this out,

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,960
okay?

46
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,810
Okay, you guys see this? This is all the different types of paths. One, two,

47
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,230
three, four, yeah, okay. We'll just call it this.

48
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:18,010
This is all the different paths that this stock can take, okay? Now, at 16 vol,

49
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,530
so realizing 16 vol, okay? These are the different paths.

50
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:32,630
So the stock might end up up 4%, okay? It might go up three, it might go up 4%.

51
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,010
Oh, one, two, three, four. It might go up 3%, then down one.

52
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,570
Whatever, we're just gonna go like this. 3%, yeah, okay, 2%, okay? Zero,

53
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,810
negative two, and 4%, negative 4%, okay? And obviously- Tree's not perfect,

54
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,570
we missed a couple of spots. Yeah, we missed a couple of spots.

55
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,570
Tree's not perfect, but anyways,

56
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,830
we're gonna be basically between 4% and negative 4%.

57
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,750
That's where we're gonna end up in four days.

58
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,710
Now, this is volatility 16%, okay? Four days, anywhere,

59
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,120
we're gonna be on this tree, okay? Now, what if we double vol?

60
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:27,340
What if we double vol to 32%, okay? So now, here's our stock, okay?

61
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,490
You want another color? No, that's okay, I got it. Actually, yeah, actually,

62
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:31,750
I got it.

63
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,220
So we double vol now, and vol is at 32, okay?

64
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, now, what can this do tomorrow? What can this one do tomorrow? Okay,

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:06:02,330
someone says it perfectly. It can either go up 2% or down 2%, okay?

66
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,370
And then the next day,

67
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:13,450
it's gonna go either up another 2% or it's gonna go down another 2%, right?

68
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,490
And this could go down 2% like this, and this could go like this, okay?

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,450
Okay, we're gonna leave it like that, but basically, we'll call it this, okay?

70
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:33,090
So it's gonna be either plus 4% or it's gonna be minus 4% in two days, okay?

71
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,870
Now, both of these ended up in the same spot. One, however,

72
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:47,700
ended up quicker than this one, right? So what happened here? In this,

73
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,620
we increased time and dropped vol, and to get the same result here,

74
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:06,070
we drop time and increase vol, okay? So we can say here, okay, that volatility,

75
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:13,440
you guys, here's the wow moment. Volatility equals time,

76
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:25,070
okay? Increasing volatility is equivalent to increasing time, okay?

77
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,250
Increasing volatility is equivalent to increasing time.

78
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,760
So why do we wanna know this? So first off, is everyone okay with that?

79
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,080
Does everyone understand that? An increasing volatility, okay,

80
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,040
is the same thing as if we increase time, okay? Very cool, very, very cool.

81
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,270
So Eric's saying because it offsets theta.

82
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,430
So this is basically, okay, so what we just did here, guys,

83
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,620
is called a binomial tree, okay?

84
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,420
And this is just saying all the different combinations. Yes,

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,180
as we increase implied volatility, what happens to theta, right?

86
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,240
So as we increase implied vol, theta drops. And what's theta?

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,520
Our exposure to time, okay? Oh, sorry, guys. Yes, yes, yes, okay?

88
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,260
As implied vol goes up, our sensitivity to the decay decreases, okay?

89
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,560
But theta increases, like the actual overall theta in our portfolio, right?

90
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,760
How much the extrinsic value, not the theta, my apologies,

91
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,330
the extrinsic value increases, okay? So volatility equals time. Now,

92
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,610
why is this important, okay? Why is this important?

93
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,490
So everyone's okay with this? I'm gonna erase this.

94
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,580
Looks good. Okay, great.

95
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,640
So why is this important? Well, let's go back to Ronnie's situation, right?

96
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,020
Ronnie's situation,

97
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,760
Ronnie's situation was, he had a iron condor on, right? And here's today, okay?

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,670
Here's our timeline. And here's the event. Now, for an earnings event, okay?

99
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,440
Earnings event's right over here. Or sorry, let's say earnings event is right,

100
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,660
sorry. Let's say, so here's today, here's 30 days from now, okay? T plus 30.

101
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,310
And here's the earnings event right here, okay? Today,

102
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,370
earnings event right here. And well,

103
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,210
if we graphed out the implied move for every single day along this graph,

104
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,780
and let's say we're looking at Tesla, because Tesla's earnings coming up, okay?

105
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,340
It's gonna be 3% move here, 3% move here, right? Et cetera, et cetera,

106
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,290
et cetera. 12% move, 3% move, 3%. Okay?

107
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,440
This is what the option for Tesla is gonna be implying, right? Non-event vol,

108
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,910
non-event vol, big event right here. John, do you know if the glow? Yeah,

109
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,890
it'll be okay. Yeah, have you ever watched it like in real time?

110
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,220
Yeah.

111
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:32,880
Okay.

112
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,220
That's good. It is what it is. It is what it is, yeah. 3%, 3%, 12%, 3%, 3%.

113
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,740
So what's happening here, right? What's happening here? Well,

114
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:55,030
this event here is increasing implied volatility, right? Meaning,

115
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,030
what does that mean, guys? If implied volatility is increasing here,

116
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
what is this equivalent to?

117
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,070
What is this equivalent to?

118
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,190
Time. Thank you. It's equivalent to time increasing.

119
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,290
It's equivalent to time increasing. Implied vol goes up,

120
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,940
is exactly the same as if there was more time on the option, right?

121
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,360
And just to solidify it, if we have an option that let's say is 10 DTE, okay?

122
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,840
With implied volatility of let's say 30%, okay?

123
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:42,200
And let's say there's an option all the way over here with 30% as well, okay?

124
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:50,160
And 120 DTE, okay? Well, imagine this option, okay?

125
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:57,120
Imagine this option had let's say $10 of theta a day, okay? So every day,

126
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,400
it lost $10 of theta.

127
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,530
If we jack up the vols, okay? If we jack up the vols on this,

128
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,390
theta is gonna increase, okay? Because we have more to lose now, okay?

129
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,870
But the different paths that can go, right? It becomes larger.

130
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,550
It becomes larger.

131
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,370
Just like how this one is gonna have a larger move as well because of that time,

132
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,650
okay? Because of that time element, right?

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,580
Increasing the implied volatility here, increase the width it can move, right?

134
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,280
And if we go all the way to back 120 days, well,

135
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,920
there was already a big move like this implied in, right? Right,

136
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,400
so before it was here, like this is the possible tree combos.

137
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,380
And now it's like this, which is equivalent to something that was back here.

138
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,400
Okay, do we all understand that? So what happened here,

139
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,150
what's happening with Ronnie here is when this jacks up, right?

140
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:13,140
When the implied vol is jacking up, increasing the time, all of a sudden, okay?

141
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,680
All of a sudden, our daily theta, right? What guys,

142
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,700
what does a longer DTE option look like in terms of gamma, right?

143
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,600
What does it look like? There's like zero gamma, right?

144
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
There's zero gamma here.

145
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,570
Go out in time guys and look at a 250 day option, look at the gamma on it,

146
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,110
okay? Jack up the implied vols on a 10 DTE option,

147
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,590
and you're gonna see it go from this,

148
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,580
okay? To this, to this brown line right here. Okay, the gamma is gonna drop.

149
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:08,490
So what this is telling us here is our P and L is gonna be more flat, right?

150
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,490
If we have less gamma, right? We're gonna be, imagine guys,

151
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,630
a product that had no gamma and no delta. It would just be like this.

152
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,840
A straight line. And so that is what's happening with Ronnie's position here.

153
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,200
All the P and L, okay? Because of this massive event,

154
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:36,400
the gamma is so low and the theta ratios are so low for these parts, right?

155
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,340
That most of our P and L is gonna be dictated,

156
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,940
especially in terms of theta and gamma right here, okay? Right from this event.

157
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,010
Does that make sense?

158
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,850
Does that make sense? So our day-to-day P and L here,

159
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,950
this day and this day and this day, is gonna be very low, right? Of course,

160
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,690
if implied vol drops, we're gonna make money,

161
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,670
but we're not gonna make barely any money from our theta. Okay?

162
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,150
And definitely we're not gonna be making any money from our gamma,

163
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,560
okay? Because this implied vol basically created,

164
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,240
this huge move here basically created an option that would be equivalent to,

165
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,130
if there was no event here, a much longer DTE option, okay?

166
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:41,440
And so we have to now wait for this event, okay? Now, in terms of,

167
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,120
let's say an event like Tesla, where when we were short vol,

168
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,980
even though we were short February around the event, right?

169
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,560
It was because of this.

170
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,700
We saw a lot of P and L there because this is what was implied, right?

171
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,500
And we thought that these were gonna go down to let's say 3%, right?

172
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,910
The non-event vol was gonna get crushed. Yeah, exactly.

173
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:15,590
Maybe an easy way to visualize that is if you were to kind of graph what the implied

174
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:22,430
vol should look like for Tesla, right? Let's say this is Jan here, Feb here,

175
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,370
and then March here, and the event is right here.

176
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,640
Implied vol should look like this, right? Maybe something like this, right?

177
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,620
Or realized vol and implied. But then the market changed and implied this.

178
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,600
So the event became way more diluted in the individual day, right?

179
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,460
The non-event vol raised.

180
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,320
So the event vol became less significant in terms of what dictates your day-to-day

181
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,380
P and L of this two-month option,

182
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
right?

183
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,670
Does that make sense? And obviously- And then I guess to wrap that up,

184
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,730
if you wanna give me the brown one, actually. To wrap that up,

185
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,630
what we were betting on was not really this.

186
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,900
We were betting on this coming down back to a more reasonable level.

187
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,470
Just to wrap that up. But our theta here,

188
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,800
our theta and gamma for each day is gonna be minimal.

189
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,360
It's gonna be almost nothing because what's the theta and gamma of a 300-day option?

190
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,220
It's basically nothing, right?

191
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:42,160
So this straddle that Ronald has on is really only gonna make money after,

192
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:50,740
or lose money after the event, right? Or if non-event vol collapses, right?

193
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,020
Or increases.

194
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,880
But you're not gonna realize any P and L from the day-to-day movement because a

195
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,200
longer-dated option is not gonna realize any P and L from a day-to-day movement.

196
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,680
Maybe show how... Well,

197
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,080
the reason Ronnie took this trade is because he looked at the terminal and he saw

198
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,600
implied vol at 100, forecast at like 80.

199
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,100
So maybe talk about how this all goes together to formulate the implied vol that

200
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,300
you see. Yes. So we're gonna be averaging it and stuff. So volatility, guys.

201
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,320
Okay, so the volatility is going to be the average of these, okay?

202
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,360
So it's actually the averages of the variance, but we're not gonna go there.

203
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,060
You basically would squarely- Do like a four-day option to show it. Okay.

204
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,360
And you know what, guys? Here, here's another way to think about it as well,

205
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,100
right? As implied vol is volatility synthetic time.

206
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,540
We can take this 12% and break it up into two days, right? Where we now have,

207
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,540
let's say, two 6% moves, right?

208
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,570
So that's how we just broke down that 12% to two 6% days.

209
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,390
And just to solidify how volatility is equivalent to synthetic time.

210
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,000
That's good. So you can erase that out, I guess. Yeah, yeah.

211
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,080
I think that's good for the averages. Yeah,

212
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,580
but show how it becomes the annualized implied vol of the actual option. Okay.

213
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:33,490
Okay. Just to make sure it's solid. Super brief. Okay, so if we have,

214
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,670
let's say, 1% day,

215
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,190
then let's say negative 1%, or actually, sorry,

216
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,020
let's say every single day is implying for easy, yeah, I guess for easy. Yeah,

217
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,100
do no event and with event. Okay, 1%, 1%.

218
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,380
You gotta work on your way. Oh, man, I know. Okay.

219
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:04,840
Okay, let's say it's 1%, okay, for day one, okay? And then 1% for day two,

220
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,680
and then 4% for day three, okay?

221
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:19,540
The volatility for the formula for the option is going to be, right,

222
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,220
so the volatility here is gonna be 16. Well, first,

223
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,560
we'll take the average of these, okay? Let's take the average of these.

224
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,870
And the average is six divided by, so it's 3%. Okay, we multiply three by 16.

225
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,690
Okay, we get 48. Okay, so that's gonna be the vol of the option.

226
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,930
Okay, so you can see how this one big event here,

227
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,280
you know, changes the option implied volatility.

228
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,820
Yes, Brian, that is correct.

229
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,120
I said six divided by three was three.

230
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,850
Okay, there we go. Okay, so this is how we get the volatility, right?

231
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,950
And the trip up that people make is they sell this, right?

232
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,010
Like this is where it gets tricky, right? They sell 32%.

233
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,780
Let's say the market is spot on. Well, on this day, day one,

234
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,120
they only realized 16%, Paul. Day two, they only realized 16%, Paul.

235
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,700
And all of a sudden you're seeing the one, what the hell's going on?

236
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,700
This thing is way expensive.

237
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,720
We're not realizing anything and I'm not making money.

238
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,900
And the whole point of this demonstration and looking at that event in that 30 day

239
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,960
option from before is to understand that this is why, right? In that pricing,

240
00:21:52,060 --> 00:22:00,240
that 32 vol is this 4% day, right? So sure, we've had 1%, 1%.

241
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,350
It's less than 32% implied vol, but we have this day that we need to really,

242
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,710
that things make a lot more sense once we're aware of it and its impact on the option.

243
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,310
We're all good for questions. Okay, perfect.

244
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,670
So do we have any questions about this?

245
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,830
We gotta get better topics, man. Everyone's falling asleep. Yeah. Once again,

246
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,770
co-hosting, how do I profit from this? Well, cool. You sell, if, cool, cool.

247
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,430
It's a good question. Cool. If this, let's say, you know,

248
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,930
let's say you think the implied move should be 10%, right? Well,

249
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,270
then you would want to be buying these options, right?

250
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,250
And if let's say it's 2%, you know, you think the actual, what it should be,

251
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,420
you can be selling these, right? And well, actually,

252
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,400
I think it's time to bust out the three circles.

253
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,960
We can talk about the three circles here. I guess. If you have a view, right?

254
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,040
Remember your three circles co-op, right? And then draw on the level, right?

255
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,650
We have event vol, non-event vol, and market vol, right?

256
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:25,380
Let's say we have an option here that vol looks like this, let's say.

257
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,700
But I'm gonna use my little graph, right? Let's say this is a 30-day option.

258
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,040
There's an earnings event here.

259
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,870
And let's say implied volatility looks like this,

260
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,440
all right? We're expecting a big move on the earnings day.

261
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,120
And this is the implied non-event volatility, all right?

262
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,170
If you think that volatility looks, should look like this,

263
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,560
well, it kind of makes more sense. You really,

264
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,980
what you think is inefficient is this.

265
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,860
So it makes sense for you to enter here and exit here, right?

266
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:16,370
You don't have a view on this, but let's say that implied,

267
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,270
let's say that the implied volatility looks like this,

268
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,610
and you think that it should actually look like this.

269
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,600
Well, now you don't just have a view on this.

270
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,840
You don't just think this is inefficient.

271
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,100
You actually think the non-event and the event volatility is overpriced.

272
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,340
Being short vol from today now makes sense because not only do you expect this to

273
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,840
come down or this to be less or realize less, you expect this to realize less,

274
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,660
this to realize less. And all of a sudden trading this 30-day,

275
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,920
even with this event in the middle makes a lot more sense.

276
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,560
This is what we did for Tesla, right? We sold a February vol back in December.

277
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,660
We sold February vol because we didn't think this was overpriced.

278
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,300
We thought this was actually overpriced and this was overpriced, right?

279
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,300
So we could sell a whole event, right? It depends what you have if you want.

280
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,780
Cohen, does that answer your question? And no, Bron,

281
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,940
so what we're saying is he was betting that the realized volatility,

282
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,720
he wasn't betting on the level of implied vol.

283
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:33,550
He was betting on the realized volatility being less than the implied vol.

284
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,840
But here's the thing, right? We'll go this quickly one more time, right? Well,

285
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,540
as many times as we need to, we'll make sure that we get it.

286
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,960
So here's the thing,

287
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:50,200
right? Implied vol looked like this, right? There's the event here, right?

288
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,180
This is Netflix. This is Ronnie's Trade here.

289
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,250
And because this move, so Netflix is implying like a pretty big movement.

290
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,730
I can't remember what it is, but they have this big move implied, right?

291
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:11,890
So let's say this, the non-event vol, the non-event vol would be 30%, okay?

292
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:19,010
And the event vol is, let's say, 70%, okay? Or like 100%. Well,

293
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:25,050
when we take all this into account, all of a sudden, the implied vol is maybe,

294
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,430
let's say, 45% or something. I'm making up these numbers, right?

295
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:37,050
Implied vol is 45%. So this is what is actually going into this implied vol.

296
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,430
But what Ronnie was seeing when he looked at the implied vol was this.

297
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,600
He was thinking that it looked like this because,

298
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,500
and this is what we went over on the call with him,

299
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,120
was that it doesn't actually look like this. It looks like this,

300
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:59,190
and this big day is giving the illusion of this at a first glance, right?

301
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,810
And then all of a sudden,

302
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,310
it starts realizing what the market actually implied for this non-event vol.

303
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:13,410
And Ronnie's saying, well, what the hell? It's implying 45, it's realizing 30,

304
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,360
and I'm not making money. So go back to your question there,

305
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,300
whatchamacallit, Braun. The event's not necessarily priced in.

306
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,320
The event just hasn't happened yet. And that's where, what is this?

307
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,810
Have a good laugh. All right, right, and this is, you know. You guys are,

308
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,150
you guys are fine. Okay, you guys get what's going on here.

309
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:54,530
Yeah, so this big event. This real big event. This big event here was, guys,

310
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,360
was basically skewing all the data, right? But do you guys see how,

311
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,280
when we broke that down into two pieces there,

312
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,000
what was actually being implied and what was actually being realized?

313
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Okay.

314
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,690
Hey, Hutch, wow, I've seen Hutch here, amazing.

315
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,980
So that is what Ronnie was seeing for his trade and why he was like,

316
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,400
not understanding why his P&L wasn't coming in as much as he thought it would have.

317
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,270
Okay,

318
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,540
so any questions about time as a synthetic volatility or volatility as synthetic

319
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:48,920
time? And the non-event vol versus the event vol. Any questions about that?

320
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,760
Swati's saying, how does this change? If on a particular day,

321
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:01,860
the vol changes like today's, NVDA Neo News changed the vol. Okay, so Swati.

322
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,120
You wanna erase everything? Actually, no, I think this is good. So this is,

323
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,640
let's say this is today, okay?

324
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,270
So actually, we don't need the screen line here.

325
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,640
Okay,

326
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,060
so Swati, let's say this is, this is what the market was implying today. Okay?

327
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,400
Now, this could change tomorrow, right? This could change tomorrow. Let's say,

328
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,120
for example, a Neo event comes out, we get new information.

329
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,780
And so now the implied volatility of the option is gonna maybe change, right?

330
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,200
Maybe they pre-released the earnings. Yeah, maybe they did something, right?

331
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,940
Maybe something came out in this newsletter and now the market is expecting,

332
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,920
okay, well, now we're gonna probably see higher vol in the next five days.

333
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,240
Then it's gonna drop off. Then it's gonna increase, right?

334
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,640
And then it's gonna have a big day up here and then it's gonna drop off again,

335
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:06,790
right? Now, we only, this is the whole path that the market sees, right?

336
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,550
And this might, this changed from yesterday to today, right? But we only,

337
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:17,930
we only see an implied volatility of let's say 80%, right?

338
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,300
We need to dig deeper and look at the lifetime of this option, right?

339
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,940
What is gonna happen over the life of this option? Where are the big events?

340
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,900
Where are the non-events?

341
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,380
And a way to see that is by looking at different expirations, okay? Now,

342
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,340
you know, we're gonna quickly go into this, but this is a gold topic.

343
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,300
We're gonna quickly jump into this, okay?

344
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,530
Let's say, for example, Swati, okay?

345
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,250
Does anyone wanna take a guess on how we can kind of guess the path of the option?

346
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,770
Does anyone wanna try to take a guess how we could view it?

347
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,830
How we could find it, figure a way out around it?

348
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:06,490
By looking at premiums, not quite, not quite. How could we, you know,

349
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,750
some deep thinking here, right?

350
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,590
How might we be able to find out the path of this, of the volatility?

351
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,310
Yeah, Jekka, it's gold. What is it? Ned and Jekka, what is it? Stephen,

352
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,490
I know Stephen knows the answer.

353
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,720
Okay, so I'm gonna let, I'll save Jekka here, Stephen, this one time.

354
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,460
But Swati, this is,

355
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,760
the way we can do that is by looking at the other expirations, right? Because,

356
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,200
sure, this is today, right? This is today, and this is 30 days from now. Well,

357
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,730
what is the one-week option implied vol? What is the two-week option, right?

358
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,400
What is the three-week, and then what is the one-month? Right,

359
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,700
because the one-month option that we're trading might be, let's say,

360
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:11,490
80% implied volatility for NEO, okay? But the one-week might be 110%, okay?

361
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,150
So if we know that in one month it's gonna be 80%,

362
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,930
and we know that the volatility is the average, right?

363
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,090
The volatility is the average. Well, if this one's already 110,

364
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:29,250
then these have to be maybe like 60 and 70, right?

365
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,900
So that's how we can see what the path is, right? So in this case,

366
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,820
it would look like this. Lot of volatility right now, then it drops off,

367
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,480
then it picks up, picks up a little more, and then flatlines. And this,

368
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:52,400
for this option that sees this whole thing, is gonna be 80% implied vol, okay?

369
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,520
But it's gonna have different paths along the way.

370
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,030
Now, this might change, though, depending on what happened, right?

371
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,080
If it's NEO day, maybe the vol's expected to be very, very high up here, right?

372
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,480
And then drop. And you know what,

373
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
why don't we show an example of this in the real option market?

374
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,900
And we'll do NEO.

375
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,220
So then hopefully it'll solidify everything we're chatting about here.

376
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,440
We just need to open up Thinkorswim. Yeah, just give us one second, guys.

377
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:31,500
Good job, Steven. Oh, Ronnie got it. Good job, Ronnie. Good job, Ronnie.

378
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,130
That's other Ronnie. Good job, Ronnie.

379
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,150
I'll give it to- Good job to both of you, anyways.

380
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,750
I'll give it to Ronnie Squared.

381
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,580
Okay, give it a second, guys. Just booting up here.

382
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,550
You guys are crazy.

383
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,150
Okay, let me share my screen.

384
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,100
Let me make sure no technical analysis on that here. Let's see. Oh,

385
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,240
no technical analysis. There's always technical analysis on there, man.

386
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Those are good. Wow. No technical analysis today, guys. So, Swati,

387
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,040
let's take a look here. Okay? So this one-week option,

388
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,480
we gotta deal with delayed data. Okay, so you can see these one-week options,

389
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,720
for example, have an implied volatility of about 120%.

390
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,720
So let's start graphing this out on the board, okay?

391
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,390
Let's start graphing this out on the board.

392
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,950
Okay, I'll flip it back and forth as we go. Okay,

393
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,290
I think it's gonna be very intuitive for you guys. Okay?

394
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:55,080
Okay, so Y-axis, volatility. X-axis, time.

395
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,240
We're gonna chunk it up by seven-day periods. One, two, three, and four, okay?

396
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:12,640
So, 120% for this one-week option. This week, okay?

397
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,570
That's the volatility the market's expecting. Let's see what the next week is.

398
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,320
Yeah.

399
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,230
111, okay?

400
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,730
111, okay?

401
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,660
I'll just leave it like this if we're going quick. Yeah. All right,

402
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,800
and then 29.

403
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,150
29, 110. So, before you flip back, before you show them that one. Yeah,

404
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,390
don't show them that one yet. Wait, is that the? This is the 29. Okay. Okay,

405
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,900
so let's see the last one.

406
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:01,320
Is this the last one here? It's the Feb 5th. So, 110, okay? So,

407
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,960
if we were to look, so here we go. We're gonna see 120 vol here, okay?

408
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:14,060
We're gonna see 115 vol here, 110 vol here, and 110 vol in this period, okay?

409
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,160
Now, here's the thing. If we only saw this, right? So,

410
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,560
if we only looked at this option, the one that sees the whole thing, right?

411
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,120
The February 5th, okay? And the February 5th we saw was 110. But the seven day,

412
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:37,120
right, was 120. So, we know that between 120 and 110, right?

413
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,040
Between seven days and 30 days,

414
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,680
it's gotta be between these two, and that's exactly what we saw, okay? Now,

415
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,420
tomorrow, some news might come out with NEO,

416
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,480
and all of a sudden the market's implying higher up here.

417
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,900
Let's say higher up here, higher up here, and higher up here. So,

418
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,250
that's how it might change tomorrow, let's say, okay?

419
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,630
Or it can come down as well. Does that make sense?

420
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,210
Sure, Aria, we'll do Bitcoin part two tomorrow. Now, you ready for it? Yeah,

421
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:18,690
I'll be ready for it. Okay. Awesome, Swati, awesome. Any more questions?

422
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,740
All right. So, in that case, we are going to wrap up the live.

423
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,000
Can we do Ethereum?

424
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,740
Andres. Andres, that's the one, eh?

425
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,760
That's the one we should have been looking at the whole time.

426
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah, we need to look at the Dogecoin, come on.
