1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,640
All right. Okay, guys. So in this lab,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,460
we're going to be talking a little bit about forward vols, where to use it,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,760
and basically what structures we need to use to take advantage of it.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,780
So we've done quite a few lives on what forward volatility is,

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,700
and you can check out the archive for that.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,260
But just we'll give a quick summary of what forward volatility is.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,200
And to do that, I'm going to share my screen. Let me make you host.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,320
Okay. Go for it. All right.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,800
All right. So what we're going to look at here, guys, is two volatilities.

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,420
Okay. We're going to look at, actually, we're going to go to block.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,540
Okay. So we're going to look at this screen right here,

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,420
where all the implied volatilities are. Okay.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,240
And what I graphed here is two volatilities.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,960
One is the implied volatility of the 30-day,

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,280
and the other is the implied volatility of the 90-day.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,310
So if we go to thinkorswim,

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,290
we have the implied volatility of, let's say, the 30-day, right?

18
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,990
And we have the implied volatility, in this case, of the 156,

19
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,430
156 days to expiration.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,080
Now these are just the regular implied volatilities.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,520
But what the forward volatility is, is the volatility between two expirations.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,280
Jordan, maybe you should share your whiteboard here and draw it out. Yeah.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,820
And also, guys, I want to keep this one a little bit exciting.

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,240
I feel like sometimes when we talk too much,

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,060
when I use the word volatility too much, people start to fall asleep.

26
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,680
So I want to keep it exciting. Okay. So you guys,

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,560
let's try to keep it pumped up here. So share your whiteboard.

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,320
And the reason that I actually, maybe not anyone else does,

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,400
but I think this is really exciting because you think you have it all figured out,

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,340
and then this whole new element comes into play. And you're like,

31
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,330
wait a minute. I'd never even thought of this before. You know what I mean,

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,570
Jordan? Yeah. And to keep it more motivating, this is rarely modeled.

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,470
So meaning there's going to be lots of alpha here, right?

34
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,610
I was telling a story the other day about how I picked up these calendars for five

35
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,470
cents, and they're worth a dollar within a couple of weeks, right?

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,770
So these things are, they're available, and it's because it's rarely modeled.

37
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,500
And in fact, Margin, one of the guys in our group, put on a trade today, WSM,

38
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,560
forward vol trade, and the number of returns he's made on that,

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,420
he's closing it out tomorrow, but it's gigantic. Okay. It's gigantic.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,020
And I'm a little upset he's not on the live today,

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,000
but you guys can reach out to him, ask him about it. Hopefully he'll post it.

42
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah. It's a forward vol play, and it's going to earn quite a bit. Okay.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,940
All right. Jordan, quickly here, let's talk about what,

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,460
like draw it out so that everyone understands what forward vol is,

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
and then let's hop right into how we trade it.

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,400
Because we have a few lines where we break down exactly how it works,

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,400
and we talk about time, we talk about forward vol,

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,440
we talked a little bit about calendars, but let's turn it into strategy. Yeah.

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,540
Love it. Love it. Love it. All right. So here we go. Here's zero days.

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,180
Here's the 30 day option. Here's the 90 day option.

51
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,020
This option right here might have, let's say a volatility of 50%. Okay.

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,700
And this option right here is going to have, let's say a volatility of 40%.

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,500
I don't know. Okay. Two arbitrary numbers.

54
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,690
Maybe draw out the like lines for them.

55
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,960
So like show like to the 50 and then to the 40 and then do the thing. Yeah.

56
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,140
So this option is going to see,

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,720
this 30 day option is going to see like the volatility like this. Okay.

58
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,780
This option right here is going to see 40 vol, not 50.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,380
So it might see something a little bit smaller over on this side, but together,

60
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,820
okay, 50. And let's say this is 30, 30 vol together.

61
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:33,840
It's going to be 40 volatility. And this 30 right here is the forward vol.

62
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,450
Okay. It's the volatility between the expirations.

63
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,070
And you can't just see that looking at your brokerage or anything like that.

64
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,130
It's sort of behind the scenes, right?

65
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,690
You have to infer it from what you're seeing.

66
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,920
And of course we need to use a little bit of math for that,

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,920
but don't worry guys,

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,780
we have a little special tool that you guys can take advantage of.

69
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,300
This little thing called the terminal. The terminal. Oh, you spoiled it, man.

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,610
Why? Why did you spoil that? It was the closing remarks. Okay.

71
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,230
So what we're going to do now is we're going to go look at the terminal. Okay.

72
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,370
And we're going to talk about how we make money, all that stuff, guys,

73
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,410
but we really need to understand what this volatility is.

74
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,950
Okay. So we go to the terminal. Okay. So let's take a look here.

75
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,560
We see implied volatility 90 in red and in green, we see implied volatility 30.

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,780
Now when I look at implied volatility 90 here, I say, wow, that's pricey. Wow.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,460
That's pricey. But it's not like it's at its highs.

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,100
It's not like unbelievably pricey,

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,100
but look what happens when I look at the forward vol 90 30, right? This is,

80
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,780
this is us finding our edges, right?

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,100
We're looking at the world through a different lens than everyone else.

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,430
Look at this. Here's the forward vol 30 90. You can see it's at extreme highs,

83
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,650
but it's never even been close to this high before. Right.

84
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,390
So these are the kind of, you know,

85
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,350
hidden trades that we can kind of find out there in the wild.

86
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,310
And we're going to do a whole bunch of examples here.

87
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,010
What does it mean that the forward volatility is high?

88
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,970
So what it means is that if we're looking here at the forward 30 90, okay.

89
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,730
What this tells us is, so this is saying 93 vol.

90
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,320
So what that's telling us is once 30 days goes, right? Once we,

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,560
once the 30 day options expire, what will those 90 day options be? Okay.

92
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,020
Once the 30 day options expires, what will those 90 day options implied vol be?

93
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,380
And this is saying that it's going to be 93. Now we might say, well,

94
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,860
I don't think that's the case. Once these 30 day options expire,

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,410
it's these options are actually going to be worth 75. And if that's the case,

96
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,070
well,

97
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,610
this is super expensive and you could sell this forward vol by selling a calendar

98
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,500
spread. So before we get there, Jordan, maybe like a way to think about it is,

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,600
um, imagine we're looking at, uh,

100
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:27,310
the forward vol between the 10 day and 20 day option. Okay. And we see that,

101
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,200
uh, you know, the, the forward vol between them is really high,

102
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,850
but we look at the T the difference between the two.

103
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,430
We look at everything happening around the stock and we see that there's nothing,

104
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,290
there's no real, like, there's no difference between these two. Like, uh,

105
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,930
there's no event in the back.

106
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,430
There's no event a week and a half or two weeks from now,

107
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,550
what is driving all this really high vol, right?

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,640
Unless we come to the conclusion that it's,

109
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,040
it's like people bidding up the two week, right?

110
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,590
It's all the volume on the monthly or whatever we come up with. And well,

111
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,230
now we can,

112
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,810
we can actually see what's being priced into that back month more than that front

113
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,460
month or front week. And we can actually make a trade out of it. Right?

114
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,180
So when it's high like that, what criteria,

115
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,500
before we jump into the trade Jordan,

116
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,480
if let's build a strategy out of trading high forward volatility, what, what,

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,160
what, what helps us convert it from it being just high to being expensive?

118
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,960
Yeah. Yeah. That's really a question. Um, and here would be the answer.

119
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,380
So imagine we're looking at this Volco. Okay.

120
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,160
And we're going to go over a couple of examples, guys,

121
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,000
where you guys are really going to paint the pitch really and paint the picture.

122
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,400
The forward vol here. Okay. Imagine forward vol was 150.

123
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,920
Well, you clearly want to be a seller of that, right?

124
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,160
So what you you're basically saying, right. In 30 days,

125
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,880
what is this vol going to be? And we can look at, let's say the Volco and say,

126
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,380
okay, well, if in 30 days, the 90 day options are going to be one 50. Well,

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,350
that's never going to be that. That was never seen before. Right.

128
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,430
I've never seen something that high before, or the market's never seen.

129
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,800
That's probably too expensive. Right.

130
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,460
An example with one that I was looking at was that, um,

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,000
the vol was actually 12. The forward vol was 12,

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:28,990
but implied vol has never seen below 35. Okay. So let's on the flip side. Okay.

133
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:37,480
On the flip side, what if forward vol was 25? Well, that's extremely low,

134
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,860
right? Considering where, where realized vol is right now.

135
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,020
So you're still thinking, well,

136
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,580
what would make this forward vol cheap versus expensive, right?

137
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Just like implied volatility.

138
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,080
What would make this implied vol cheap versus expensive?

139
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,030
You're just trading a different volatility. Okay. Does that,

140
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,830
did that make sense? Let's do an example. Let's do an example here, guys.

141
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,950
We can also do more examples.

142
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,120
I can start doing them on some of the morning lives as well. Okay. Okay.

143
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,640
I like that. Um, let's do, okay. You know what? Well, let's look at,

144
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,750
take a look at the trade, um, that margin did today. Okay.

145
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,740
So we'll take a look at the trade margin did today. So, um, oh,

146
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,600
they are so bad after hours here. Let's do something like, uh,

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,160
who's got a stock. Who's got a stock.

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,060
They want us to take a look at their forward vols. Who's got it.

149
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,780
It's first come first serve ride. Oh, this better be liquid.

150
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,590
I'm going to lose it. Okay. Perfect.

151
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,440
Okay. Perfect.

152
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,740
So here we go. Oh, is this thing moving after hours?

153
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,010
Oh, it did. Okay. Can we get a stock that, uh, you know what here,

154
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,150
I'll do the analyze, think back feature that way.

155
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,740
Everything is going to work out. Good. I mean, you can't analyze the trade.

156
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,640
If you do that. All right. Just do Neo Rob. Sorry. Okay. Neo, Neo. Yeah,

157
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,420
I guess.

158
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,660
Um, okay. You know what, Rob? Hold on. Okay. Actually, Sean,

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,300
we're actually gonna, we're actually gonna do right here.

160
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,500
We're going to do right here. I think it's a good one to do, but, um,

161
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,780
and then we'll, we'll do Neo afterwards. We'll get,

162
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,660
we'll get two examples in here. So, uh, ride.

163
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:49,470
Let's take a look here. Rob implied vols, uh, was 185%. Okay. For March 19th,

164
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,140
they had earnings. So, you know, 185% vol there. Now let's look at,

165
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,450
let's say the April. Okay. April is 141. Okay. And that's,

166
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:10,390
and that is 31 days out. Okay. So let's do that. 1.85 for the first month.

167
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,760
Okay. Volatility. And what did we say the other one was?

168
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,900
140.

169
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:26,950
Okay. 140. 140, three and 31. Okay. Let's take a look.

170
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,720
Let's see what the output is. The output is 134 volatility.

171
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,960
So what that's telling us is once that expiration is gone. Okay.

172
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,240
Once this is gone. Once March 19th is gone.

173
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,640
This volatility here is going to be 134%.

174
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,460
So after the earnings is gone in three days,

175
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:56,030
what is this April 16 volatility going to be? And the market saying it's 134%.

176
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,050
Now let's go over here. To the terminal. Let's type in ride.

177
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,440
134%. Rob, what were like, what do you think about that?

178
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,640
What do you think about the 30 day options right here? Okay.

179
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,360
Going to 134 after the earnings event, is that cheaper expensive too?

180
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,040
Maybe it's nothing. What do you think about it?

181
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,940
What do you guys think? Cheaper expensive. 134.

182
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,870
Co-hosting cheap. Co-hosting cheap. Cool. That's all the way up here.

183
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,930
I looked for a little bit on the pricey side.

184
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:56,030
Jared. Yeah. What's yours? Pricey. Yeah. It's a little bit pricey, right? Well,

185
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,590
it's not like, uh, actually it does look a little pricey. Right.

186
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,970
And so we might think that that's expensive.

187
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,610
And we'd want to be a seller forward ball, but take a look at this guys. Okay.

188
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:16,740
Imagine that that April contract had an implied volatility of 100 instead of 1.4.

189
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:24,760
It had a volatility of 100. Well, now the forward vol would be 86.

190
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,670
Okay. The forward vol would be 86. Now, when we look at this,

191
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,510
is 86 cheaper expensive?

192
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:41,000
What do you guys think is 86 cheaper expensive? Cheap. It's super cheap.

193
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,860
It's super. It's in fact, it's never been below 95 before.

194
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:52,040
So we could lock that in. Right. We could lock in that 86 of all, uh,

195
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,160
by trading a calendar spread. Okay. We could do that by let's say selling this.

196
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,460
Okay. Selling the March and buying the April. And that's going to lock into 86.

197
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,340
And what we're actually going to find is tomorrow.

198
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,790
So the market's not going to price that 86 of all. Okay.

199
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,450
The market's not going to, well,

200
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,170
you're not going to wake up and see the back at 86. Instead.

201
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,250
What are you going to see happen? What do you guys think?

202
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:30,200
So today we're going to say month one. Is one 81.85. Month two is equal to one.

203
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,820
Is month. Tomorrow is month two going to equal to. 86 to 0.86.

204
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,170
What do you guys think?

205
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,030
Jared's saying no. No. How come Jared? Well, what's your opinion?

206
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,770
How come you don't think it's going to go to 86?

207
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,560
Blessing saying not yet. Okay. Blessing saying not yet.

208
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,110
So we got a little bit of a little bit of batting in the heads here.

209
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,170
What are you guys thinking? What's going through that head?

210
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,890
Words that each day and then fall off after the front month expires.

211
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,990
I feel like, I feel like red posted that one. Was that from red? No,

212
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,670
that was from Jared. Okay. Okay. Say it again.

213
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,300
It will move towards that each day and then fall off after the front month expires.

214
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,930
Okay. So.

215
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,260
What's what's actually going to happen here is after the earnings event,

216
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,400
this is going to drop off. Right.

217
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,570
So M one is going to drop off to maybe let's say a hundred ball. Right.

218
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,110
Earnings events gone.

219
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,010
But what we're actually going to see in month two is it's not going to change.

220
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,050
It's going to stay at 100. Because. Remember if month two went to 86.

221
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,300
Everybody would buy it.

222
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,140
It's been the it's it's 10 points lower than it's ever been.

223
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,420
So month two is never going to see 86. And that's the forward ball.

224
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,770
It's because this is so high. Right. The front is so high.

225
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,150
Relative to the back.

226
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,460
That it's making this illusion that the market thinks that after the event,

227
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,540
it's going to be 86. But it's not right. Imagine for example,

228
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,830
we'll do one more example here. Imagine this. Was two 20.

229
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:42,070
Or let's go even higher. Three 20. Would we ever see volatility of 10%?

230
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,080
Right. Would we ever see a volatility after that expires of 10%? Never.

231
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,200
We would never see it. And that is. It's just a forward ball.

232
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,260
It's the market saying, Hey, I think that given the,

233
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,320
given these two expirations. Board ball is going to be 86.

234
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,620
But we can look at that and say, there's no way. Right. And by,

235
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,420
by buying the back and selling the front. We can capture that spread. Right.

236
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,710
So we'll do Neo where we can actually analyze the trade.

237
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,870
And I think this is going to. Solidify it for everybody.

238
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,800
So let's take a look at Neo.

239
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,490
And we're going to do instead of. Instead of March 19. We're going to do.

240
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,120
April. And may. Yeah, we're going to do it. Let me see if it's.

241
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,810
Okay. You know what? We're sorry, buddy.

242
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,830
We're not going to do Neo because the vols aren't different enough.

243
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:57,880
If the vols are the same, right. If you have, let's say. 0.85. And 0.85. Right.

244
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,300
Well, the forward ball is going to be 0.85.

245
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,200
So we can tell you that's a little bit different. What's that buddy. Game stop.

246
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,440
That's a good one. Game stop.

247
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,800
Okay. That's perfect.

248
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,470
So let's take a look here. Let's do.

249
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,940
Okay. Let's do this.

250
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,300
Okay. We're going to do the forward vols between. April and July. Okay.

251
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,610
So three, three, seven. Let's do this.

252
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,080
Three. We'll say four.

253
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,400
And.

254
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,700
Two four. So three. Four two. Four.

255
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,530
And that's three days. And I believe. Sorry, 31 days. And.

256
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:38,320
Okay. So the forward volatility. Is 195%. So after in 30 days, guys. Okay.

257
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,170
In 30 days. What's the market is saying is. The volatility for July.

258
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,140
Is going to be 190%. Okay. In 30 days.

259
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,800
The volatility for this July contract is going to be a hundred. And. 90%.

260
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,320
If it's larger than 190%. And you're long. These you're going to make money.

261
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,400
And if it's less. And you're in your short fees, you're going to make money.

262
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,370
So let, let us take a look at this trade. So first off,

263
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,350
what do you guys think about that? 190 Vol.

264
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,480
190 Vol. Any opinions?

265
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:32,540
Steve says it seems fair. Steven, man. We have to live a little man. Come on.

266
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,640
Let's live a little. Is it under overpriced? What do you think?

267
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,680
Under or overpriced. Let's take a look. Jimmy. Okay.

268
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
This is a 200 line is right around here. Just above the third quantile.

269
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,370
Okay. Let's see what realize vol is. Realize vol is about.

270
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,970
About three 80 right now. Okay.

271
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,330
What do you guys think? 190 Vol cheaper, expensive.

272
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,520
Here is the historical 90 day implied volatility. Okay.

273
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,100
So one 90 is right around here.

274
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,480
Jared saying cheap. Okay. Perfect. I was hoping you'd say that Jared.

275
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:35,140
So. What do we think? Okay. So what Jared,

276
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,600
so what do you think fair value might be for this? In 30 days,

277
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
what do you think the fair value would be?

278
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,380
What's Jason. He said, go back to think or swim.

279
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,200
To think or swim. Yeah.

280
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,960
Pretend this was three 37 and this is two 40. Yeah.

281
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,860
He wants to go to the chain. He's looking at it.

282
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,050
He wants you to open April. April's open there, Jared, the monthlies.

283
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Or maybe open the ninth for him.

284
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,980
What do you think Jay? One 90.

285
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:56,630
He said. Two 90. Hell yeah, man. All right. All right. So.

286
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,100
Jared saying in 30 days. Or basically. After this expires.

287
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,800
This option right here is going to go from two 15.

288
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,180
To two 90 or feel slowly creep up to that two 90 mark. And so.

289
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,910
To get that forward ball. Okay. It's a relative value play.

290
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,770
So one of two things can happen here. One. Okay.

291
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,150
This needs to go up.

292
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:34,300
Okay. So either it goes from. 2.4. Okay. To three. Then we get our two 90.

293
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,080
So the back needs to go up to 300 today.

294
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:44,010
Or this. This. Needs to drop.

295
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,860
Okay. From three 40 to let's say two 70 or two 20. Or 200, sorry.

296
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,690
Or even one 90.

297
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,810
Okay. So one of two things needs to happen. Either the front needs to drop.

298
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,150
In order to get, you know, what Jared is, is really. You know,

299
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,680
Thinking of or the back needs to get pushed up. Okay.

300
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,980
So one of those two things. Needs to happen. In order for,

301
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,720
for Jared to think that forward ball. Is going to be at two 90. Okay.

302
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,800
So let's head over to the terminal now or the.

303
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,310
The chain and let's put on this calendar spread. Now.

304
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,760
If in fact. Right. So two things we know can happen here.

305
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,300
Either the front needed to drop like 80%. Okay. A little bit wild, but.

306
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,340
We're living a little. Okay. In this case.

307
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,430
That is what that would give us a forward ball of two 90. Or.

308
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:59,090
So we would make a ton of money there. Or the back needs to explode. Okay.

309
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:05,330
I think we said 60%. Okay. So one of two of those things. Needs to happen.

310
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,800
And that is as long as one of those things happen. We're going to make money.

311
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,470
Right. It's we're creating that forward volatility. On the flip side. Okay.

312
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,880
If we're wrong. If in fact. Forward ball is one 10. Okay. Well,

313
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,140
this is going to have to maybe drop by 60 points.

314
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,320
Right. Or maybe the front increases drastically. Right. So let's say.

315
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,120
Let's say another 60 points.

316
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,140
So by training this calendar spread, we can take advantage of mispriced.

317
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,560
Forward volatility.

318
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,580
Okay.

319
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,300
Neil, what do you think? I did a good job explaining this.

320
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
Are you still with us?

321
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,940
I think we might've lost him at one point there. We did.

322
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,320
He's out to go get a bagel cinnamon raisin or a subway. I'm just thinking like,

323
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,950
cause he said, I think the right answer is choice. C. Is that what he said?

324
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,460
Yeah. Oh my gosh. You must be.

325
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,980
You must have a cinnamon raisin bagel in one hand in the subway.

326
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,360
And the other hand right now.

327
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,050
Yeah. I'll post it up for you, Chris. No problem.

328
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,300
Okay. So Jordan, do you want to maybe do a recap? Yeah. So.

329
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,560
I was using some code there, but in reality, you know, Sean,

330
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,130
I never want to leave you guys hanging. So instead what we're going to do.

331
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:49,620
Is we are going to. Oh, we have embedded it in the terminal for you guys.

332
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,330
So you head over to event IV calculator.

333
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,670
And here is your forward volatility calculator. Right here it is.

334
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:06,740
So let's say eyeball. First expiration is. What was it there? Three 40.

335
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:17,430
And eyeball second was. Two 40. I think it was. We'll just go with that.

336
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,600
And this was expiring in April. I have to fix these date things.

337
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,290
Okay. April. And this one was expiring in.

338
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,630
July. I think we said. Oh, it was August. Or was it? No, it was.

339
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,590
I think it was July.

340
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,400
Okay. Okay.

341
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,210
So we run the forward volatility and then we have our volatility of.

342
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,890
Of 200%. Okay. So now we can make that decision of. Is that cheap or expensive?

343
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,410
And. You know, sometimes you can find some unreal deal guys. Like sometimes,

344
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,990
for example, there's just so much. Pressure coming into the front month.

345
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,210
So it's buying pressure coming into the front month. That this becomes,

346
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,660
let's say. I don't know. Three 90. Right. Right. Well,

347
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,460
now we have a volatility. Affordable of one 72. And we can say, okay, well,

348
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,640
that's dirt cheap. Right. We want to pick that up.

349
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,700
Let's make it clear for everyone. Buying the front.

350
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,640
If that was the case where it was three 90 to 40.

351
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,820
Would you be buying the front selling the back or would you be doing the opposite?

352
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,610
If it was three 94. You'd want to be selling the front,

353
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,510
assuming you think that. The forward ball is cheap.

354
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,140
So you think forward ball is cheap. You're buying the back, selling the front.

355
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,520
If you think forward ball is expensive, you're selling the back,

356
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,140
buying the front.

357
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:58,540
Okay. Can we. And for forward vault. 30 90. Right. So that's not in this one,

358
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:03,750
but it's in the new one. That's being released extremely soon. And you can,

359
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,630
you can of course. Graph it as well here. If you guys want. Yeah.

360
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,550
Jared was saying we need to write this into the scanner. Yeah.

361
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:15,190
Sometimes there's some super like. Insane deals guys.

362
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,570
I've seen some insane deals during my time. Where it's like,

363
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,520
The implied ball is just actually happens around earnings events too.

364
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
Sometimes where the implied ball is just in the back.

365
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,500
When you look at the forward volatility. It's just so, so low.

366
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,060
And so when you get the adjustment tomorrow,

367
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,800
What we actually find is that the front moves down too much.

368
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,160
And the back stays up. So let's take a quick look at Tesla.

369
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,720
Cause I think there was a time to buy very cheap, cheap forward ball.

370
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,000
Or sorry, sell, sell expensive ball. So, so this is what the,

371
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,480
this is what everyone else sees. Everyone else sees the IV 90.

372
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,760
They see the IV 30. Okay. But they don't see the forward balls.

373
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,590
And this is where things can get interesting.

374
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,840
So actually it doesn't look like it was too out of line.

375
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,860
But they're actually okay. So down here, for example. Right. So down here.

376
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,310
Jan 15, 2020. So, you know, before everything started happening.

377
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,640
Forward vols got extremely low. Look at that. Basically the 90 day options.

378
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,780
The market was saying in 30 days, the 90 day options are going to be a 40 ball.

379
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:38,360
Can you imagine that sub 40? Okay. I know that. I know. Yeah. Go ahead.

380
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,980
The forward vault to the Vulcan for a reference of higher low. Yeah.

381
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,660
A hundred percent. Right. Or 100%. You know,

382
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,460
and obviously we're all using two years data here, but.

383
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,820
So we can't go back in time to see forever, but there are times guys,

384
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,280
especially in these like not super, super liquid names.

385
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,660
Where a whole bunch of vol, a whole bunch of pressure is going to come in.

386
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,160
Let's say some type of expiration.

387
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,090
Maybe it's the front and it's just going to drive up the price,

388
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,790
but the back is not going to change as much.

389
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,390
And so you can structure these calendar trades to, you know,

390
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,790
to get some real nice returns. Busting out a good question here.

391
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,230
She was asking if we could put this as one of the strategy filters.

392
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,360
Like we call it calendars. Yeah,

393
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,380
I guess we could run something like forward vault percentile.

394
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,820
Yeah, I guess, I guess we could do that blessing.

395
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,680
Just for you.

396
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,460
Yeah.

397
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,400
But I'm actually working on a project right now that is looking at the one-year

398
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,840
two-year forward balls. And that's you know, that's, I think there's so much,

399
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,780
I was talking about it.

400
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,980
I think there's so much money to be made in the longer dated forward balls.

401
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,420
Any other questions there? Any, any quick ones?

402
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,400
You guys want me to look at the forward balls and then we'll call,

403
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,280
we'll wrap it up.

404
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:15,730
Right.

405
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,720
Okay. So forward vols are dropping. They're at one 80, one 83 for the 30,

406
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,220
the 90. Okay. Let's take a look. Let's take a super quick look here.

407
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,770
Okay. Right. Which ones were you wanting? Which,

408
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,500
which four balls you want to trade? Okay. So you can see here. Okay. Wow. Good.

409
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,670
This is getting really pricey. Right. So check this out.

410
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,970
You're going to like this one. Who asked it? All right. Right.

411
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,730
Jared. Jared. Okay. Jared. You're gonna like this one. Okay.

412
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,110
So this is where four balls probably going to be super expensive.

413
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:10,040
So you can see here, Jared. That. This option for the April. Is one 65 ball.

414
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:19,600
And for the June. Is one 71. Okay. So before I actually go and price it.

415
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,020
I have a question for you guys. Is forward vol going to be higher.

416
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,630
Or lower than one 71. Let me just, let me just close everything else here.

417
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,130
Is forward vol going to be higher or lower than 71. One 71.

418
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,830
Guys are saying higher. Guys are saying higher. That's it. PA gang, gang, gang.

419
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:52,310
And why is that? Because this option. Is going to see 165 all. For 30 days.

420
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:57,800
But then it's probably going to see one 80 ball. For the next 60, one 85.

421
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,940
And the next 60. Which is driving up. That June volatility.

422
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,920
So let's go and price it out in the terminal.

423
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:15,320
Option calculator. First expo is what do we say? One 65. And second was one 80.

424
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:25,250
Or one 75. Yeah, it was a little lower. One 75. Four 16. And. It was.

425
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,570
It was June. No, July.

426
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,300
It was June.

427
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,520
All right. So there you go. Right. The forward volatility is going to be 180%.

428
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,140
For this option. And if we look at, if we look at the chain here.

429
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,750
Let's take a look.

430
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,940
If we look at the vol insights. Or even look at realizable.

431
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,180
Like one 80 is super bid. Right. One 80 is all the way up.

432
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,140
It's literally the highest for the 90 days. Right.

433
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,640
We're going to be at the third quantile. Sorry.

434
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,400
We're going to be the third quantile for the 90 days. When that expires. And.

435
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,140
You know, given that realizable. Well, realize ball has been moving Jared.

436
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,580
Right. It's been moving quite a bit. But let's say for example.

437
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,370
This was at like, you know, we're not going to find inefficiencies everywhere.

438
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,290
It's going to be. The one-offs. Not the one-offs, but you got to look for them.

439
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,430
If let's say realize volger. Never got above one 70. Never got above one 70.

440
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,590
While selling eyeball. I saw a forward vol at one 80.

441
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,310
That's like extremely pricey. Right. And we could,

442
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,530
we could kind of find that because. There was contango in the term structure.

443
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,850
Even though. Falls were so high. Right.

444
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,390
And that's where forward vol is really going to look pricey.

445
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,420
So there you go. That's a. That's forward vol.

446
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,320
That's how you take advantage of it. You just trade the calendar spreads.

447
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,280
After this, we'll chat about how we can throw it into the strategy thing.

448
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,960
I think it'd be good to have something for calendars. Yeah. Good return on.

449
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,770
Great return on capital. Great return on debits. They're great.

450
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,720
Very cool. And maybe we'll do a part two of this.

451
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,060
I have a few questions that I'm going to build out that I think just from what you've

452
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,080
done here that I think we can do a part two. That next week.

453
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,120
Cool. Okay. I'm going to stop the recording.
