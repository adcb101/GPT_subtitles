1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,240
All right, where we are recording. Thank you, Eric So,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,140
yeah that I've known about these for quite a long time I've never made much use

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,610
out of them That that also says guys Just because I don't make use of them doesn't

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,870
mean they're not useful, right?

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,690
There's things that I use that other people might think is useless For example implied

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,810
volatility right a lot of people think implied volatility is useless yet.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,500
It's the way that I make my living so But I think I do have a pretty good grasp

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,580
on on how they on how they operate what they are And so I really want to break that

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,930
down for you guys All right, so we're going to jump right into it.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:07,960
So I'm gonna share my screen and here we go So this is this interview not this interview.

11
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,460
This live is gonna be done in our however No coding knowledge is needed.

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,370
And if you want me to explain something, please slow me right down Okay,

13
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,710
please slow me right down guys.

14
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:25,810
Well,

15
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:41,580
I seem to get the chat going here Okay,

16
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,520
so I do have the chat live Please stop me along the way by the end of this guys

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,500
I want all of you to be well aware of what Vanna is what charm is and I honestly

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,940
think you guys are gonna be way ahead of the crowd in terms of this new buzzword

19
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,360
Okay, I'm monitoring the chat. So please ask any questions along the way.

20
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,520
Can everyone see my screen?

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:09,540
Okay Let me know if you guys can see my screen Awesome blessing.

22
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,080
How's everything?

23
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,270
Very cool. Very cool. Okay.

24
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,530
So as this as this thing is loading right here I just want to give a quick primer.

25
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,050
So right now we're seeing a big buzzword out there.

26
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,800
It's called Vanna Vanna and charm And what we're seeing on Twitter is a lot of people

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,140
talking about Vanna a lot of people talking about charm Seeing how you know,

28
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,800
they can apparently make money You know basically seeing the Vanna flows and when

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,500
they say Vanna flows what their meaning is Money coming into the market that is

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,580
creating. Let's say Certain buying and selling pressure. Okay,

31
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,660
or maybe I take that back. Actually,

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,660
it's not money coming into the market It's how the options are reacting That's causing

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,300
buying and selling pressure and that is a huge buzzword right now Everyone's talking

34
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,560
about it and Personally,

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,740
okay personally as you guys are gonna find out I don't think it is as important

36
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:31,410
as As these traders are claiming but you know a lot of the time guys,

37
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,260
oh actually and I want to say something else as well a Lot of people who are coming

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,000
on to Twitter and and and following these guys and you know talking these guys up

39
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,410
They actually don't understand what they're talking about right and and this is

40
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,590
actually coming from people messaging us saying hey,

41
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,770
listen I follow these guys. These guys are very cool.

42
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,710
I don't understand what they're talking about, right?

43
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:03,510
And I'm sure you guys can resonate with that as well Gemco song Chris video,

44
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,350
right?

45
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,810
These guys are talking about Vanna flows charm flows It's hard to keep up but because

46
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,810
of these fancy words,

47
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,330
we kind of get sucked in Maybe they know something more than us and we're just not

48
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,550
at their level yet And so for this live we want to really break that down.

49
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,770
All right, so First thing is Vanna Okay,

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,850
Vanna is and I'm gonna break this all down and if you guys don't understand this

51
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,150
We are going to break it down we're gonna go to the base layer We're gonna basically

52
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,970
take in this life You know this like foreign thing that no one can understand and

53
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,670
we're gonna bring it down to reality Okay,

54
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:48,110
so every single person on this life can understand including you Neil so Vanna is

55
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,910
the partial derivative of Delta with respect to volatility now I don't I don't you

56
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,010
know,

57
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,750
I don't need you guys to understand this This is how someone might explain it to

58
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:03,100
you Vanna is the partial derivative of Delta with respect to vol. Okay,

59
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,210
so Someone might say someone sees the formula like this. Okay,

60
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,370
so when someone might see the formula Okay, we're go line by line.

61
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:19,310
They might see Delta divided by vol divided by Vega or Sorry divided by vol IV and

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,160
they might see this fancy word there.

63
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,630
They might see this fancy letter So if I go on Google,

64
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,850
for example This might be a little bit of a longer guys a longer live probably an

65
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,610
hour Just because I really want you guys to understand this.

66
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,490
Let's see if they have it.

67
00:05:46,170 --> 00:06:00,910
Okay, they don't have it here. Let's see Okay, here it is. Okay,

68
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:09,130
so This is gamma. Here it is. Perfect. So we might see it like this.

69
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,550
Okay The change in Delta,

70
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,730
so sorry you guys might see like this Delta divided by Vega Okay,

71
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,390
this is how some of us might see it Delta Divided by Vega or divided by implied

72
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,290
volatility But this is actually not what it is. Okay,

73
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:39,010
it is the partial derivative meaning the change in Delta with respect to the change

74
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,660
in implied volatility okay,

75
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:50,810
so what that means is if Volatility changes How does our Delta change? Okay,

76
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,330
if volatility changes, how does my Delta change? Okay,

77
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:02,950
it's not Delta divided by implied volatility or divide by Vega It's if the denominator

78
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:08,370
okay in this case implied volatility were to change How is my Delta going to change?

79
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,170
Okay,

80
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,950
does everyone understand that and Do please don't be afraid to say no Okay,

81
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,810
because we are gonna go step-by-step if I can't get everyone on this live to understanding

82
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,470
what Vanna flows are what charm flows are We're not gonna get it.

83
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:31,830
Thank you blessing So blessing and everyone else who also probably has the same

84
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,510
question because I know it's not just blessing Delta is the change in the option

85
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,020
price Okay with the change in the stock price.

86
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:53,610
So if the stock goes up a dollar Well, how much is my option gonna go up? Well,

87
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,890
if it's not the money Let's say has a Delta of 50.

88
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:07,880
It's gonna go up 50 cents a call option now what this is saying is if Volatility

89
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,680
was to change. Okay, if volatility was to change How would my Delta change?

90
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,090
Okay, if my let's say I have a Delta.

91
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:25,190
Let's say I buy out of the money call option it's trading at 30 deltas and implied

92
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,550
volatility changed Well, what would my Delta be if implied volatility changed?

93
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,860
So that is what Vanna is and we're actually gonna go in detail We're actually gonna

94
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,340
do examples of it to see and graph it out.

95
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,760
It's gonna be a very cool live guys I promise you. Okay,

96
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,080
we're all gonna be smarter after this. I hope I really hope so.

97
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,670
So that is what Vanna is Now we have charm. Okay, and Actually Steve,

98
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,990
I hope you're really paying attention here because I'm gonna be asking you some

99
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,170
tough questions Okay,

100
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:12,500
so I hope you're paying very good attention So charm is the partial derivative of

101
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,870
Delta with respect to time. Okay.

102
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,050
So what that means is the change in time So if we move forward in time because we

103
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,570
can't move back in time Unfortunately, if we move forward in time,

104
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,530
how is my Delta gonna change?

105
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,120
Call you're saying there's three definitions of Vanna. Oh, no,

106
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,620
I for that for those formulas.

107
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,820
They were just deriving it They were just deriving it.

108
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,300
It wasn't saying what what they exactly were So charm is the partial derivative

109
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,260
of Delta with respect to time so if time moves forward,

110
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,340
how does my Delta change? Okay,

111
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,720
and Delta is our sensitivity to the stock price.

112
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,850
A lot of guys are claiming to make money on this personally Personally,

113
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,000
I believe this is a fundraising Technique. Okay.

114
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,130
This is a fundraising technique If people don't understand me,

115
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,950
but they didn't think I'm making money.

116
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,200
They're likely to give me money Right if everyone thinks I'm making money and like

117
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,650
your friend tells you that hey Jordan's making money and I talk like I'm making

118
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:18,910
Money,

119
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,490
it's it's likely you're gonna give me money even though you don't understand me

120
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,730
I honestly think this is what this is what the gurus are doing But we're you guys

121
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,190
are gonna come to your own conclusions about this.

122
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,400
I don't want to I Don't want to influence you Okay.

123
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,880
Now these are the two that are popular Vanna and charm. Okay.

124
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,060
These are second-order derivatives Right.

125
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,330
It's the change it so Delta is the derivative The change in Delta is the second

126
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:51,330
derivative just like gamma right gamma is the change in Delta With respect so who's

127
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,470
got this one? What is what is gamma if we were gonna put it in these terms?

128
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,590
Okay in these You know in these in these terms right here. What is gamma?

129
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,180
Neil saying change in Delta with respect to Vega No, no, that's not what it is.

130
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,730
You know the percent change of Delta. No. Thank you.

131
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,930
Thanks chigs It's the change in Delta with respect to price Right,

132
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,030
so we have for example in this case Right,

133
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,470
we have Delta with respect to implied volatility now I just want to make it clear

134
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,190
guys for this live this live is not an alpha live.

135
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,650
Okay this live I'm not teaching you guys how to make alpha in this live We're explaining

136
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,630
what the hype stuff is all about but in explaining it I honestly think a lot of

137
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,690
you are gonna start to by the time we get to the end of this guys I think a lot

138
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,310
of you are going to actually I think there's gonna be some like You know some some

139
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,340
moments here So yeah,

140
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,860
so Delta is the change in price with respect to the change I'm sorry the change

141
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,460
in Delta with respect to the change in price.

142
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,700
That's what gamma is So gamma is a second-order derivative,

143
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,200
but it's an important one. Okay.

144
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,020
Now there's other derivatives There's other second and third order of this for example

145
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,280
Voma. Okay,

146
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,760
Voma is the network I'm not gonna talk about these but just so you got the night

147
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,560
guys know that they're out There is the change of Vega the change implied volatility.

148
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,120
Okay, then we have speed Okay,

149
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,920
which is the change in gamma for the change in Delta Okay So a way out of the money

150
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,490
option has very little gamma and very little Delta at inception And but it has a

151
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,990
ton of speed Right as the stock drops the gamma is gonna increase increasing the

152
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,840
Delta right and that's why you get those huge ramp ups Okay, you have color.

153
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,520
Okay,

154
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,480
and that's gonna be the changing gamma with respect to the change in time Okay,

155
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,350
then there's Zoma elasticity, you know, there's so many of these okay,

156
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,800
there's so many of these I've never used them personally.

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,980
All right. So let's have this guys. Let's have start having some fun. Okay,

158
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,480
I spent some time on this Let's get some let's have some fun going Okay,

159
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,870
let's make sure I didn't miss anything Neal saying can you give an example of Voma?

160
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,690
sure,

161
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:32,340
Neil An out-of-the-money option has very little Vega But as implied volatility increases

162
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,760
the Vega increases So this is what we talked about with those strangles versus the

163
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,530
straddles Remember when I told you to take a look at that, right?

164
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:46,350
You priced it out as the implied volatility increases the Vega increases So now

165
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,340
for every point of implied increasing you're increasing exponentially Okay,

166
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,740
so it's the increase it change involved in Vega for the change in volatility,

167
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,560
you know I'm actually I'm actually thinking about this or library.

168
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,430
I can't believe we're actually having this conversation like These people online

169
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,950
I've gotten in my opinion way too far. They've gone way too far. Okay,

170
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,610
so Greeks So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna look at an option with one

171
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,290
month to expiration Okay, the stock is trading at a hundred.

172
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,590
The strike is a hundred and ten.

173
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,150
The volatility is 30 Okay interest rate zero dividend zero and one month to expiration

174
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,960
Okay Does everyone understand that an option that's trading at the stock trading

175
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,340
at a hundred?

176
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:39,810
We're buying a 110 call with a 30% implied vol and 20 days to expiration Okay,

177
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:54,810
20 business days one month one month So here you

178
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,360
guys can see it right down here, right? You know what?

179
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:07,170
I'm actually gonna change my view here so we can all be on the same page Do you

180
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,730
guys see view pains pain layout? Here we go.

181
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:27,910
All right.

182
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,690
So here we go guys So let's look at a that that call option here Well that call

183
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,050
option is trading for 57 cents and the Delta is 13.88. What does that mean?

184
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,790
Okay, we're gonna focus on the on this Delta number right now. Okay.

185
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,430
What does this mean?

186
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,410
The Delta is 13.88 and guys if you stay to the end of this We're actually gonna

187
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,970
be going over a market maker example how he manages his book So I really hope you

00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,030
try to you know,

191
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,960
which we'll try to figure it out Can someone explain to me what does this mean Delta

192
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:13,920
point thirteen eight eight Red I'm not gonna be talking about how you can infer

193
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,280
Vanna and charm in the PA terminal personally because I don't think it's useful

194
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,540
but we're gonna get we are gonna get to the end of that red and you can Come up

195
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,380
with your own decision and let me know me like Jordan I think it is useful and I

196
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,940
want I want this in the terminal and I will definitely work on it.

197
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:37,070
Okay Guys I can definitely add this stuff into the terminal. Okay,

198
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,060
I'm so you guys really want this in the terminal Let's let's let's finish this live

199
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,460
and then we're gonna then we'll talk. Okay.

200
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:54,620
All right Delta point thirteen eight eight. What is this inferring?

201
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,110
What is this inferring Delta of point thirteen eighty-eight?

202
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,680
I gotta make sure we're all in the same track here. Oh Man,

203
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,520
you guys fell asleep.

204
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,730
Oh I guess I'm falling asleep. So I thought you guys were pointing to red.

205
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,570
Okay,

206
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:23,510
perfect for every dollar the stock moves The option it will increase by third We'll

207
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,790
have a variance of 13 cents, right?

208
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,630
If the stock goes up a dollar this is gonna make 13 cents the stock goes down dollars

209
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,480
gonna lose 13 cents Now we're talking charm here. Okay,

210
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,500
we're talking charm So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take that same option

211
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:47,150
same spot price spot price means the stock price But instead of 20 days We're gonna

212
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,750
do 19 days. So 19 business days.

213
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:57,380
So we are going to move one ahead one step We're gonna move ahead one step Steve

214
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,880
you still with me Steve? How's it? How's the live going Steve so far?

215
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:12,200
So we're gonna move ahead one step in time Okay. Now, what do we notice here?

216
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,030
What do we notice here? Well the option decreased But our Delta decreased.

217
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay, our Delta decreased by point six Okay,

218
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,180
it went from thirteen point eight eight to thirteen point two two. Okay,

219
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,840
so our Delta Decreased Okay,

220
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,900
as we move forward in time our Delta decreases Okay to show you guys this I'm gonna

221
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:45,710
actually move forward five days Let's take a look. Now. Our Delta is now ten.

222
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,430
Okay,

223
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:54,350
so for every dollar increase in the stock We are only gonna make ten cents as time

224
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:03,240
is going by our Delta is Decreasing Okay, as we're moving forward in time,

225
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,760
our Delta is decreasing that is for charm for an out-of-the-money call option in

226
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,420
Chopper charm. Okay.

227
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,340
It's the rate of change of Delta with respect to time How is my Delta changing as

228
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,180
time moves forward?

229
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,490
Okay, and so for an out-of-the-money option,

230
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,150
let me ask you guys this quick trick question.

231
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,830
What about for an in-the-money option?

232
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,520
Stephen in the money option as time moves forward. What happens to Delta?

233
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,330
Thank you, Stephen It increases right it gonna approach one in the money.

234
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,620
It's gonna approach one. All right,

235
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,200
so that is charm Does everyone understand charm?

236
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,780
We're actually gonna graph all this out in a second. But so far do we get it?

237
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,880
Thank blessing good job with the with the with the increase Bless blessing saying

238
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,960
yeah, if blessing saying yeah,

239
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:06,070
we're good to go because everyone else Is for some reason afraid to ask He's afraid

240
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,950
to ask questions along the way now.

241
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,740
We're gonna go into Vama of Vama Vanna But I call it banana. All right,

242
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:23,790
so we're gonna do the same thing option $100 strike 110 volatility 30 days expiration

243
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:32,340
21 month. Okay, same option. Okay, and what do we see? 13.88 exact same option.

244
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,140
Let me erase this.

245
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:43,330
Oops Let me erase this so we're back we're back to we're back to the same page How

246
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,950
are you guys finding this live so far? Are we okay?

247
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,690
We are we is everyone doing? All right We're having a good everyone smiling.

248
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,140
Everyone's everyone's intrigued Perfect Trent as long as perfect dude blessing.

249
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,720
Is it good so far blessing? Let me know Okay, so Steve this was the question.

250
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:04,850
I wanted to ask you Marcos good stuff, buddy Steve this was the question.

251
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,790
I wanted to ask you. Okay,

252
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:14,200
this is putting Steve's big brain to the test If we drop vol so in this case now,

253
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,800
we're taking the same option right Delta 13.88 and remember Del Vanna is the change

254
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:28,520
in Delta with respect to the change in implied volatility We're gonna drop volatility

255
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
by one point, okay,

256
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,560
we're gonna drop volatility by one point out of the money call option What's gonna

257
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,260
happen to Delta Steve and why?

258
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,840
What is gonna happen to Delta and why and anyone can answer really? You know,

259
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,700
I I purposely when I wrote this one down, what do you think will happen here?

260
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:58,630
It was I was trying to I wanted to give Steve a little test Trent saying decrease

261
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,240
Okay Okay,

262
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:15,280
we're gonna drop implied volatility By one point what's gonna happen Steve?

263
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,500
Do you disagree or agree with Trent?

264
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,440
And I know you're using an option calculator right now.

265
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:33,710
I'm very upset about that Wow Steve man.

266
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,900
I will happen Okay,

267
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,820
yeah what's gonna happen to Delta blessing what's gonna happen to Delta when we

268
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,860
drop vols Okay, so by now Steven is definitely using an option calculator.

269
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,620
So chigs Trent you guys are 100% correct okay,

270
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:59,460
and There's actually Oh Neil see. Oh, wow. Steve's gone.

271
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,500
I guess he had I Guess it's a little boring for him. That's okay.

272
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,200
That's okay guys.

273
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,670
We're gonna keep it going here It's gonna decrease and it's not just gonna decrease

274
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,490
because the the chance of the big move decreases which it does, right?

275
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,490
but the reason I want I was hoping you guys someone would say is volatility is Is

276
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:26,750
synthetic time, right? So dropping volatility is like decreasing time Right,

277
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,470
and so you're 100% correct if we drop volatility, right?

278
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,660
You can see in that here now Delta goes from point one three eight eight to point

279
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,820
one three zero okay,

280
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,080
and if we drop vault by five points our Delta goes from point one three eight eight

281
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,760
to Nine deltas thirteen deltas to nine deltas.

282
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,000
So now we're now this is where it's really gonna get fun and really gonna get interesting

283
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,400
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a sequence of stock prices okay,

284
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,720
stocks gonna trade at a hundred and we're gonna create a sequence from sixty to

285
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,990
hundred and forty dollars and We are going to basically figure out what the Delta

286
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:22,290
is For each of these call options and we're gonna plot them and here is what our

287
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:41,560
Delta looks like You guys are not unfamiliar with this Okay Hundred

288
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,780
Okay, sorry guys,

289
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,200
okay my apologies if it's trading it if the stocks I thought this was strike price

290
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,400
It's spot price the stock trading at a hundred forty The Delta is gonna be one right

291
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,220
because we're buying a hundred dollar call option Right if the stock string at a

292
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,940
hundred you can see right here. We have a hundred as the strike price Right,

293
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,960
so imagine if the stock was trading at sixty dollars the Delta would be zero,

294
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,680
right you guys Stock trading at sixty Delta.

295
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,700
I mean the strike price is a hundred.

296
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,260
So the stocks I move $40 volatility of 30 Right.

297
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,940
The Delta is gonna be zero Now if the stock's trading at a hundred forty for a call

298
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,180
option, the Delta is gonna be one Right,

299
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,040
it's gonna be so far in the money that it's gonna be basically trading at one Red

300
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,120
saying can you just elaborate volatility synthetic time?

301
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,220
We did a live on it red, but you know,

302
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,020
we talk about it If you increase volatility,

303
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,400
it would be the same thing as if you increase time if you decrease volatility It's

304
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,820
the same thing as if you decreased the time.

305
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:58,800
Okay I think about this red you have a 30-day option and you increase volatility

306
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,620
Right you jack up volatility Well,

307
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,880
imagine nothing else to imagine it that actually didn't happen, right?

308
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,160
It would be the same thing as let's say if you if you bought or sold a 60-day straddle

309
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,480
All right. So as you increased volatility,

310
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,800
it's similar to increasing time and you can see that by doing we did a whole live

311
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,060
on it.

312
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:24,120
It was basically where we did a Tree diagram and we explained like how when you

313
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,480
increase time Right your your width gets bigger of the tree when you increase volatility

314
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:41,060
your width gets bigger of the tree I'll Sean if you can send you over that one It's

315
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:48,960
a Vega is not like theta Okay, but implied volatility is like time Okay.

316
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,040
So here we go guys. Here's our Delta everyone understand this Delta curve.

317
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,980
Does that blessing? What do you think?

318
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,380
I'm blessing I'm holding you Accountable for the whole group because you are the

319
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,640
only brave one to to let me know What's up,

320
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,380
we're okay perfect So this is the Delta curve.

321
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,300
This is a Delta of an option Okay,

322
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,400
an option at 100 is going to have 50 Delta and at the money options gonna have 50

323
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,000
Delta Right at the money option 50 Delta in the money option 100 Delta out of the

324
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,240
money option 0 Delta now What we're gonna do is we're actually gonna graph Tomorrow.

325
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,820
Okay, we're looking at charm Okay, what does the Delta look like?

326
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,880
Tomorrow and this is what it looks like.

327
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,920
This is what it looks like. Take a look guys. Here's the difference ready Okay.

328
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,080
Now Sean's computers a little slow.

329
00:27:51,140 --> 00:28:00,640
So it gets a little black so what I'm going to do is What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

330
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,580
plot both of them side by side.

331
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:18,770
I'm gonna plot both of them side by side And here they are Oops, oops. Oops.

332
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,050
Oops. Oh, sorry. Sorry guys. We're looking at Vanna. My apologies.

333
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,520
We're looking at Vanna guys. My apologies. My apologies Okay,

334
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,320
we're gonna actually do Instead of 25 vol we're gonna do 29 vol.

335
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,720
So let's run that again So we're looking at the change of Delta with respect to

336
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,110
the change of volatility So I did one vol point change.

337
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,570
So if implied volatility went from 30 to 29 Okay,

338
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,750
this is how the this is the difference between the Delta. So red okay,

339
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,850
red is tomorrow's implied volatility and Blue is oh,

340
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:04,460
sorry blue is tomorrow's implied Blue is 29 vol red is 30 vol Blue is 29 vol Red

341
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,800
is 30 vol. Okay, and just so you guys can see it clearer.

342
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:24,820
I'm going to drop the vols to 20 Here we go blue is

343
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,020
20 vol red is 30 vol.

344
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,620
Okay, do we understand that right?

345
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:43,490
Let's take a look here guys a 110 call okay 110 call if Volatility is very low if

346
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,900
volatility is zero Right, then we're gonna have a Delta of one Right,

347
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,060
we're in the money with no vol it and zero vol basically means who's got it.

348
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,190
What's another synonym to zero vol? We just talked about it.

349
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,300
What's a synonym to zero vol?

350
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,340
No Thank you. Chigs. Thank you.

351
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,500
Thank you for paying attention chase zero vol would be equal to zero time Okay,

352
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,380
zero vol equals zero time So 110, okay,

353
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,740
so you can see here right if vol is less Right.

354
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,980
That's the 20 is is is a I don't know why I called it tomorrow.

355
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,500
My apologies guys This is 20 vol and this is 30 vol right if the vol is less then

356
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,920
we're gonna be you know a lot closer to one Delta So you can see how here's two

357
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,690
graphs guys with two different vol implied volatilities one day Okay is the blue

358
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:52,650
the next is what implied vols drop this is the Vanna this is the Vanna and To make

359
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,670
it clear to make it clear to everyone.

360
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,050
We are going to graph The Vanna and how do we graph the Vanna? Well,

361
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:07,620
we're gonna simply take the difference between the two. So this is Vanna Okay,

362
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:19,100
this is Vanna and we're going to talk about what this is as volatility increases

363
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,860
Delta Decreases. Okay.

364
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:36,850
It's going to decrease when we are Sorry guys when the Delta when the Vanna Decreases.

365
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,300
Okay when the Vanna decreases if the option is out of the money,

366
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,790
the Delta is gonna decrease The option is out of the money and volatility decreases.

367
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,570
The option is going to Decrease Delta. We just talked about it,

368
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,050
right and let me know if we if we need if we need some help here Margin,

369
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:06,620
welcome. Welcome to the chat. Mr. Banana one okay, if The volatility decreases,

370
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,580
right?

371
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,440
Well are out of the money option is gonna lose Delta but are in the money option

372
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,550
is going to increase Delta Here's spot price right?

373
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,650
Here's the $100 spot price Margin,

374
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,670
I highly recommend You know later tonight whenever you get time away from the girlfriend

375
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,010
you You take a look at the live from the beginning just because you know It's gonna

376
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:33,310
be hard to catch you up right right from here The out of the money option is gonna

377
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:38,960
decrease in Delta the in the money option is gonna increase in Delta So blessing

378
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,030
seeing we got a little bit lost So blessing let's go back here. Okay,

379
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,670
let's go back here.

380
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:55,280
Let's go back to Vanna here is a call option Delta 1388 Okay,

381
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:02,620
Delta 1388 for this call option we are going to Well, I was charm. Sorry,

382
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,460
we are going to decrease volatility blessing.

383
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:25,310
So let's decrease volatility here The out of the money call option lost Delta Okay

384
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:31,400
lost Delta now if it was in the money and I think you actually mentioned it because

385
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,780
volatility is decreasing It's going the Delta is gonna increase All right,

386
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,100
let me ask you this question blessing you got a hundred dollar call option,

387
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,190
okay, and the stocks trading at 110 stocks trading at 110.

388
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:51,620
You got a hundred dollar call option at Expiration. What is the Delta?

389
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,960
What is the Delta of that call option at expiration?

390
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,670
110 stock Hundred dollar call option at expiration perfect one.

391
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,430
What about a year from now? What's that call option a year from now?

392
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:12,210
Don't give me the exact number What do you think a year in time if that call option

393
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,730
was a year in time? What do you think?

394
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,840
So it wouldn't be a year and it wouldn't be one Right,

395
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,080
it would be something like maybe yeah,

396
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:30,820
like maybe probably probably actually less maybe 0.6 0.7 Right because it still

397
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,580
has time to be out of the money Okay,

398
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,870
so it's not gonna be trading out one but as time goes forward or as volatility drops

399
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,990
right volatility equals synthetic time as Volatility drops we're gonna start to

400
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:48,460
see this thing go in the money and that's gonna become a Delta of one So when we

401
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,150
look at Vanna Okay,

402
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,830
and I know guys it like it's a little bit a little bit technical right now We're

403
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,870
gonna actually into a practical experience at the very end as a market maker we're

404
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,230
gonna act as a market maker at the end of this at the end of this live and in the

405
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:07,350
money option as Time goes forward is gonna come closer and closer to one Now to

406
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,850
the money option as time goes forward or volatility drops.

407
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:17,370
It's gonna go closer and closer to zero Now we're gonna do the same thing for charm

408
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,610
Okay, we're gonna do the exact same thing. We have a 20 to 20 day option Okay,

409
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,810
we're gonna 19 day option 20 day 19 day and we're gonna take the difference in Delta

410
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,110
And I have a trick question for you guys.

411
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,870
I have a very trick question for you guys What is charm gonna look like?

412
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:46,050
So here's what Vega Vanna looks like What is charm gonna look like I think I think

413
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,780
I have to put this one on chigs chigs But seem to be getting the answer right chase.

414
00:35:50,880 --> 00:36:00,520
What is charm gonna look like? Here's Vanna Perfect red the same. Oh,

415
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,300
you guys are awesome. Why are they the same?

416
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,540
Why do I can they why are they the same?

417
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,260
Why are they the same?

418
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:23,040
Perfect chigs Vol is synthetic time Perfect. So let's graph it So, sorry,

419
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,600
so first here is the Delta with change in one day time Okay,

420
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:32,740
here's the Delta with one day chop time tomorrow versus today Okay,

421
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:45,960
and if you guys want to see five days Change Okay looks very similar to when we

422
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,280
change volatility and when we graph it voila Exactly the same.

423
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,170
So any questions about that because now we're gonna go into a real-world example

424
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,090
of where you know These guys are coming from these Vanna guys these Vanna flows

425
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:08,530
these charm flows Coasting I'm having trouble with the two curves.

426
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,830
Yep These these ones call or or these ones.

427
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:23,330
So let's call this one and let's call this to Co he said the second then the first

428
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:30,510
Confusing me one or two one. Okay,

429
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,350
Coa Let's take a look at a out of the money call option out of the money call option

430
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,050
It has 30 days to expiration Okay Give me a Delta number.

431
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:55,830
Give me any Delta number out of the money call option 30 days to expiration What

432
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:04,240
Delta could have? 80 80 Okay, 20. Okay,

433
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:12,440
perfect at expiration Coa What Delta could it have out of the money call option

434
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,860
expiration out of the money call option?

435
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,430
So the option goes from 20 deltas to zero.

436
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,970
So what can we say about about the call option in respect to time?

437
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,560
It decreases every day it decreases Everything else else held equal.

438
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,800
What about in the money call? So that's this showing here, right?

439
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,220
So this is the zero line,

440
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:48,130
right and this is saying that As time goes forward in this case one step one time

441
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,790
step. Okay, this call option Lost about three cents. Okay,

442
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:59,610
the y-axis is the change in the Delta So this call option lost about point zero

443
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:09,470
three Delta for one at the bottom here for one time step forward Okay,

444
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,950
and then the in the money option is gonna be the opposite right one time step forward

445
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:19,140
it's gonna increase in Delta So I'm seeing that you said here got it this part.

446
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:32,440
So I'm assuming we're good Okay Okay, continue explaining. Okay,

447
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,460
so then in the money in the money option one day forward Right.

448
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,590
This option is going to increase its Delta by five point zero four Right because

449
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:48,760
and let's say in the money option today Cohen 30 days out is 80 But expiration it's

450
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:57,880
100 so we can say that as Delta as time goes forward or volatility drops Delta increases

451
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,940
in the money.

452
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:07,920
So in the money Delta increases out of the money Delta decreases Yeah spots trading

453
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,380
at a hundred.

454
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,500
All right So now we're gonna have a really fun example and this is where the practicality

455
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,020
comes in, right?

456
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,220
So so in the way I think about it guys is this is how a lot of people show you this

457
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:28,880
stuff These Vanna these charms But no one has anyone ever has anyone told you the

458
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,020
practicalities of Vanna?

459
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,480
Has anyone ever told you what happens to market makers when time changes?

460
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,060
What happens to market makers when vol changes?

461
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,460
Has anyone ever talked about it?

462
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,830
I haven't seen it I haven't seen it on Twitter and and I'm gonna show you guys why

463
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,990
that is. Okay,

464
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:53,520
I'm gonna show you guys What what the reason for that is let's say we've got a market

465
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,620
maker. We're gonna late. We're gonna label him Eminem Okay,

466
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,700
and he is going to sell a 110 call option stocks trading at a hundred stock is trading

467
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,040
at 100 So you are gonna go buy a GME call option stock trading at 100 and you're

468
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,080
gonna buy the 110 GME call option Well, and this is 30 vol. Okay.

469
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:28,040
Well our Delta Okay for the market maker is gonna be 13 deltas, but he's short.

470
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,620
He's short this call option. So he's short 13 deltas Okay,

471
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,360
he's short 13 deltas, but this market maker doesn't sell one.

472
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,060
Okay this market maker instead.

473
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,240
He sells 10,000 of these He sells 10,000 of these option contracts So we're gonna

474
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,940
have a market maker gonna multiply it by a hundred right because Delta is you know

475
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:56,800
times 100 and then we're gonna Multiply it by 10,000 because he sold 10,000 of these

476
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:05,910
contracts So let's look at this market makers book.

477
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,520
Let's take a look at this market makers book.

478
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,300
He's short a hundred and thirty-eight thousand shares He's short one hundred thirty

479
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,740
-eight thousand eight hundred fifty seven shares of this of this of this stock.

480
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,940
So what's he gonna do?

481
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,800
Now he's actually not gonna do this but for Twitter purposes.

482
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,860
What what is this market maker gonna do?

483
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,900
Sure, but I can send it over to you. No problem for Twitter purposes.

484
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,720
What is this market maker going to do?

485
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,860
Hedge perfect. How's he gonna hedge? What's he gonna do?

486
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,210
He just shorted a whole bunch of these shares to some punter 10,000 of these some

487
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,310
big retail whale came in and bought 10,000 of these he's gonna buy how many shares

488
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,890
is he gonna buy?

489
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,730
Oh shit. We're gonna go past nine here guys.

490
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,490
He's gonna buy a hundred eight thirty-eight thousand shares.

491
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,640
Perfect He's gonna buy a hundred and thirty-eight thousand shares and that's gonna

492
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:25,400
make him flat Delta now tomorrow in in three hours Okay in three hours Vol

493
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:37,260
changes in three hours vol changes and it goes from 30 vol to 28 vol Okay,

494
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,860
it goes from 30 vol to 28 vol and I'm pretty sure the way that Jim croissant The

495
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,600
way he does it is he does it through how the stock moves with spot price,

496
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:47,940
right? You know,

497
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,510
you have different volatilities for different different strikes And so let's say

498
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:02,720
vol drops 28 to 28 it drops to Vegas For goes from 30 to 28 three hours later Okay,

499
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,760
you're gonna get her support resistance zone levels on Twitter.

500
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:23,040
So now this market maker is only short 121,000 234 Delta he was short a hundred

501
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,280
thirty-eight thousand He bought a hundred thirty-eight thousand shares,

502
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,060
but now he's only short 121,000. But guess what? What's the issue here?

503
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:38,040
What is our issue here? Perfect perfect Eric now, he's long Delta. In fact,

504
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:45,460
he's long about 17,000 shares Vol drops two points and now he's long 17,000 shares.

505
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,960
So what does he need to do?

506
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,080
He needs to go and sell 17,000 shares and to be honest guys,

507
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,300
this is actually not what really happens in the market Rule number one about options

508
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,870
is hedge if you're if you're trading options hedge with options as a market maker

509
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,830
But let's go say he goes and he sells 17,000 shares. Well,

510
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,050
this is a resistance level right at because let's say for example Jim Cousin says

511
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:20,630
if this because remember vol and as the stock moves Volatility changes if it's for

512
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,840
example when the queues go down Well,

513
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,280
the queues are gonna be increasing volatility So deltas are gonna change but as

514
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,940
the stock goes up, well,

515
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,860
guess what vol is gonna drop And so that's gonna change the deltas.

516
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,560
And so that's where he gets those support resistance from I'm pretty sure is that

517
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,880
you know The spot of eyeball correlation plus the Vanna flows,

518
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:50,840
right if spot were to rally 1% Let's say or to this support level vols would drop

519
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:58,420
X amount Meaning the market makers are gonna have to sell X amount of shares Dropping

520
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:04,100
the stock price Okay, but here's our here's our problem guys.

521
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:12,250
Here's the big problem For 10k short options contracts,

522
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:23,240
we need to trade 17,000 shares 17,000 shares on let's say something like the SPY

523
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:29,730
Apple that trades a hundred million shares a day 17,000 shares.

524
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:34,480
I'm pretty sure Neil does this on a daily basis and Neil doesn't move the market

525
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:42,610
Okay, the practicality of this in my opinion is ridiculous Right,

526
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,640
even if we bump this up to a hundred thousand contracts That's a hundred and seventy

527
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,910
thousand shares on a stock that trades a hundred million dollars Hundred million

528
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:01,450
shares a day and we're not even talking about all the other flows But we're not

529
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:11,300
even talking about all these flows the VOMA the color of the Zoma If the market

530
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,080
maker short a bunch of call options as a stock rallies Well,

531
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,440
he's got you gotta buy more and more and more just from the gamma exposure But the

532
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,820
Vanna exposure is telling themselves so it's like there's not only Vanna exposure

533
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,040
in the market, right?

534
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,220
there's so many more and I honestly think in my personal and I've never met a profitable

535
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,180
trader that You know, like these are second-order, you know,

536
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,800
these are these are second-order derivatives Right,

537
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,340
they don't what about the first order?

538
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,960
What about just betting on the direction of the stock?

539
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,180
You're gonna make way more money betting on the direction of the stock than betting

540
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,440
on You know the second-order effect to figure out the Delta before you try to figure

541
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,120
out the Vanna Right the change of Delta with respect to Vanna try to figure out

542
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,860
the Delta first That's where the money is.

543
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,780
The money is not in this third fourth order derivative,

544
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,100
you know But it's a complex situation that not a lot of people understand.

545
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,630
And so for that reason it's easy to kind of in my opinion you know,

546
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,580
maybe not but I feel like you know,

547
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,220
it's easier to raise capital if you know people think you're some amazing creature

548
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,300
And no one really understands you and we Sean and I actually get a lot of messages

549
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,920
guys. Can you explain Vanna? Can you like how are these guys doing it?

550
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,040
It's because we don't understand it yet everyone, you know,

551
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,640
everyone's hyping them up And so I think it's a way to raise capital in my opinion

552
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:40,180
But this is this is Vanna this is charm in a nutshell Actually in pretty I'd say

553
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,540
pretty in-depth This is what Vanna and charm is and now you guys know so,

554
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:44,900
you know,

555
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:57,510
congrats now you understand Vanna and charm flows So right saying they're nonlinear

556
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:03,100
and so we need these second or derivative guidance So red I you know,

557
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:11,070
I would I would actually I would disagree with that just simply because as a trader

558
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,950
We want to we want to figure out where? Where can I make the most money, right?

559
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:18,310
You know,

560
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,030
there's a there's a lot of guys on Twitter For example trying to price these like

561
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,630
Delta five options or these Delta three options, right?

562
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,230
And and let's and let's take a look at it real quick.

563
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:37,460
So So let's say we're doing $100 stock and we're trading a hundred and twenty dollar

564
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,340
strike and Like I see this constantly, right?

565
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,200
I see this constantly and it's trading out Let's say point four vol for 40% volatility

566
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:52,100
zero interest rates and one month expiration Does anyone know how to I I actually

567
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,680
I have it as a hyphenation. Does anyone know how to change that to?

568
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,860
So I can have this like the slash again Or did I mess up big?

569
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,970
change keyboard You know what? Okay.

570
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,810
Actually I have I have an example right here.

571
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,560
So let's say we're doing $120 strike John's gonna kill me.

572
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,720
I'm not gonna tell I'm not gonna say anything.

573
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:24,280
He's just gonna come back and everything's gonna be apostrophes apostrophe Okay,

574
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,860
$100 strike $120 call option and we're gonna say 40 40 fall Right and a lot of people

575
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,440
are actually trying to price this they're saying hey,

576
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,450
the tails are super cheap The tails are super cheap. Okay,

577
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:40,910
so when we when we price this out It's trained for 27 cents.

578
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,900
All right train for 27 cents.

579
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:52,410
And if we think let's say it's worth 50 vol Right now we might get a big return

580
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,800
on capital Okay, we might get a big return on capital.

581
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,790
But the reality is is That it's hard to actually get size on in the wings,

582
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:08,240
right? This is the practicality side Right, so we go from 27 cents to 70 cents,

583
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,360
right?

584
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:15,130
So we're gaining we're gaining 40 cents here On an option that we think is 10 points

585
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:22,570
underpriced Now the reality is is that it's 40 cents, right?

586
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:27,610
You to get you know You have to get a crazy amount of size on right if you want

587
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:32,670
to let's say make four hundred thousand dollars You have to buy What is that a million

588
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,510
of these contracts?

589
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:38,010
You can't get that size on right and that's where a lot of the time when I see these

590
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,670
guys on Twitter It's like well,

591
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:43,570
you can tell who the who the who the academic is versus who the practitioner is,

592
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,310
right?

593
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,870
I'm trying to wish we are trying to get some serious money from dollars We're trying

594
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,200
to get how much dollars can we extract from the market, right?

595
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,100
And so, you know trying to price these wings,

596
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,380
you know using fancy words like kurtosis or you know,

597
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,540
other words is It's not from a practitioner standpoint.

598
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,780
Okay, so right I'm gonna get a second.

599
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:22,500
Let me just read what's going on here Chick saying Jordan who warehouses the risk

600
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,380
at the end of the day like even if market makers hedging where does the risk end

601
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,000
up? Yes,

602
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,540
really good question so The risk is gonna end up to the person taking on the risk

603
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:36,660
if I if I'm a market maker Okay, so let's say I'm going long Delta's Okay,

604
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,330
and I buy a call option Well, I'm not gonna be hedging.

605
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,470
Let's say I'm actually bullish on the shares I'm gonna buy this call option and

606
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:43,830
you know,

607
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,310
I mix I want that exposure I want that exposure to the Delta but the market maker

608
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,490
is actually gonna do is he's gonna sell me that a call option He's actually not

609
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:56,800
gonna buy shares What he's going to do is buy the option closest to my ex to my

610
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,650
strike Right, because why is it now?

611
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:03,110
Let me ask you that question chicks Why would the why would the market maker instead

612
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:07,370
of buying my option from or selling my option and then buying shares to hedge?

613
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,690
Why would he go and buy the nearest strike option?

614
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,690
What do you think?

615
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,480
One second guys. What do you think chicks?

616
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:23,040
Why would he buy the nearest strike option versus buying the shares?

617
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:37,570
Does anyone else want to help chicks here? What's it? She's gonna say You know,

618
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:47,070
you're the man, you know, you got it Obviously better than the spread Okay.

619
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,610
Okay chicks. Yeah, you're absolutely right.

620
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:54,490
Okay The reason why he would trade the options instead of the and this is this is

621
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:55,010
the rule, right?

622
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:59,150
The rule is if you can hedge with options head with a hedge with options don't hedge

623
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:03,110
with shares But for some reason Twitter things everyone had just the shares The

624
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,670
reason is because if the market maker buys those shares,

625
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,370
he just closes out his Delta's.

626
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,670
He didn't close out his Vega He didn't close out his theta.

627
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,920
He didn't close out his gamma and he doesn't want that.

628
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:17,260
The market maker doesn't want that exposure He's trying to remain as flat as possible

629
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,890
and just collect the spread Right.

630
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:25,230
So when he sells you that option You can try to buy the nearest strike option to

631
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,210
get rid of those exposures and whatever he has left Which is gonna be basically

632
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:34,130
zero theta and zero gamma and zero Vega right price two options right beside each

633
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,090
other The the Vega and gamma exposure is basically zero There might be a little

634
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,910
bit of Delta left over and so he might hedge that off But they might have other

635
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:47,410
stuff in his book that hedges that Delta So,

636
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,590
you know most of the time the guy is not gonna be hedging with shares now if you

637
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:54,030
let's say he goes into a Super liquid option you might buy he might you know any

638
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,630
and also guys another very important point as well He does the quicker he can turn

639
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,210
over his book the better So what that means is if he can sell you that so there's

640
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,310
something called like a zero tick rule And you know,

641
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,090
this is more like like higher finance,

642
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:12,500
which we won't talk about today But we can talk about on another life if he can

643
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,100
get rid of that option as quick as possible He's he is happy to do that.

644
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,960
So if he doesn't have to hedge and he can just offset it to someone else as quickly

645
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,080
as possible he's uh He's very happy.

646
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,260
And the other thing we don't know is what's in the market makers book For example,

647
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,070
the market maker might be super long Delta and so by him selling you those call

648
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:38,360
options He doesn't need a hedge with shares because he's already super long Delta

649
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,280
And in fact,

650
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,430
he wanted you to see he wanted to sell you that call option right to get some short

651
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:48,730
Deltas So there's a whole bunch of reasons and I think I think there's a lot of

652
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:54,060
marketing going on You know a lot of raising capital going on in this space,

653
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:59,790
but it's my opinion I think red has a really good post that we should we should

654
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:05,430
chat about here So red spent a lot of time ball or ballpark in the ranges for cross

655
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:10,860
Delta hedging Red as I type this if you don't mind explaining a little bit.

656
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,640
So first cross Delta hedging You don't mind swing that as I read more With more

657
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,000
precise guides I could focus more on trading without having to having to do so much

658
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:33,820
mental math and guesswork And not compromise how much size I'm using Okay,

659
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:41,390
so Red I spent a lot of time as well thinking about Delta hedging but I spent a

660
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,270
little bit my time.

661
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,940
I spent a little bit of time thinking about a little bit different the time I spend

662
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,950
on Delta hedging is Do I want to add costs?

663
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,050
Right every time we Delta hedge we add a cost right and there's really there's no

664
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,870
way There's no two ways around that when you trade it's expensive to trade you have

665
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:02,950
to usually pay slippage You have to pay commission not just coming in but going

666
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,270
out once you put a position on to Delta hedge You also have to pay that coming out

667
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:11,480
when you close out the position So when we trade we're really it's really a concept

668
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,840
of do we reduce volatility aka hedging?

669
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,520
by increasing Transaction costs and that comes straight out of the bottom line.

670
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,110
Okay, so When we every time we trade it costs money now,

671
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:34,940
that's always the trade-off variance reduction versus Taking money away from the

672
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,700
bottom line, right? Our expected value is gonna be the same.

673
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,860
So as we all as a lot of you guys are aware of Wow, this lives getting long.

674
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,060
Okay, we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna cut it here,

675
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:55,120
but I'm gonna quickly Quickly share this Okay When we trade an option their path

676
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,640
dependent, right and this is because the gamma is not constant Oh, you know,

677
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,500
we're gonna obviously down the road Hopefully we'll talk about this,

678
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,080
but we might have our P&L go up here. It might go down here.

679
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,140
It might go up here Right.

680
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:15,980
These are all different paths that we could take but the the the expectancy Okay,

681
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:21,350
the expectancy of all these paths are right here Okay,

682
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:30,660
now we have a choice to make we can either one embrace this Embrace that one time.

683
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,640
We're not gonna make money one time. We're gonna make a lot of money Okay,

684
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:41,520
or what we could do is this we can Delta hedge Which would allow us to have a tighter

685
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,260
path Okay.

686
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:51,590
Okay variance reduction But because of our transaction costs we drop our expected

687
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:55,310
value to let's say right over here Okay,

688
00:58:55,350 --> 00:59:02,710
so we reduced our variance But we increased or we decreased our long run expectancy

689
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:09,740
So I wouldn't be too concerned blue about You know,

690
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,380
when do I Delta hedge right if you if you're can if you're thinking when do I Delta

691
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,240
hedge? That is a totally separate strategy.

692
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,210
What that's basically telling you is that you can trade the underline, right?

693
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:27,210
If you are having timing if you are timing your Delta hedges You are trading the

694
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:30,710
underlying and so you there should you if you have an edge in Delta?

695
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:35,410
You shouldn't be trading the vol because you can make so much more in Delta Right.

696
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:40,310
So really embrace that is the fact that if you are gonna be Delta hedging due to

697
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:45,090
you know Some other strategy that you're implementing on top of your vol,

698
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,530
right? It's a second strategy.

699
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,860
And so you should really think about what can I actually trade the underlying on

700
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:57,720
its own, right? In that case, I think you should you know, and you know,

701
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,960
of course if you can add a vol component to it You know you get double the edge

702
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:08,800
But I can't speak to the actual strategy of Delta hedging itself. Okay,

703
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:14,700
I can't speak to and when I say The strategy I mean Treating it as a Delta one strategy.

704
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,370
Oh, yeah, right if you can post to all panelists,

705
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:34,220
I'd be great So Ram saying can you explain can you explain variance sure Ram so

706
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,340
here you can see Ram Let's take a look at the red paths.

707
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,620
Okay And if you go to the advanced chat I posted about this today,

708
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,840
so right now I'm actually experiencing this Right.

709
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,520
I'm experiencing this but if I Delta hedged I could have experienced this Right,

710
01:00:52,520 --> 01:01:01,310
but that also means that I give up this so Picture this Ram as the y-axis is our

711
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:01,710
P&L.

712
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,220
Okay,

713
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:14,050
and x-axis is time Imagine this Ram you buy a you buy a straddle This is similar

714
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:19,990
what happened to me you buy a straddle and the stock goes up 10% down 30% up 70

715
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:26,800
% and then at expiration Closes flat closes at your strike. Well,

716
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,420
you're gonna experience this part right here,

717
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:38,350
right where you made no money But the vol was crazy now sometimes with the same

718
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:46,600
volatility The stock could have gone like this up 10% up 50% up 70% up 90% and then

719
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:52,720
you experience this Right where you made a ton of money because you never Delta

720
01:01:52,720 --> 01:02:01,720
hedged so that's the variance in the P&L the day-to-day the variance right variance

721
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:07,410
meaning like You know is your P&L straight or is your P&L all over the place?

722
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:14,220
But the end result right the end result if you're let's say buying an option at

723
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:18,580
30 vol But it's realizing 40 vol. Okay.

724
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,730
Well your end result is gonna be positive But the path it takes could be up here

725
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:28,700
or it could be down here or anywhere in between Okay,

726
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,420
and the green line is if you decide to Delta hedge, well,

727
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,750
you're gonna reduce that variance You're gonna reduce that variance a ton Now the

728
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,210
more you hedge the less you the more you reduce the variance,

729
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:46,660
but the more transaction costs So that's why we always say right the transaction

730
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:53,800
costs come out of the bottom line no matter what those are gone So we have to decide

731
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,200
do we want to reduce variance Right.

732
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,370
So for example portfolio manager at firm is gonna reduce variance for sure But at

733
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:17,180
the same time he's also gonna pay up a lot of costs So

734
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,760
red was just saying, you know,

735
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,520
basically if you're short gamma you're trading against the market defensively But

736
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,360
if you could pick points to where you know, where's optimal hedging,

737
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,620
you know You're obviously gonna do better and which I agree, you know,

738
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,380
if you can trade Delta one and a vol spectrum You're gonna do phenomenally well

739
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,060
So red just saying like,

740
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,780
you know when you're when you're short gamma You got to be defensive or you got

741
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,680
a hedge like if the market starts blowing through the roof You can't be like,

742
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,420
you know, come on come back come back.

743
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:56,060
You got a hedge quick When you're long gamma,

744
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,180
you cannot you can you afford to let it run?

745
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:05,150
Okay guys Wow 915 that was a long one,

746
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,290
but I hope you guys I hope you actually guys got a lot out of this one you know,

747
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,750
I So basically what I what I really wanted you guys to really understand from this

748
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:15,840
life is you guys are trading the meat Okay,

749
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,580
you guys are trying to find where's vol mispriced is it, you know,

750
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:24,380
where is Vega mispriced and that is the first order Right, just like spot.

751
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,980
Where's the stock mispriced? Where can I get Delta?

752
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,590
That is the first order and that's where the meat is Right,

753
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:34,500
and that's where we want to be as retail traders Trying to get the highest return

754
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,000
on capital.

755
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,460
That is where we want to be high highest dollar return That's where we want to be.

756
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:45,850
We want to be trading that meat So don't worry too much about the third-order derivatives,

757
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:50,330
I know it's all online I know it's super pumped up and it's super pumped up for

758
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:56,670
the reasons. We've talked about earlier Okay, and as you guys saw,

759
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:03,600
you know Trading $100,000 trading a hundred thousand contracts barely changes the

760
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:10,590
changes the market makers book relative to the overall volume and We don't even

761
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:14,090
know if the market makers hedging Right, so you guys can see right there.

762
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,880
It's a You know,

763
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:27,440
it's for me at least I'm very very very skeptical about this Trick is saying can

764
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:33,210
we do a big live on VIX VIX and VXX chicks? We can definitely do that Koa,

765
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,030
how can I make money? You can't that's the whole part. Uh-huh.

766
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:41,760
That's that's the caveat to this live that third order Greeks second order Greeks

767
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,220
is Is You know, it's second order. It's third order, right?

768
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,610
It's All our lives cool on first order stuff.

769
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:59,390
That's where I think you're gonna make a lot of money Red we got it. We got it.

770
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:10,230
We got you, buddy Okay. Well guys, thank you so much for showing up.

771
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:17,560
I really hope you guys got a lot of that and And I'll see you later. Yeah,

772
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,200
Neil so you can make money with gamma. Yes,

773
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,780
but Neil remember we really only use Yes,

774
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,350
I agree with that no gamma is probably one of the only one of the only things that

775
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:32,540
You know,

776
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:38,640
we can actually Make quite a bit of money from and that's it's not You know,

777
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,970
I'm gonna have to do a whole live on that. Okay,

778
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:48,970
because it's actually it's It's not really the gamma Okay,

779
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,870
it's not really the gamma guys.

780
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:56,830
It's really the vol The vol which way the Vega right when you're long straddle you're
