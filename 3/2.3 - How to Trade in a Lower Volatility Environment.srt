1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,030
All right, guys, so in this live,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,190
we're going to be talking about how to value vol in this type of environment.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,210
And when I say this type of environment,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:18,300
I'm talking about a not as high vol environment as what we were just in. Okay,

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,280
so for example, VIX at 16 seems low, but if you look at the VIX over the last,

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,160
let's say, five years, it's extremely high.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,680
It's just because in the last one year, we've had VIX 25.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,080
And so it's like we're coming off the freeway. And all of a sudden,

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,580
we feel like we're going extremely fast, or no,

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,100
we feel like we're going really slow,

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,310
even though we're actually going extremely fast. Okay,

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,750
so that's what it kind of feels like. And this live,

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,910
I just wanted to basically talk about how do we price vol? How do we say,

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,870
you know, is volatility still expensive? Is it still cheap?

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,510
And we can go from there. It's funny, Jordan, remember,

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,020
so my birthday was a couple weeks ago, and I rented out like a, like a Mustang,

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,100
just to rip around. And I got it up to pretty good speeds,

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,380
having a great time with it. And then exactly said, like, you know,

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,300
I was back in like the neighborhood and I was going slow,

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,580
or it felt like I was going slow, but I was going like 60 or 70.

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,490
You know what I mean? And I literally felt like I was crawling,

22
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,910
but I'm still driving at a speed where like, if I crashed, I might die.

23
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,630
You know what I mean? But it felt like I was crawling,

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,810
like the car wasn't neutral. Right.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,170
And that's sort of what you're alluding to is how the vol environment currently

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,430
feels, where there is still implied vol, there's still realized vol,

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,480
but it's not, it's not, we're not in a, in pandemic territory anymore. Exactly.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,400
I saw someone on Twitter say like, VIX seems like value right now,

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,000
but in actual fact, it's like a GME, you know, went from $4 to $350.

30
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,320
And now that it's at $200 or $150, it seems like value,

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,750
but in the grand scheme of things, it's still not. So I think that's, you know,

32
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,310
a lot of people, they thought the VIX floor was at 20 and we just saw it just,

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,730
you know, capitulate and implode and go down to 15.

34
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,310
So why don't we chat about it? And, you know, even some of the PA guys here,

35
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,430
members are going to be getting tripped up because things like the volcon,

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,900
right? Everything on the volcon right now is under the median,

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,300
but that's because of the look back window that that median is taking into consideration

38
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,200
is what is it? Is it 18 months, Jordan? Yes. 18, right? Right.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,280
So it's a 18 month look back. And of those 18 months, 15 of them are, you know,

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,880
chaos, right?

41
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,490
So this live will help you navigate the current landscape a lot better.

42
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,290
That's the goal. So make sure you ask questions along the way.

43
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,950
I'll be monitoring the chat, Jordan. Yep. Let's get into it. Okay.

44
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,790
Let me just pull this here. One second. All right.

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,820
Let me share my screen.

46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,380
And guys ask questions along the way. All right. Very important. Yeah.

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,860
I'll keep my eye on the chat here, Jordan. Don't worry.

48
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,940
Right. Everyone can see my screen.

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,840
So right now I'm just looking at the S&P and what we notice, right?

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,340
Let me just take off the max here is the vols are at the lows, right?

51
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,980
And we're not just seeing this with the S&P.

52
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,660
So when we're looking at the volatility cone, let me just,

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,850
I'm going to take out a couple here. I'm going to take out the median.

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,640
Actually I'll take out the first quantile and the third quantile there.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,380
So what we're seeing here is that vols are at the lows, right?

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,360
16 months ago or 14 months ago, COVID started or, you know,

57
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,500
vols started picking up. And so we're almost at just, you know,

58
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,380
just before the COVID lows. And a lot of people are saying, Hey, this is value.

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,760
This is looking like value. And we're seeing this across the board, right?

60
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,920
Every single equity, we saw Pfizer back down to pre COVID lows, right?

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,220
In terms of vol. And it's,

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,560
it seems like it's getting harder and harder to find short vol opportunities.

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,640
Yet we're seeing the VIX go from 20 to 15, right?

64
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,300
And this should go much lower, right?

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,500
VIX should all the way back down to remember those days when it was nine,

66
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,550
right? Not saying it's going there anytime soon,

67
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,610
but it could be making its way back down there.

68
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,370
And so even though we're looking at 15 VIX, it actually may not be real value.

69
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,720
And so a good way to compare if something is over or under priced,

70
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,390
we need something to compare it to. And as you guys know, we don't, we don't,

71
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,650
I don't think we've ever talked about macro vol. Do we talk about that, Sean?

72
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,410
Three circles, man. That's it. Yeah. Right.

73
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,350
It's we don't talk about what the S&P is doing tomorrow.

74
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,300
And the reason we don't do that is because it's too competitive, right? It's,

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,500
it's too many players are trying to play this game.

76
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,720
And I'm not too sure why I would want to participate in this, right?

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,380
Which is way too, it's way too sophisticated. There's so many parts happening.

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,920
There's so many good players happening, you know, trading in that space.

79
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,860
I don't know why I would want to want to be in there. So breaking the alpha,

80
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,280
you're rarely going to hear me saying, hey,

81
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:02,580
I'm selling as an offset of something, but it's never going to be my alpha leg.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm never going to be taking a view just strictly on S&P vol. Rarely,

83
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,800
very rare. But what the S&P does do is it serves as a benchmark.

84
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,520
S&P vol is extremely, extremely efficient. It's the most liquid market.

85
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,700
It's got the biggest players. It's got the most eyes. Okay.

86
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,720
It is going to be priced the most efficiently.

87
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,920
And so the way that we use it is a benchmark, right? Where is this?

88
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,520
Where is volatility right now? What, what is fair value?

89
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,690
And then we go out and we say, okay, well, this is fair value. What's this at?

90
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,210
Is this cheap or expensive given we know this?

91
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,180
And so that's what we're going to be talking about today is using the S&P,

92
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,200
NASDAQ vol can be used the same as a benchmark, as the fair value, right?

93
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,000
And then you trade the inefficiencies that are happening around it.

94
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,820
So how do we do that? How do we do that? Well, we know that basically,

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,200
Ivy rank is low for everything right now. So we can't just go, you know,

96
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,260
if we're using that as our signal,

97
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,530
we're always going to be long vol over the next year, right?

98
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,450
And that could be devastating. So we need another way to figure this out.

99
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,830
So I'm going to go over to relative value tab here and for the relative value tab.

100
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,920
Okay. There we go. For relative value tab,

101
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,190
what I'm going to do is I'm going to plot S&P vol, my apologies.

102
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,470
I realized that there's some few tiny bugs on this,

103
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,010
but I think we're going to be good here.

104
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,630
Okay.

105
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,610
So we're going to plot the S&P and what I'm plotting is the implied volatility 30

106
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,730
day over divided by the realized volatility 30 day.

107
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,130
And that the divide by is coming from the ratio here.

108
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,250
And so what we can see is that right now,

109
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,710
implied volatility is 1.3 times the realized vol. Okay.

110
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,530
We can see the realized vol right here, right?

111
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:16,970
Realized vols at 10 and implied vol right now is 1.3 times the realized vol.

112
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,850
So this is going to be our benchmark. Okay.

113
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,790
We know that implied vol and realized vol are correlated. Okay. We know that.

114
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,110
So instead of what we need to do is say, okay, well,

115
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,110
this asset is trading at 1.3 times the realized vol. Now,

116
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,250
anything that's trading above that should be expensive.

117
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,830
Anything trading below that should be cheap. So to do that,

118
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,750
I'm going to plot Apple.

119
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,280
For some reason, you have to run this twice.

120
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,900
I don't know what the deal is here, but so what do we know?

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,160
So let's focus on this graph right here. Okay. We have two graphs.

122
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm going to go step-by-step very slow.

123
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,020
So we'd make sure we all understand this. We have two graphs here.

124
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,760
One graph in green is Apple's implied vol 30 divided by Apple's realized vol 30.

125
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,310
In blue is the S&P vol 30 divided by the realized vol 30.

126
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:26,440
And what we see here, okay, is that they move together, right?

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
They usually don't get too far out of line.

128
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:39,520
And so this is what we can use to compare the rest of the assets, right?

129
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,900
Implied vol right now,

130
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:50,830
it should be about 1.3 to 1.4 times the realized volatility. All right.

131
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,270
And when we see something that's way out of line,

132
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,300
that could be a good indication if something's cheap or expensive.

133
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,810
So I'm going to do, I'm going to do,

134
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,330
so does anyone have any questions about that before I continue?

135
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,780
I'm not seeing any. Okay. You guys, sure. We're using, we're saying, okay,

136
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,260
what is the implied vol of this asset over realized vol?

137
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,680
Because that's how we have to compare it, right? Sure. Implied vol is cheap,

138
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,320
but realized vol is even less. So we can, we need, we, you know,

139
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,080
we can't say S&P VIX should be, let's say 20 or 30, right?

140
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,180
We can't say that because it's only realizing 10, right? That's, that's,

141
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,680
you know, everyone would be a seller at 20 VIX.

142
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,840
Everyone would be a seller at 25 VIX, right? And so it's going to come down.

143
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,540
We need to compare it to what's happening right now, which is the realized vol.

144
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,240
And so that, like that is our benchmark. Okay. 1.3,

145
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,800
that's the efficient benchmark. Implied vol should be 1.3 times realized vol.

146
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,120
Okay.

147
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,660
So I was talking to Margin. I don't know if he's on the call.

148
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,260
No margin. Okay. Talking to Margin about SMBR. And we were just looking,

149
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,540
you know, he was looking for earnings trade today and he said, look,

150
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:22,520
implied vols, there's no way implied volatility is going to go down to 49.

151
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,360
This is the lows he said, right? 49 is the lows.

152
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,080
There's no way the day after the event, it's going down to 49.

153
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,640
So maybe it's going to go to 55, right? But let's take a look at S&P.

154
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,030
Okay. The S&P, unfortunately, like these are the lows here, 16.

155
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:55,300
The S&P has dropped below that, right? It's now 14. It was 13, right?

156
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,060
So it can go lower and it will go lower. And the way we need to, you know,

157
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,240
figure out, well, how much, how much lower is it going to go? Right.

158
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,620
We need that comparison.

159
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,690
We need to take a guess, right? Well,

160
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,430
what does implied vol going to go to after the event?

161
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,460
And does anyone have an idea of how we would compare this? Does anyone,

162
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,740
does anyone have an idea on how we would figure out where this is going to go given

163
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,500
what we just noticed?

164
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,790
Does anyone want to take a guess? Last earnings. Last earnings. Okay.

165
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:41,540
So you think it's going to go down to 57 currently trading at 68.

166
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,560
You think it's going to go down to 57. What do you guys think?

167
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,820
Where's implied vol going to go after the event?

168
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,740
You're saying, can't you just run the same ratio of IB to RV? Thank you.

169
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,360
Who said that one? Adam. Adam. Thank you. So let's take a look at RV. Okay.

170
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,800
Okay. We're going to go over to the, uh, to relative value.

171
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,240
Um,

172
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:20,930
and I gotta, I gotta figure out why I have to run this twice to get it.

173
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,520
It's very strange.

174
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,240
Hmm. You know what guys? Eric's saying change your top left ticker. Ah,

175
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,200
that's why. That's it. Thank you.

176
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,430
There we go. Thank you.

177
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,080
Uh, so we should see a 1.3 times after the event. And now, um,

178
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,200
so something else to keep in mind here, guys is for SNBR. Um,

179
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,740
I don't know why I have these on here.

180
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,520
Okay. Uh, for SNBR, uh,

181
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,020
I know realized right now for the last 30 days of 64 in the last 10 days,

182
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,640
it's only been 30. Okay. In the last 10 days, there was some, uh,

183
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,500
some ball to that happened here recently. Um, and that's, that's going to be,

184
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,780
you know,

185
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,280
a little bit of a nuance and single names because you could have like one day of

186
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,900
a big event. Right. And that changes the whole vault, the realized volatility.

187
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,560
So you gotta be very mindful of that. Um, for these, uh,

188
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,710
for these single names, which is different than in the index. So if we had to,

189
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,910
if we knew, let's say realized volatility was at 30. Okay.

190
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:48,090
We would say that implied vault should be 30 times 1.3 or 40. Right.

191
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,510
And that's what, you know, that's what I would be guessing. Um,

192
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,310
I think actually realized vol is like 35, uh,

193
00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:02,140
the last 10 days I was looking up on, uh, uh, on my, on my data feed. Um,

194
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,740
so in this case, right, we see realized vols at 64. Uh, we would say, okay,

195
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,340
64 times 1.3 should be the implied vault. However,

196
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,980
realized vault last 10 days has been very, very low.

197
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,700
We could actually see that in the volatility analyzer here. Uh,

198
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,200
here's the realized vol, right. It's been, it's basically nothing. Oh, here,

199
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,000
right.

200
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,470
Realized vol realized vol is at 41. Okay.

201
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,770
Realized vol the last 10 days is at 41. And so 41 times 1.3,

202
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:44,040
it's going to give us something like 50 vol. Okay. 53 vol.

203
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,380
And so that's what we think, uh,

204
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,090
the implied volatility is going to come to after the event, but, you know,

205
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,330
looking at, looking at the, um, you know, if we don't look at it like that,

206
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,010
right. Well, implied vol doesn't seem so high.

207
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,760
It doesn't seem too high right now. Right.

208
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,480
And how are we going to sell an earnings event when implied vol is not even in the

209
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,640
third quantile. And the reason for that is because, um, we're coming off,

210
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,180
you know, extreme volatility. Do you guys have any questions about that?

211
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,650
We just turn on the light here. One second, guys. I guess it's getting dark,

212
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,530
starting to look shadow of vol again. Exactly.

213
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,760
So Ram just wants you to confirm, uh, how you got 1.3. I used the S&P vol.

214
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,380
And the actual fact is,

215
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,860
so when you guys get more skilled and you get better and better at this,

216
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,680
you do this over and over.

217
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,370
Um, 1.3 is going to be high.

218
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,740
1.3 is going to be high because does anyone know why that 1.3 is going to be high?

219
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,180
So 1.3 is what S&P is. S&P implied vol to realize vol.

220
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,140
Why is 1.3 going to be high?

221
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,490
Eric's saying because the market overstates vol. Exactly. Right.

222
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:16,460
The S&P it's well-known and well-documented that index vol, uh, is, is,

223
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,880
has a lot higher risk premia than single name vol. A lot higher risk premia.

224
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,610
So you're, it's going to overstate slightly more than, um,

225
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,870
a single name equity.

226
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,020
So we might have 1.25 and we're going to look at similar ones.

227
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,240
We're gonna look at similar companies, right? Um, we're going to, you know,

228
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,280
try to find, we're going to do as much research.

229
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,860
And we did a relative value on the other day where we did DISCA.

230
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,350
We talked about, uh, you know, relative value, um, and, and valuing assets.

231
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,950
You're going to have to spend some time and value the vol.

232
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:57,370
Okay. And the way we use it is S&P is benchmark. Get S&P, try to get,

233
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,070
get a basket of stocks that is similar to the one you're looking at,

234
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,080
see what they're doing. And then, you know, rank them, right?

235
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,550
You can rank them in the scanner here, right? IV versus forecast, right?

236
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:15,390
Or whatever you're looking for. Red's asking is realized volatility, uh,

237
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,470
being used interchangeably with historical volatility here? Yeah, same thing.

238
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,580
Just what happened in the past. And then Crawford's asking,

239
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,960
would the stocks beta be a consideration? Yes. I think that's very good. Right.

240
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,660
So who said that one Crawford, man, our new members really, uh, stepping it up.

241
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,220
Yeah, really stepping it up. No pressure, no pressure. Uh, old members,

242
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,620
no pressure, all members. You guys suck.

243
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,360
Uh, just kidding guys. Just kidding. Um, yes, Crawford. So you could use,

244
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
you know, uh, you can use the correlation here to, to figure that out. Right.

245
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,260
But the issue is sometimes, um,

246
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:02,910
uh,

247
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,690
sometimes the stock is not going to have a high beta to the S&P because it's not

248
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,210
correlated. Right. And if it's, if it's not correlated, um, then it's,

249
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,530
you know, if the beta is not really going to matter here, we're going to put,

250
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,670
uh, we're going to put S&P on the Y on the X axis instead.

251
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,640
Right. So it's like, because there's no real correlation between, uh,

252
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,860
the sleep stock and S the S&P it's not really going to, uh,

253
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,860
the beta is not really going to matter here.

254
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,530
Okay. So I gotta fix something here, but anyways, um,

255
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,470
if the stock is going to be correlated, let's say Microsoft Apple, then yes,

256
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,530
you'd want to use a beta, right. To also get that, you know,

257
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,070
how correlated is this thing? Uh,

258
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,030
and then you would multiply the beta times the vol. So the vol,

259
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,700
let's say the beta was two and S&P vol was 30, then fair value would be 60.

260
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,720
And you can see here, like the rolling correlation between the two, you know,

261
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,420
it's, uh, it's 17%. Like it's nothing, you know,

262
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,040
it's definitely not high correlation.

263
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,180
So you can't, you wouldn't, you wouldn't use the S&P beta here.

264
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,520
The other questions. Nope. That's it for now. We'll keep it moving. Okay. So,

265
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,740
well, I mean, that that's, that's really it, right? Like I, right guys,

266
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,440
we're coming in, we're,

267
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,080
we're in a new environment now and we can't be just looking at IV rank, right.

268
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,380
We need to be able to find another way to value this.

269
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,540
So let's, uh, let's talk about this then Jordan. Uh,

270
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,340
is this the same methodology you would apply when looking at like a, uh, uh,

271
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,400
a play on realized volatility versus implied volatility and on a current implied

272
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,100
vol versus future implied vol level, would you use the same thing?

273
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,660
So short dated options, long dated options. Yeah. Yeah. You can,

274
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,680
in the relative value tab, you can do, um,

275
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,120
because it's still correlated at the 90 day, uh, on, on 90 tenors.

276
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,250
So instead of IV30, you would maybe do IV90 day, right? You're just,

277
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,290
you're trying to value this thing as much as possible. Um,

278
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,530
but one thing that you shouldn't be doing, and I honestly would say it's a,

279
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,460
it would be a naive way to think about it is because is if, because VIX is low,

280
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,750
that means it should go back up, right? That's almost never the case. Um,

281
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,720
the best time to sell vol is when vol is low, right? That's,

282
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,180
that's the same people. You say best time to sell vol is when it's high,

283
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,840
best time to sell vol in terms of implied versus realized.

284
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,720
So shorter dated options,

285
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,840
let's say 30 day options and less is going to be when the VIX is low and the vol

286
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,460
is low. And it can just keep bleeding out.

287
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,460
Exactly. Right. And like, if you think about it conceptually,

288
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:24,050
it kind of makes sense why that's the case. Um, you know, when, when,

289
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:29,980
when things are stable, you know, it's, uh, you know, easier to price things.

290
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,190
Uh, you know, it's risk premiums more clear when things are wild, you know,

291
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,830
it's pretty easy to miss the mark.

292
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,150
So the easiest way to think about it is the market has that, uh,

293
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,940
an embedded risk premium that it's easier to collect when in low realized vol environments

294
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,420
than in high realized vol environments,

295
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,400
because the things is so hard to price because it's moving so much.

296
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,580
And people are also more likely to buy vol when things are low,

297
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,050
when vol is low. True. Right. Which is going to get,

298
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,350
which is always going to give that embedded risk premium.

299
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,300
Why? Uh, so, um, let's see, uh, Adam's asking,

300
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,720
could you compare the IVE ratio of a specific stock during a previous period to

301
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,700
the ratio of spy at that time? IVR.

302
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,390
I'm assuming IVR of a stock previously to a stock. No. Yeah. A hundred percent.

303
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,630
Right. Uh, well, let's look at Apple.

304
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,100
You don't have the ratio clicks for a spy, but,

305
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,420
or you don't have spy on at all. I thought you, okay.

306
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,190
You don't need to do anything. Yeah. I didn't. I didn't. Sorry. Okay.

307
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,470
I got a song. Someone's a little buggy here. I got to fix it. But anyways,

308
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,310
you can take a look here, right? Like Apple and spy have all,

309
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,450
you can see that the market is actually using this factor, right?

310
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,010
If the market wasn't using this factor, these things wouldn't be correlated.

311
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,770
So you can see like market makers and other traders use this as one metric.

312
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:20,120
Right. And that's why you see them in the RV, the IVR V they move together. Um,

313
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,190
um, I guess does that answer your question? Uh, Adam,

314
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,090
I think you just said like, you wanted me to plot it, right?

315
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,460
You meant for something like SNBR, if it isn't that correlated to spy,

316
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,950
can you do that? Yes. Yes.

317
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,750
You can still do that because you were looking at the, uh,

318
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,250
at the risk premium that the pricing in relative to what's actually happening right

319
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,670
now. So our corn is asking, uh,

320
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,760
why do this versus the non-event term structure, non-event vol term structure.

321
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,380
So I guess for, uh, for your SN DL trade or whichever company you're in,

322
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:07,760
right.

323
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,850
So in this case, um, we were, we were chatting about it. Let's go to SMBR.

324
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,290
You basically also think non-event vol is expensive,

325
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:25,270
right? So yeah, exactly. Right. So, um, let me just get rid of this.

326
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,130
Okay. So when we look at this, a quarter mile, we see, okay, well front month,

327
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,190
first off there's, there wasn't a lot of data points with SMBR. It was,

328
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,340
it was a monthly contract. Um, and so what we can see here is like, okay,

329
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,100
well sure. Implied vault, you know,

330
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,340
30 days is going to be 68 and non-event falls going to be 60,

331
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,380
but look at the realized vol, right.

332
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,910
It was high, just like the whole market. If I plotted the S and P 500,

333
00:25:53,110 --> 00:26:00,320
30 day vol is high across the board, but over the last 20 days or last 10,

334
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,310
15 days, we've seen vol completely drop off across the, across all assets.

335
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,830
Vol has shrunk. And what do we know about volatility? It clusters, right?

336
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,510
That's probably one of the,

337
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,470
that's probably the strongest factor is that it clusters before being reversion.

338
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:24,130
Um, and so when, when we're seeing, when we're seeing vol at this low level,

339
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:30,240
you know, at these levels here, uh, and we're seeing non-event vol at 60,

340
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,570
it's going to be hard for it to stay up here, right?

341
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,690
One of two things are going to happen, right? Like, well, like,

342
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,590
what do we notice about this relative value graph, right? What, like, what,

343
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,430
what do we notice about this thing? When we divide IV by RV, it mean reverts,

344
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,300
right? And that's a pretty common factor. It's a pretty strong factor.

345
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:58,200
So if we're all the way up here, right. On IV versus, let's say 60, um, uh,

346
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,330
on IV versus RV, right.

347
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,810
If we're all the way up here and it's actually a lot higher right now that we're

348
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:11,320
looking at the 30 day. If this was the, uh, if this was like,

349
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,400
let's say a 10 day, right. This would be extremely, extremely high. And so,

350
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,320
you know, one of two things are going to happen.

351
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,700
Implied vol is going to increase or, uh, sorry,

352
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,200
implied vol is going to decrease or realize vol is going to increase.

353
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,370
So we need to make that decision. And, um, in my opinion, uh,

354
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,050
usually implied vol is the one that eventually matches with realized vol.

355
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,290
It's usually a lot less stable.

356
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:48,130
Cool. Um, let's see. How about if the asset is not in the SMP?

357
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,270
What if it's in something like IWN? Do you use that instead? Yeah,

358
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,890
you can do that instead. As long as the, what you're using is efficient, right?

359
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,710
You're trying to, you're trying to benchmark it to something.

360
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,270
You're trying to say, Hey, look, this is, this is fair value, right?

361
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,990
This is what I think fair value is given this.

362
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,190
And so the thing you're using is not efficient. You know, it's,

363
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,670
it's going to be tough, right? I remember when we were,

364
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,130
we were doing the oil trade. Uh,

365
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,680
I can't remember how long ago this was maybe like 18 months ago or two years ago.

366
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,880
And there was a big, uh,

367
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,200
a whole bunch of oil companies where vols were just through the roof and I had to

368
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,900
compare it to something that was liquid.

369
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,060
And I said, okay, well, given USO vol, what should the, what should the,

370
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,980
you know, similar assets be worth? And then, you know,

371
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,660
you try to find relative value trades or just one leg and trade that.

372
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,170
We have a comment from, uh, our buddy, Mike, I hear he says,

373
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,950
when markets are calm, you collect your VRP. When markets are volatile,

374
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,430
you pay out. It's like insurance.

375
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,560
Yeah. It's, uh, you know,

376
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,580
there's a few guys have done lots of studies on this and it's, uh,

377
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,750
there's a lot of people who've done a lot of studies on this, um,

378
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,730
selling vol during low vol environments pays out the most.

379
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,820
Then when you sell high vol environments,

380
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:27,240
but the thing is we were rarely selling S and P vol, you know, the,

381
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,420
some of the smartest guys, I know trade S and P vol.

382
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,520
I don't know why I'd want to participate there. I just use them as a benchmark.

383
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,040
I say, okay, you guys do your job. You guys are good at your job.

384
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,720
You price this as efficiently as possible. And I'll,

385
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,660
I'm going to use this as my benchmark, or if I need liquidity, I will,

386
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,300
I'll use this because it's very liquid,

387
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:53,120
but I wouldn't try to outprice them for sure. Yeah. You know, I hope, uh,

388
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,760
I hope you guys have some good ideas, uh, uh, flow flowing,

389
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,710
flowing through your minds right now. Cause you know, there's a,

390
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,290
I feel like this, this is a really good library and opened up a lot of, uh,

391
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,720
a lot of potential. Nice. And we'll see, we'll see guys, SMBR,

392
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,360
or we're going to see what vol goes to tomorrow.

393
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,700
Remember it's hard for someone to sell vaults to keep vol at 60 when it's only realizing

394
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,710
40. Right. It's very hard. Eventually, uh, eventually it's going to go back.

395
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,490
So any other questions there? Or we'll, we'll, we'll wrap it up.

396
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,910
I think you put everyone to sleep. Yeah, I normally, I normally do that.

397
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,940
I got started doing a strip tease or something mid, mid, uh, mid-session. Uh,

398
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,400
yeah, that'll, that'll definitely wake people up.

399
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,580
I'll definitely make people up.

400
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,130
Right. But read the, uh, the risk,

401
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,600
the risk characteristics are exactly the same, right? You're short vol,

402
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,220
you're short gamma, you're long theta, whether it's a strangle,

403
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,720
whether it's a straddle, the risk profile is not going to be that different.

404
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,640
Right. How could it be?

405
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,760
Okay. I'm going to stop the recording there, Jordan.
