1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,990
All right, everyone. So in this lecture,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:10,900
we're going to be talking about trade idea generation all the way to Implementation

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,660
and execution. Okay,

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,960
so really the whole process So this might be a little bit of a longer one.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:23,840
We're gonna go through two examples and There's gonna be no well so for each structure

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
right that we were actually going to trade here There's gonna be an optimal trade

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,400
right,

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,940
but sometimes optimal is not best and we'll talk about that as we go through So

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,960
this isn't really intended to be a really You know really tough live,

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,800
but it's a really important live All right. So let's let's jump right into it.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:54,380
Let me just open up my screen here So you'll want to start with how you found her.

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,480
Yeah. Okay. Okay,

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,740
so Just before I show my screen here one thing to keep in mind guys as traders.

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,280
We're always looking for information We're always looking to see what what are other

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,980
people doing? Okay, we're always trying to see. Okay. Well,

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,340
where is there some activity? Where is there somewhere?

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,540
There may be an inefficiency going on Right if we knew for example,

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,680
all Robin Hood traders were trading this one product that was let's say very illiquid

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,160
Well,

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,100
we would obviously know there's gonna be a lot of opportunity there But if we know

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,180
a lot of Robin Hood traders are gonna be trading in the S&P 500.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,750
Well That's not really gonna move the needle, right?

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,770
So we really we as traders we have to stay attuned to the market, right?

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,810
Every time someone says something You think I wonder if there's an idea there or

25
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,390
I wonder if another people or other people are talking about it, right?

26
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,380
That is that is the life of a trader Okay,

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,160
always remember that and I'm sure say it one more time so we can really really understand

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,680
it as traders We have to be attuned to the market. Okay,

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,900
we have to always be thinking in terms of could there be a trade here?

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,880
So quick example,

31
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,980
one of the trades we're gonna be looking at today Was because I was listening to

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,880
Sean's live in the morning But I was listening to Sean's live and I saw another

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,900
trader talking about one of the trades so right off the bat I'm gonna look into

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,180
it and I was like, oh, you know, actually there is something here.

35
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,100
Which one was this?

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,640
Okay,

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,350
so That's how That's a lot of the idea generation is sometimes gonna come from that

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,570
Okay,

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:30,320
so let's jump right into it and ask your questions along the way guys okay,

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,850
so When we're looking for vol opportunities Everyone is gonna be a little different.

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,130
Okay,

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,430
Sean and I we like leaning short vol just because it's usually gonna generate a

43
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,290
High-return long run.

44
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,950
Okay options are on average Overpriced right if if the stock market on average goes

45
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,270
up then on average I want to be long vol a long S&P 500, right?

46
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,210
I don't want to be on average short S&P 500 if in on average it goes up, right?

47
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,550
That being said doesn't mean I don't go short the market Doesn't mean Sean doesn't

48
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,650
take long vol trades Right.

49
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,070
It's just that's usually where I'm looking for first, right?

50
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,080
That's usually where the mispricing is gonna be first Okay,

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,440
so always keep that in mind.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,620
So Right off the bat. I want to look for a short vol trade.

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,910
And so what I do is I come to the volatility insights and Over here.

54
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,130
So here's our cruiser global dashboard you come in but then we head over to volatility

55
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:37,860
insights And so roughly about we can use this screener right now in the equity in

56
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,340
the options market We have thousands of options and thousands of stocks So for that

57
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,380
reason we need something that can help us boil it down right narrow it down So let's

58
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,650
say a handful of ten stocks that we can look into and so First thing we're gonna

59
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,010
look at here And actually I already predefined the screener is I want to see the

60
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,010
implied vol versus the forecast Greater than 1.05.

61
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,960
I want to see implied vol greater than our forecast Right.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,780
Our forecast looks at a lot of historical data.

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,300
It looks at implied volatility data.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:14,360
It looks at how When stocks go up usually right Vol goes down and when stocks go

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
down fall goes up.

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,920
So it takes into that it takes that into account so We want to have our implied

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,620
volatility higher than our forecast right if we're short volatility So I want to

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,340
put this number above 1.05. Okay,

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,480
and this is just saying this is taking the implied volatility number right here

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,300
And dividing it by our forecast It's that simple. Okay.

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,660
The next thing I want to look for is I want I want there to be some vol But I don't

72
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,200
want to trade an asset that has an implied vol of 10 It's just it's just not gonna

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,040
move the needle. So I want to have at least implied volatility Over 35. Okay.

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,270
I want at least some type of implied volatility Right and just for perspective imagine

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,510
S&P vol was trading at 35 and let's say realized vol was trading at 20 Well,

76
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,930
this is a great opportunity, right? It doesn't need to be let's say 90 vol,

77
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,210
right? It's not always about that high IV rank. In fact,

78
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,920
it's actually never just about the high IV rank Okay,

79
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:25,660
or the high implied volatility level next I want I Want IV rank above 60? Okay,

80
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,440
I want implied volatility to be relatively high if I think you know volatility is

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,930
a mean reverting asset All right volatility if we look at it,

82
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,160
right if we look at volatility right here if you look at this green line It goes

83
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,880
up and it comes down It goes up and it comes down you can do this on any stock and

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,480
you always see that it goes up comes down It's mean reverting.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,880
So for that reason if it's high,

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,910
I want to be I want to be in it when it's high Right now that being said there's

87
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,770
opportunities to get in when it's very low Okay,

88
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,330
it's not always the best but I you Generally like to have some type of implied volatility

89
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:09,240
knowing that it can come down So we got IV rank above 60 and what IV rank above

90
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,010
60 just means is that if we look at the data over the last two years Okay,

91
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,530
we want to see that. It's above 60% of the time Okay,

92
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,550
if we look at all the data this point will be above 60% of the time.

93
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,790
Okay?

94
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,740
Yes,

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:39,050
I'll show the Volcom And just like So this this blue line here this light blue line,

96
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,150
for example is the 75th percentile meaning it's 75% of the time. Okay,

97
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,610
so if it's above this not this blue line, right?

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,640
So if we show right now where it's currently All right.

99
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,200
So what stock we're looking at we're looking at arc. Okay,

100
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:04,310
right this baby blue line This is where it is 75% of time and right in on this green

101
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,590
line.

102
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,010
It's above that It's probably above 80% of time so it's gonna be in the let's say

103
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,970
80 percentile right the 80 IV rank So let's keep it going here.

104
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:21,550
So once we have that then we have narrowed it down from 875 stocks to 48 entries

105
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,090
Okay,

106
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,090
the last thing that I want to do is I want to make sure that there's some type of

107
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,890
liquidity Right. There's some type of volume happening here.

108
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:42,310
And now we are at 16 stocks Right. We've narrowed it down From 873 now,

109
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,110
we're down to 16 And the last thing we could do you don't have to do this is you

110
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,130
can increase the price of the asset Right,

111
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,010
maybe we want to see things that are only above 25 Right.

112
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,020
I think that takes out silver. That's what we'll do 20 only above 20, right?

113
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,060
So here we go. Now.

114
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,210
We're down to only 11 stocks But we've just narrowed it down so much to meet our

115
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,310
criteria Now not all of these 11 stocks are gonna be great stocks So they're gonna

116
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,910
be fundamental reasons why something is like that, but in general,

117
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,750
this is gonna be a good start So then what the last thing I like to do is filter

118
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,860
for IV vs forecast So now we're looking at this stocks with the highest IV versus

119
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,300
the forecast and so Okay Make sure that we're really clear on this.

120
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:40,690
What we're basically doing is we have this giant. It's like this Right.

121
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:49,820
We're basically doing is this this is all the assets we could look at We apply our

122
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,420
first filter and now we're only looking at like these ones Right.

123
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
None of these ones made it right if these if every like all these circles would

124
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,260
be different stocks None of them made the cut then what we do is we apply another

125
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,430
filter and maybe you know These ones are the only ones that make it Right,

126
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,890
and then we apply another filter and maybe this is our last filter and now we have

127
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,710
just these ones that we're looking at We basically set a bunch of criteria for ourself,

128
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,200
it's actually four circles jacket Thank you,

129
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,780
but you get my point guys we're trying to do here and say there's all these things

130
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,140
out there and we apply more and more and more filters and we end up taking excluding

131
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,420
a bunch from our search leaving this was a small list to look at that meet a Predefined

132
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,760
criteria for us and then we go deeper on them Right.

133
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,860
Those are the ones that we are worth our time to learn more about And it doesn't

134
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,440
mean that those other ones there's no opportunities but at the end of the day you

135
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,060
are a human being you cannot look at 10,000 stocks with 10,000 options.

136
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,360
You need to be able to find something that's gonna work a strategy that you know

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,280
You've really thought about and that you can bring to the market.

138
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,760
There's something that actually makes sense so if you guys can if you guys actually

139
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,140
So if someone wants to comment if we could sum up this screener in one word what

140
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,300
I just did here right the screener We've just applied all the filters.

141
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,480
We just applied when one word How would you guys sum it up or in two words or like

142
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,140
a sentence? How would you guys sum it up?

143
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes, blessing. So last filter was the IV rank right here,

144
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,600
which we put above 60 Danny said edge. Okay,

145
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,050
it's not actually edge It's not that's not non edge Short vol guys.

146
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,910
Let's think about what is the screener saying? Okay,

147
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,990
Jack is almost everything juice, right?

148
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,590
We are just saying apply this filter Why why would we want to apply this filter

149
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:56,910
filtering towards our view? Okay Getting there.

150
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,670
We're almost there right what we're really saying here right when we think about

151
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,550
what is happening here Okay, remember the market is efficient most of the time.

152
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Okay,

153
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,220
it's efficient most of the time So and maybe this will help you guys out understand

154
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,340
a little bit more. What do we notice between realized vol and implied vol?

155
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,670
What do we notice about it? Okay, what do we notice when we look at this?

156
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,790
Okay That's the blessing things overpriced not necessarily Okay,

157
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,270
what do we notice about this graph right here? Right implied volatility,

158
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,670
which is what the market's expecting and realized volatility what actually happens?

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,350
Okay Okay, some of you guys are going off the deep end now. Okay.

160
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,140
The answer is they move together They move together.

161
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,240
The market's pretty smart volatility clusters volatility is not that hard to predict,

162
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,880
right?

163
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,380
So when we have You know as the realized vol goes up the implied vol goes up as

164
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,320
the realized vol goes down the implied vol goes down So what we just filtered for

165
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,620
if we really think about it,

166
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,620
okay We just filtered for implied volatilities high so uncertainty Okay,

167
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,080
implied vol is a lot higher than our forecast and we want to forecast has historical

168
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,820
vol priced in right?

169
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,390
and so what this is telling us we just made a filter for The market expects something

170
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,460
big to happen That's literally what we just scanned for there is some uncertainty

171
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,300
in the market.

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,570
We just built this scanner Okay If we look at all the filters and what we just filtered

173
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,480
for The market is tell all these stocks the market is telling us something is about

174
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,640
to happen Okay,

175
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,900
quick example quick example to show me PSTH Pershing square holdings.

176
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,710
I think it's good about it's gonna buy out a company.

177
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,840
It's like Something big is happening with the stock and the market is saying something

178
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,560
big is gonna happen or something not big hasn't happened It's about to happen,

179
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,730
right?

180
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:06,540
So now we have this filter where we can come in and say is this overpriced or is

181
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,300
this underpriced?

182
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,400
Right if we if we find out that Pershing square is all retail buyers Well,

183
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,620
we can almost not almost certainly but we can be a very confident in saying There's

184
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,060
probably some Extra unwanted unneeded fault unnecessary vault Pinterest GSX,

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,800
right?

186
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,680
These are a lot of these are hype stocks And but the people are telling us something

187
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,380
big is gonna happen right the market's telling us something big is gonna happen

188
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,600
and now we can filter for that and Right.

189
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,640
A lot of the money is made around uncertainty and we're just we just searched for

190
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,720
uncertainty Okay. So anyways, we're gonna take a look at silver.

191
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,000
We're gonna take a look look at silver It's right at the top of our list here And

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm just gonna you know,

193
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,720
do one quick all the way through so you guys can see arc is also here as well Okay

194
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,630
And there's just some other names for you guys arc G is there as well Okay,

195
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,630
so that's the first thing. Okay.

196
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,560
I hope some of you guys are taking notes along the way I know I know my man margins

197
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,880
taking notes along the way here So silver top of our list,

198
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,180
let's let's go through this one step at a time Stock price trading at 25 average

199
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:30,600
option volume 333,000 IV vs forecast we can see if we divide 47 by 32 We're gonna

200
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,240
get 140 point four four.

201
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,190
So implied vol is 44 percent higher than our forecast Okay implied vol is 30 90s

202
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,270
for sorry implied vol is 47 47 across realized vol is 25 Our forecast is 32 and

203
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,490
the reason why our direction forecast is 32 is because it incorporates some of this

204
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,900
implied vol in there right because remember it's always good to have implied volatility

205
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:00,480
into your model because There could be some insider information priced into that

206
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,630
implied vol right which you wouldn't get from historical data Okay,

207
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,290
so it's always good to use implied vol as well.

208
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,660
So busting out a question She's like since RV and IV move together when there's

209
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,620
separation. Is there some sort of implied uncertainty? Yes Right.

210
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,060
What what the market is telling us there is that realized vol is gonna pick up big

211
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,030
time Realize vol is gonna be a big time and it's our job to come in there and say

212
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,990
is it or is it not right?

213
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,380
It's exactly what happened to us in lit All right We said implied vol is gonna come

214
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,480
down when the market was saying realize vol is gonna go up and market was right

215
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:50,720
And that's gonna happen So IV rank 72 Okay And then skew call put ratio,

216
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,520
you know,

217
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm not gonna go through all this but that is that is silver What's looking like

218
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,480
so let's start diving in. So now we have this idea, right?

219
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,820
We have these 11 stocks So now we got to go to work.

220
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,250
Well, what do we notice first off right off the bat, right?

221
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,280
Implied vol and realized vol huge separation.

222
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,780
We're gonna get into this a little more but there's a huge separation So market

223
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,960
obviously is saying realized vol has got to go up, right?

224
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,660
Remember these are these are gonna move together So here's Nick.

225
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,400
Here's another example,

226
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,820
right if we look over here something very similar happened,

227
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,770
but guess what the market was wrong and Implied vol came down rather than realized

228
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:41,530
vol going up, right? but here's another example where The market was saying,

229
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,520
you know implied vol is gonna be 22 and then realized vol went up to like 41 Okay,

230
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,520
so Sometimes the market's right.

231
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,960
Sometimes you're right or sometimes markets wrong.

232
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,620
So right now we're in a situation where there can be a trade Right.

233
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,930
We just search for uncertainty the market saying the realized vol is gonna go up

234
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,910
but it might not and if it doesn't go up we make a lot of money and Especially knowing

235
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,850
that implied vol is usually overpriced.

236
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,350
It could be that implied vol comes down. Okay?

237
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,780
So let's take a look here guys Okay,

238
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,410
we can see green line right at the 75 mark and You know,

239
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,290
we think this could drop down to let's say it's a medium right 28 29 percent.

240
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,470
Okay, so that is So far so far. We're good.

241
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,990
We're gonna keep it going here We're gonna keep it keep it exciting.

242
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,550
Keep it fun.

243
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,270
Move on to the next stage So we know we can see right now that there is implied

244
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,250
vol is definitely high.

245
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,890
Okay implied volatility is definitely high We can see the through the volcone and

246
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,770
we can see through the implied volatility realized volatility chart And we can also

247
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,390
see that the price is rising to new highs, right?

248
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,310
We're just trying to get ideas Maybe this might be the case Maybe you know We're

249
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,230
always trying to think I was trying to think of new ways that this could possibly

250
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,170
be and we're never ever Gonna get tied to a belief Okay,

251
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,080
sometimes we believe this one thing and we say and we just try to prove that prove

252
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,260
it, right? Okay, that's not how the traders are.

253
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,060
We take a new information we adjust. Okay, so here we go Implied vol pricey.

254
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,580
That's so far. What what our conclusion is if you look at this,

255
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,110
right share price goes up vol goes up So it makes sense that we're seeing an increase

256
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,400
in implied vol when the stocks making new highs Exactly. Okay,

257
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,100
so now Sean always says how do we know what this thing is worth?

258
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,220
How do we know what the hell this thing is worth?

259
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,880
Well right off the bat we think given our forecast right here.

260
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,010
This should be be worth 32% Okay, this should be worth 32% now.

261
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,590
I want to ask you guys a tough question What else can we do to see if this is worth

262
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,570
32%? What else how else can we go and price this thing?

263
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,140
Okay, how else can we go and price this thing?

264
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:14,670
Okay, I'm gonna give you guys a hint. I'm give you guys a hint here Okay,

265
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:21,660
we see Sean right strong strong Strong Indian man half Indian man,

266
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:29,040
right you see that now now how are we gonna know and Someone comes to you and says

267
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,160
hey are all are all Indians strong.

268
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,270
I are all Indian men strong What would you do? Right,

269
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,930
how would you tell if Sean is actually strong or not compared to you know,

270
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,390
everyone else out there?

271
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,970
Maybe maybe everyone else it is way stronger and Sean is actually weak Kyle's saying

272
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,970
ask me Right ask Sean sure Stephen's got it there,

273
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,830
but Stephen's got we're gonna find more info We're gonna go find yeah,

274
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,220
we should go to India and see how everyone else is So what can we do here?

275
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,870
well we need to find other assets that are similar to SLV and now we can really

276
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,470
start pricing this thing in Absolute terms we think SLV is overpriced, right?

277
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,570
We got Divi and Ram here. Yeah, that's three for three There you go,

278
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,190
there you go,

279
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,480
right there you go so implied volatility right now is pricey Relative to our forecast.

280
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,990
Okay, so that's an absolute terms, right?

281
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,560
You see you look at Sean you look at me Sean looking pretty strong Okay,

282
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,500
so good pretty strong, but we need to see more.

283
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,470
We need to see other people who are similar to Sean Right,

284
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,420
maybe maybe Sean's not that strong in his asset class Right,

285
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,540
and so we gotta start getting some work done here.

286
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,580
So what we do is We go and look at what other stocks are they're gonna be so we

287
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,360
have this thing built into the terminals called our watch list okay,

288
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,630
and so What I did was I went on Google I looked up. Okay. Well,

289
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,230
what are similar assets to silver? Okay, and you know,

290
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,810
there weren't really good info,

291
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,650
but right off the bat from what I've known as a trader gold is pretty good Okay,

292
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,690
gold is pretty good. Maybe lithium. It's pretty similar, right?

293
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:27,920
So what I did was I added Silver, okay. I added gold. I added lithium. Okay.

294
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,300
I added S&P 500. I added real estate I saw some one article.

295
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,770
I'd said real estate's correlated We have to see we're just finding out we have

296
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:43,730
to find out we don't know right via real estate and We'll go with that. Okay.

297
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,710
So then what else I did I did IV vs forecast IV 60-day I'm trying to get some some

298
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:55,340
tabs here RV 10 RV 20-day and then I run that okay And what we get here is a correlation

299
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,760
matrix You got to take off this What we get is a correlation matrix and right off

300
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,320
the bat we can see gold and silver are 77% correlated Okay,

301
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,860
it's actually if we look across silver,

302
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:15,230
we've got 32% with lithium obviously one with silver 27% with S&P and 32% with VNQ

303
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,770
with real estate.

304
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,510
So really only looking at gold here Yeah Gold is a good one to really to really

305
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,250
compare that with right?

306
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,790
So we're looking for correlation like for our example here We're basically trying

307
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,710
to get a better forecast of what realized vol might look like What level of correlation

308
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,490
would be like adequate to at least consider for 75? 75% and above. Okay,

309
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,750
Marcus thing. How about silver miners? So we're Marcos,

310
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:43,850
you know the ETF for that one 100% because Marcos for example gold in GDX.

311
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,290
So GDX is the gold miners 100% Marcos,

312
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,160
do you have it off the top of your head real quick?

313
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,300
Okay, I'm just gonna throw a gold miners for now I'll look it up.

314
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,520
I don't know if there was one,

315
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,200
but let's see what we got here Marcos with gold miners gold miners 55% correlation

316
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,680
with silver.

317
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,300
I'm sure if the silver miners would be a lot a lot thing But you see you see how

318
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,540
you're thinking of that idea. I say L There we go, okay,

319
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:26,960
let's see here there it is Marcos boom huge Corley GDX Is it?

320
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,590
Oh slv 68 that's not bad. It's not bad. Okay, so we can still use it.

321
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,490
It's not great But it's not bad. Okay,

322
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,530
but we're thinking right PAS I think that's an actual. Yeah. Yeah,

323
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,010
I think that's an actual stock, but we'll go with it.

324
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:50,100
Anyways PAS right here So it's not the greatest not the greatest.

325
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,260
So for now we got gold is the highest we're gonna use gold.

326
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,680
Okay Marcos So you can see right here guys We're gonna filter for IV versus our

327
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,880
forecast right and what we basically see is that silver?

328
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay is the highest versus the forecast Okay,

329
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:19,550
it's the highest versus the forecast meaning that if we know that let's say a similar

330
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,550
asset, right?

331
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,930
It should have a similar IV versus forecast but this one has a much higher one right

332
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,220
much higher than gold not much higher but higher than gold I'm much higher than

333
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,640
every other asset, even though you know, they're not perfectly correlated.

334
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,340
Okay? Now this is where the real analysis kicks in. Okay.

335
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,980
So now remember we're still trying to price this thing So we found an asset that's

336
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,540
similar. Okay, it's kind of similar It's very similar.

337
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,130
So we need to go head over to the relative value and we need to start digging deeper

338
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,870
So here I populated silver and I populated gold. Okay,

339
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:04,690
and I removed the outliers in the data sets When we run it, okay well,

340
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,230
we see that the prices are pretty correlated right you guys can see that right they

341
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:14,660
move together and here is the rolling correlation if we look at 60-day chunks and

342
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,450
we see that it goes from anywhere between 86 percent and 55 percent. Okay,

343
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:25,030
so gold and silver are between over the last two years 55 percent correlated and

344
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,830
86 percent correlated Steve's asking why are we removing outliers if there's no

345
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,270
earnings or anything like that? Yeah You know,

346
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,740
it's a really good question Steve It's just because I really like to look at you

347
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,400
know The group the core right what's really happening in the middle in the middle

348
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:47,060
of the body and not really focusing on the tails too much But you know,

349
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,800
you can definitely play around with that Steve if you want to remove them go for

350
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,680
it Totally up to you.

351
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,560
So next we can see we have this number here. It's called the beta okay,

352
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:07,500
and this tells us basically if Gold went up 1% How much would silver move if gold

353
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:15,370
went down 1% how much would silver move and so silver moves? 1.299 times gold.

354
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,510
Okay.

355
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:25,370
So here's an example if gold went up 2% Silver would go up two times 1.299 and that

356
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,610
would be this blue line right here.

357
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,660
So gold would be up a silver would be up about 2.75% Okay,

358
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,320
we're a little less two point two point six percent Okay,

359
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,000
that's how much silver should be up on average.

360
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,320
And so we have a beta of 1.3 Okay,

361
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:52,840
if if gold is down 1% then silver is down one point three percent Okay,

362
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,980
so that and you can see the return so each dot is a return a silver day return for

363
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,760
each of them. Exactly Okay, so now we're getting a sense here. Okay.

364
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,850
Well Now we can really start pricing this thing Really really start pricing this

365
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:12,880
so we know that gold silver should move about 1.3 times gold.

366
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:21,140
So we come over to So if we go back to our implied vol tab here Okay,

367
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,540
sorry go back to our watch list.

368
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,370
Well if 60-day implied volatility Okay for gold is 19 and a half.

369
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:35,340
Well silver should be 1.3 times that which is about 26 It's about 26 is trading

370
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,180
at 47 and a half. Okay, that's That's extremely big. Okay,

371
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,440
that's extremely big but we got to keep digging we're not done we're not done yet

372
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,180
Okay, we got to keep digging here.

373
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,520
So we head over to head over to relative value Now we're over here at relative value.

374
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,710
Let me just take all this down. You don't want to ruin the surprise yet Okay,

375
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:05,150
head over to relative value and we need to see well what's expensive is the 30 days

376
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,110
expensive is the 60 days expensive is The 90 days expensive what what what's expensive

377
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,370
here?

378
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:15,450
And so what I usually like to do is I put the IV 30-day versus the IV 90-day I'll

379
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:25,040
take the ratio. I'll take the ratio of that and it looks about even right?

380
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,140
We're Basically at the mean here.

381
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,450
There may be a little bit cheap But we're basically, you know,

382
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,770
we're really at the mean here.

383
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:40,120
So let's let's try to maybe IV 30 or IV 90 IV 60 You know more us.

384
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,500
Yeah more or less the same thing, right? So now it's a question of okay well,

385
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,640
what do I want exposure to realize vol or implied vol and You know in this case,

386
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,330
I'm just gonna go with the IV 60-day Blend of both. Yeah, it's a blend of both,

387
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,330
you know, you can do the 45s I think you know,

388
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,500
I think that's a pretty good pretty good Place to be at so we're gonna go with the

389
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:08,950
IV 60 days So what we're gonna do is we're gonna compare IV 60-day versus its realized

390
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,330
volatility Okay, it's the first thing we're gonna do. So look at this guys.

391
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,050
We're at all-time highs We're at all-time highs of implied vol versus the realized

392
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,140
volatility Okay Pretty expensive, but let's go and plot gold against that.

393
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,710
So in absolute terms This looks pretty expensive The absolute terms is actually

394
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:40,240
extremely expensive. Let's go and plot Gold IV 60-day versus RV 20-day.

395
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,390
Okay, and you guys are gonna notice something pretty cool.

396
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:55,560
Okay We notice it's actually maybe not that expensive Take a look. Okay,

397
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,120
take a look here.

398
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:03,190
The blue is silver Okay implied vol over realized vol and the green line is gold

399
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:10,390
implied vol over realized vol and what we see is Okay They're pretty much matched

400
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,770
right now. Well, they pretty much match up in general right now.

401
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,050
It's a bit pricey Okay, silver is a bit pricey,

402
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,860
but it might not be as pricey as we thought it was in the first round Okay,

403
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,020
so it's still pricey. Don't don't get me wrong. We're still up here, right?

404
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,340
We're still at the top of the range here Still pricey,

405
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,820
but it might not be a no-brainer if we saw let's say gold down here at 1.45 and

406
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,820
this was at 1.85. Well,

407
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,550
maybe this looks like a little bit of a no-brainer But you know,

408
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,230
it might be expensive for a reason.

409
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,800
So Danny saying they're still moving together. Yep. So, you know,

410
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,520
this is basically We're pricing the implied vol of gold Versus realized vol which

411
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,540
is the green line here Okay,

412
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,720
so this is the implied vol versus the realized vol for gold and then this is the

413
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,780
implied vol Realized vol for silver and they should move together Right.

414
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,610
Here's an example There's gonna be a big there's gonna be a big inflation period.

415
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:22,370
Let's say okay or someone's about to win the election and one one of the members

416
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,050
you know is if they get in they get If they get in charge,

417
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,470
they're going to you know,

418
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,470
increase inflation like crazy They're gonna print money like crazy and then so,

419
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,430
you know And on the other side the other party is gonna do the opposite.

420
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:42,570
So you got a lot of uncertainty and let's say in metals And so you're gonna see

421
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,090
that uncertainty in gold and you're gonna see that uncertainty in silver,

422
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,360
right?

423
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,160
So these vols should move together and they're implied to realize vols should move

424
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,300
together as well Right, but when they diverge You might say okay. Well,

425
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,550
this one's a little pricey Right.

426
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,350
This one's getting a little pricey relative to the rest of the assets that are similar

427
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,890
to it, right? So So Eric's asking, you know,

428
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,510
it's more so we're saying is it more inclined for RV to come up versus IV coming

429
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,250
down? So it doesn't necessarily right,

430
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,330
we're just saying it's like It's not like we're seeing low IV everywhere and like

431
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,690
this one's caught a bid for some reason and it's like wow These things move relative

432
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,240
to one another and this one never caught a bid but this one caught a bid What we're

433
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,400
saying is they all caught a bid. Maybe there's something happening.

434
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:40,310
You know what I mean? Right, and so, you know for that reason something,

435
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,690
you know, it might be overpriced.

436
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,990
It might not be underpriced It's our job as a trader to figure this one out.

437
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,950
Mm-hmm Right,

438
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,130
it's not as clear-cut as it initially appeared when we just had this one plotted

439
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,040
right? We look here or the blue one Oh, yeah, so I have the gold there.

440
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,960
Yeah when we have SLV plotted like this looks like a no-brainer, right?

441
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,070
Let's draw a nice little line here Yeah,

442
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:14,120
look at this Right looks like a no-brainer But then we look at it relative to gold

443
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,220
and we're like, oh wait Maybe maybe there's a reason right?

444
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,510
Maybe it's not just a no-brainer because golds also golds implied to realize it's

445
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,090
also pricey So something is gonna happen.

446
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,310
It looks like in the metal space Right some some some there's gonna be some event

447
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,980
coming up which could be tomorrow's event But there's gonna be something coming

448
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,400
up that's gonna cause realize vault to increase But then if we look at it,

449
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,580
let's go back to something quick if we look at the term structure for it,

450
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,840
though It's pretty flat. It's just flat across the top strange. Good point,

451
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,280
right? So so now here's another level of our analysis.

452
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,790
Maybe there's no event Because When you see an event, right?

453
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,490
If we go to let's say and you and you right and you has earnings coming up in two

454
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,820
days We look at the term structure Look at this the implied vols way up here and

455
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,900
then it drops it lets us know there's an event here or let's look at one that has

456
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,280
an event like a little bit further out like BA has one in like a month.

457
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,270
Nothing really pricing. We'll try Tesla and that's it.

458
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:28,870
If you look at Tesla I think there's come up to but right check this out.

459
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:36,600
We can see that the implied volatility Increases up to 60 days and we have this

460
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,100
event here,

461
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,320
right somewhere in here We have like they're implying a lot of volatility,

462
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,070
but when we go back to SLV We can't seem to isolate any single event.

463
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,830
Like there's no time day that there or you know Timeframe where they're saying there's

464
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,090
an event.

465
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:57,630
They're just saying vol is gonna be high and you guys can see like We look at realized

466
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,370
all here implied vault across the board is very pricey relative to how much this

467
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:07,500
thing actually moves So let's get the check. Okay,

468
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,340
so Marco's saying can you check out copper? Marco's ETF real quick for that.

469
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,640
Yeah,

470
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,800
you can send the ticker So here we are relative value now We also just quickly I

471
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,680
was just thinking about we're going through this For the guys that are coming into

472
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,420
the morning lives if you want us to do more stuff like this We can do breakdowns

473
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,160
like this on the morning lives.

474
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,620
I would just need some of your help I just get the tickers quick.

475
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:37,330
So I'm not spending the whole time trying to find something to compare it to Okay

476
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,990
So even if we if we price implied volatility 60 for silver and implied volatility

477
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:47,770
60 for gold We do a division of that right to see what is implied vol relative to

478
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,200
gold pricey The answer is not really a little bit. Yeah, sure. It's pricey.

479
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,730
Sure. It's in the pricey range, but it's not like what wild Yeah, right.

480
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,800
So we're digging deeper into this thing and So far conclusion is silver is expensive

481
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,990
fall is expensive. No doubt about it, right? Especially in absolute terms,

482
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,950
but how expensive it doesn't look like it's a crazy expensive.

483
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,740
It just looks overpriced Okay,

484
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:19,480
so we can't go in with huge size and that's incorporating into our Into our the

485
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,730
amount we're gonna trade here. Okay.

486
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,290
So Marcos is saying we got a couple right here.

487
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,290
Thank you Marcos and Ram as well Let's go back to the Into this super quick guys.

488
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,470
We might not have all of them, but we'll give it a shot here.

489
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,460
Okay, no JJ Cop X. Are you sure? That's the one?

490
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,320
No,

491
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:49,260
we don't have the Marcos tell me now just like copper this they're too cheap Don't

492
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,740
have those you are a let's see No, okay soon soon soon soon.

493
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,380
Yeah guys ticker soon. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah Okay.

494
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,370
So now we know that this thing is a little bit pricey And we come to the conclusion.

495
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,910
Okay, then we got to see. Okay. Well what's happening here, right?

496
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:11,320
you know when you go on the news and We can go do something like silver seeking

497
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,480
Alpha, okay,

498
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:20,160
and right off the bat we got a article here December 9th and Here we can read this

499
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,080
article from this guy. Okay, and he's gonna be you know, a pretty good article,

500
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,600
right? We can read this we can get a lot of insight what's going on here.

501
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,900
What's going to do this guy's head, right?

502
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,380
You know sure using technical technical analysis,

503
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,420
but he's trading silver like a lot of these guys at seeking Alpha They actually

504
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,310
trade their product. Okay Here we go. Best silver mining stock.

505
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,130
Let's read this thing.

506
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,450
Let's really get inside of the hedge Who's buying this stuff?

507
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,050
I'm gonna sell it wonder who's buying this.

508
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,870
So we start reading the stuff and You know,

509
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:57,340
we can even go on stock twits and see what the hell's going on here and Like look

510
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,160
at this guys. We don't even see crazy. Hype. We're not even seeing crazy.

511
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,340
Hype on this stock, right?

512
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,260
So right off the bat originally super bullish super bullish,

513
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,860
but the message volumes not through the roof.

514
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's like average So right off the bat we went from like this is a no-brainer trade.

515
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,480
We're digging deeper. We're digging deeper And now it's just a mediocre trade,

516
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,050
right? But at the end of the day,

517
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:24,000
we usually have to have a position on We usually should at least maybe I shouldn't

518
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,460
say that. So I have some capital deployed.

519
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,240
We should have some capital deployed And it's not like this is a bad trade,

520
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,520
right?

521
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,240
So if it happens to be the best trade you maybe slap some on right and you guys

522
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,140
always remember There's not always a good trade right the market for the most part

523
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,200
is efficient. You have to always remember that There's not always a trade.

524
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:53,960
Mm-hmm Open up thinkorswim and now so we let's say we decide okay silver is pricey

525
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,780
Right, I think all those can come to the conclusion.

526
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,260
That is a little pricey This is we want to trade it.

527
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,470
I can't go on stock puts on the lives. Really? My computer explodes Okay,

528
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:17,760
if Lynn had paid off I was gonna buy a new computer And guys for homework do this

529
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,660
on arc do the same analysis.

530
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,460
We'll upload live right after this mark I hope you're on live will upload it right

531
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,400
after Do the same analysis as homework on arc and I want you guys to come to your

532
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,420
own conclusion Also share it in the group.

533
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,620
Yeah share in the group and make sure Make sure you look at the amount the sentiment

534
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,520
analysis. Okay,

535
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,600
make sure you look at what is happening What are people saying about this seeking

536
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,720
alpha stock puts read the news really try to understand who the hell is my customer?

537
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,450
Right. That's probably what 99% of traders don't do and you know,

538
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,670
they just think it's breaking out.

539
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,970
I'm gonna buy Right choose your customer here really think about it.

540
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,450
All right. So here we go February 26 46 days out. I like it. We're gonna go.

541
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,070
Let's say We want to be short Vega. Okay. So in this case scenario,

542
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,070
I'm probably gonna because silver isn't gonna have buyout potential It's not gonna

543
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,070
have bankruptcy potential.

544
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:12,570
I I would prefer to go naked on this And just have a really good stop-loss here.

545
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,850
So in this case, let's say I'm doing the Delta 40 strangle.

546
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:25,440
Okay These are like my Delta 40 strangles. Here we go 24 50 27 Okay,

547
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,980
so here we are.

548
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,430
Okay,

549
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,870
here's the trade now We look at my risk if I just showed Sean my risk and said we're

550
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:44,550
short 70 Vega long 36 Theta short 176 gamma and long basically zero Delta 20 Deltas

551
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:52,730
or short 20 Deltas Sean would say I Would say why I got so much gamma It's a short

552
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,610
fall Right.

553
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:00,760
We're definitely short convexity here and we short volatility not good one Grady

554
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,900
And so now the next step would be okay, well if we're right Okay,

555
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,370
if we're right in this scenario, what should happen? Okay. Well,

556
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,030
we can use kind of the gold reference to see Okay. Well, where should this go?

557
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:15,290
Right?

558
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:31,280
So let's um So you

559
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
have to get a sense of okay, well,

560
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,320
where should this be priced at right and We can use a couple things here.

561
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:42,980
One thing we can use is the volatility Volcom where's implied ball gonna go after

562
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,760
the event after those things all over right and we could see well the 60-day It's

563
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,560
probably gonna come below the 75, right? It's probably gonna come,

564
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,310
you know in somewhere between 27 and 42 Okay,

565
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,810
that's our first that's our first area of looking at right between somewhere between

566
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:02,870
27 and 42 and we can look at gold Right and look at the relationship between gold

567
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:11,980
and silver right Or sorry realize volume implied ball, right?

568
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,600
So we can look at gold right and look at the relationship between Okay, well,

569
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,040
you know, it's probably gonna meet in the middle somewhere, right?

570
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:26,160
So 47 plus 25 is 75 let's call it 65 divided by 2. Oh, sorry. Yes. Yeah. Yeah,

571
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,100
let's call it 35 and a half Okay, 735 and a half.

572
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,240
So there's if these were to meet in the middle, right?

573
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,280
We're gonna get somewhere 35 35 looks like it's inside our range here No,

574
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,600
this is probably a good place to start right if we're right ball is probably gonna

575
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:49,870
come down from 47 to 35 Okay, so Let's head back over to think or swim.

576
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,550
And of course guys you can do more analysis here You know getting more stocks in

577
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,470
your analysis to try to price this thing.

578
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,850
You'll get a better sense of okay What's gonna happen here, right?

579
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,850
Example for our lit I was we were pretty certain that vol is gonna drop down to

580
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,050
40 or sorry 35, right?

581
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:11,440
So The more data you get the more the more work you put into it the better analysis

582
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,010
you can do So here we are.

583
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:21,470
So if we're right vol should drop to 35 to 12 points Do 10 points more like you'd

584
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:28,670
be 37. Okay 10 points. So here we go. Okay, so this is where You know,

585
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,070
this is where we should this is what our profit should look like if we're right

586
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,770
now Every good trader doesn't just think about if one of their right they always

587
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:41,510
think about when they're wrong Okay, so if we look back here Okay,

588
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:45,550
if we're wrong, I we could probably see because you know,

589
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,550
we could probably could potentially see you know Back to these levels here.

590
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,890
Let's say 65, but we also want to say well, when are we wrong?

591
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,940
when are we gonna get out of the position and in in this case scenario,

592
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,420
I would get out when implied vol and realized vol connect right or Collapse that

593
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,900
implied versus realized collapses. And so, you know,

594
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,000
we only have 10 minutes here We're not gonna go too deep into it.

595
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:17,560
But let's say we get out at around 50% implied volatility. Okay,

596
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,340
that's more wrong.

597
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,860
That's when we're out of the position And we're going to move on just like what

598
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,900
happened with lit right?

599
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:30,690
We sold it at 45 all it's not really a 48 vol and We're wrong you're wrong we got

600
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:46,040
out so let's price down here plus 3% 5% and

601
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:53,570
Let's say we stress it to a 10% move on either side So now we can see relatively,

602
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,010
you know an idea We certainly can start getting an idea of where our risk is right

603
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,610
how much we're gonna lose if we're wrong So in this position,

604
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,640
we're probably gonna lose about 800 bucks All right. So now we say okay. Well,

605
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,520
here we go. We have a structure.

606
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,860
We understand our risks we know what we're gonna be wrong,

607
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,520
we know when we're gonna be right and Now let's throw it.

608
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,640
Let's slap it on Right,

609
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,280
and let's see what happens and let's re-evaluate every single day or every single

610
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,610
minute when new information comes in It's asking so, how do we get out?

611
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,010
We would actually just straight-up close the position Yes,

612
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,490
right We're not really a big fan of you know Trying to band-aid positions trying

613
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,990
to save positions trying to get back some of the money We make the best trades we

614
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,800
can When we're right, we're right when we're wrong,

615
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,920
we're wrong and we just own it and find the next trade I would even say we're actually

616
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,250
anti band-aiding Yeah bandaging bandaging. We're anti bandaging. Okay,

617
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,920
if you're wrong You get out of the position Okay,

618
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,720
and that's gonna make you guys much much better traders. Okay,

619
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,230
you know And we would close the whole position As a rule of thumb you'd close the

620
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,810
whole position. Yes, not just one leg.

621
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:06,570
We wouldn't close a losing leg We're gonna roll one of the legs out We're wrong,

622
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,340
right and that's a tough thing that we have to take it on as traders and you know

623
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,580
a lot of time people say we'll get into this position and then you know roll one

624
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:21,900
leg to Roll the defending leg or the attacking leg, whatever it is.

625
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,580
You're just trying to keep this position alive.

626
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,980
That's not going good for you Are you trying to get back now in hope in hope mode

627
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,780
I don't want to be in that mode and sometimes it does pay off, right?

628
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,400
Yeah sometimes it doesn't but your capital is being tied up to something that usually

629
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,150
usually and I know you guys can some of you can really Really feel with this one

630
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,770
is that you put on a trade it goes against you You bandage it up and then as soon

631
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,890
as it becomes break-even you get out of the position, right?

632
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:58,630
That's not that's not that's not what trading is We have an idea we take advantage

633
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,450
of the idea we place a trade and if we're wrong, that's okay, right?

634
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,820
The market's smart and that's really okay guys But in the long run we have to become

635
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,060
we have to come out winners And all that means is we're gonna be writing more often,

636
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,300
right?

637
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,820
Especially if we're short of all we're gonna be right more often right and our winners

638
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:19,180
our losers are not gonna cripple us We're not gonna bandage bandage bandage,

639
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,440
you know, next thing, you know,

640
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:30,260
the room's still open We get crushed we get a scrape we throw some Throw some ointment

641
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,020
on it. We get back out there.

642
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,140
You pour a bit of our whiskey on it And we we keep going we get back out there.

643
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,660
