1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,400
Okay guys, so in this live, we're actually gonna be looking at a pre-release.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,080
So what is a pre-release, right?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,440
And remember this week we're talking about unique opportunities, right?

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,520
So Opportunities that don't happen all the time. It's not systematic, right?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,780
An algo can't capture it You know a systematic trader can't capture it.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,880
It's something that's unique, right?

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,240
Merger and acquisition unique Pre-releases so pre-release is basically an earning

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,950
a stock comes out before the earnings event and says Here here's my numbers Here

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,660
are my numbers. Here's here are most of my numbers Going into the event.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,080
So I'm gonna announce it before the event.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm gonna issue a press release Okay.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,680
Now the beauty of this is that Not always vol drops or vol changes.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,830
Imagine this guys what drives the stock around earnings event? It's the news.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,960
It's the new information hitting the market So if This news already comes out pre

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,390
prior to the the the event Then you would expect once the news is out volatility

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,590
should drop but sometimes the news comes out and volatility doesn't change So that's

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,170
what we're actually gonna look at today and we're gonna use all the software all

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,250
the technology that we have available to us To go over it. Okay,

19
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:43,180
so So what I did guys I'm gonna share my screen Hold on one second guys Okay

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,930
Okay, so Okay, guys,

21
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:00,230
so what I did was I searched for the next upcoming earnings of the upcoming next

22
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:06,280
upcoming Earnings dates for different companies that are on the list and one of

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,760
the companies was PPG. Okay, so there's this function in Bloomberg. Okay,

24
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,560
it's called guide.

25
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:29,320
This is a really good one from Bloomberg okay,

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,550
so There's a function in Bloomberg called guide and what it does basically is it

27
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,210
tells you?

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:47,670
when a company it tells you when a company releases its Events when it tells you

29
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,210
basically when does a company talk about its earnings? Okay.

30
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,580
So for example this company had earnings on Let's say let's look at last year.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,780
So PPG last year had earnings 1017 and they did a four-year guidance Okay of revenue.

32
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,800
They dropped their guidance for revenue Okay,

33
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,440
so they said we continue to expect full year sales growth to come down And they

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,100
also said they're for full year So full year meaning the next year the guidance

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,160
for that in that year. Okay,

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,450
that's what drives a lot of the vol We are going to adjust our our earnings.

37
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,980
We're going to adjust that down So Bloomberg actually sorts that out for you and

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,120
you know, you can see what's going on Okay,

39
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,820
so PPG has earnings coming up next week next week on Monday,

40
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,520
I believe Monday or Tuesday of next week.

41
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:48,010
Now what happened was on October 8th They came out and said PPG projects strong

42
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,290
third quarter financial Guidance, okay, and they explained so if we you know,

43
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,880
we can click on the article and it'll bring us to the article here Okay,

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,540
we're basically they're saying that the revenue is going to increase by 5% And their

45
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,560
earnings per share is going to be in the range between $1.90 and $1.94.

46
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:15,190
So they have just given out information One week before their earnings event.

47
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,750
So not much is going to change between that event, right?

48
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,530
Now they didn't give up. They didn't they didn't give full year guidance Okay,

49
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,280
but they did give us the earnings numbers for this quarter Okay within a tight range

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,670
190 and 194 so volatility is gonna be Dropped a lot.

51
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,990
Okay Now we actually don't have Bloomberg, right? You know the guys on here.

52
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,330
We don't have Bloomberg. So what can we do? Well, we have on the new terminal.

53
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,570
Okay on the new terminal we can go to News and sentiment. Okay,

54
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:59,500
so we type in PPG at the top and right here you can see on October 10th October

55
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,620
8th, sorry PPG projects strong third quarter financial results,

56
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,950
right and they it basically summarizes The upcoming quarter. Okay,

57
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,470
they basically gave you a gave us an example of what we should expect.

58
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,180
The earnings was pre-released now another thing that we have here,

59
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:26,260
which Bloomberg doesn't have is we have access to The implied move.

60
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,470
So how did this affect? With all how did this affect the earnings event?

61
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,810
So just the earnings ball. Yeah,

62
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,010
this is the earnings isolated This is isolated earnings volatility. Yeah,

63
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,070
this is just the implied move.

64
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,050
This is just the implied move over the last year Okay,

65
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,670
so you can see guys right so October 7th It went from four point three five the

66
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,600
implied move four point three five percent Down to three point three nine percent

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,520
on so once the information was released vol dropped Okay,

68
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,650
but guess what it picked right back up Okay.

69
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,590
So now we're in a situation where it was almost as if the news was never released

70
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,070
Right volatility should have come down.

71
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,510
Let's say You know probably down to three percent right from four and a half to

72
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,000
three percent and now it's all the way back up Right.

73
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,620
So this is a situation we can take advantage of now by selling ball around this

74
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,200
earnings announcement We should not see this stock move, right?

75
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,860
One thing that you know They could come out and say is we are gonna have a crazy

76
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,740
full year guidance now that would move the stock But remember guys we have more

77
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,080
information now Volatility should be less Right.

78
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,440
Let me ask you guys this question. Would you rather sell vol?

79
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,040
Knowing this quarters earnings or not knowing this quarters earnings Right,

80
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,160
we obviously wanted to sell vol. Well,

81
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,860
we obviously prefer the more information So we're getting the information but the

82
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,560
vol is not dropping here and you can actually see guys Volatility is still higher

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,240
than when it was pre COVID.

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,160
So not only do we basically have all the information we don't have we also have

85
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:21,310
Implied move still bid so check this out guys Let's go Okay,

86
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,970
so you can see last quarter. For example,

87
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,650
they announced on October 17 and prior to that they had their their last quarter

88
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,260
earnings But there was nothing in between This quarter. Look at this guys.

89
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:40,400
This is a one-time situation where they are releasing information to us Right before

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,780
the event and what was the move for that event the actual move to want to look up

91
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,960
on our terminal? Which one?

92
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,640
For this one where they released information before as well, right? No, no,

93
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,000
they previously yet. Have they pre released before? No, no, no, they have not.

94
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,440
Okay. I thought it was there. Yeah, so Right. Oh, hold on this over here.

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,740
Okay,

96
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,720
they did something similar here actually Let's go take a look at what happened.

97
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,860
So this was the the 10 18 2018. Okay,

98
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,920
so let's take a look guys You go to historical moves.

99
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,400
Okay, we go to 2018 10 right here guys.

100
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,330
Look at that 2018 10 here was the move 1.25% Is overstated as well as that 2.8 and

101
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,350
I'm moving 1.25, right? So,

102
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,710
you know that probably came that probably wasn't even the jump that was probably

103
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,310
an intraday move, right? So,

104
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,150
you know here is an advantage we can take we can we can we have an advantage here

105
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,030
Markets not repricing because it's a one-time thing Right because of this one-time

106
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,410
thing it did reprice probably didn't reprice enough It did reprice but we can come

107
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,050
in over the top.

108
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,560
Okay?

109
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,540
Yeah, you like that Neil 20 quarters. You know,

110
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,600
you we had a 2018 number in here.

111
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,110
What this is 2018 See me 2016 Fuck oh, yeah. No. No, look. Oh,

112
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:23,020
what the fuck is gonna have it sorted by month by accident Guys beta beta Very cool

113
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,380
as well. How would you have done if you bought calls?

114
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,570
How would you have done if you just bought puts? So how do you like that guys?

115
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,620
Yeah, and so You know,

116
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,220
we're we're working away on the terminal I'm gonna come out and you guys can even

117
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,500
see like how IV changed every time So on this date,

118
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,810
for example implied volatility the day before went from 25 to 18 Okay,

119
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,580
and there's gonna be more stuff coming guys. This is just a little teaser Okay,

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,350
there's gonna be a lot more stuff coming so That is one certain scenario.

121
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,760
I wanted to show you guys another scenario Where this happened a while ago.

122
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,960
Okay, so I took this trade it was on VR NT Mm-hmm,

123
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,180
and they released this is like maybe two a year and a half ago.

124
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:19,500
They released a full-blown report prior to the event Okay full-blown report about

125
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,740
everything You wait,

126
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,840
so let's slow down perhaps like how can we use that information for that last trade?

127
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:33,820
You can solve all right thing about it for now you You have more information thing

128
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,460
will this print up? Okay,

129
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,200
you're in a scenario where you don't know what's gonna happen You don't know information

130
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,760
and you want to sell vol Implied move is greater than the average move. Okay?

131
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,760
now You know, you're happy selling that ball. Now.

132
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Imagine I told you Pranav these guys already released their numbers an Implied move

133
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,740
didn't change. Would you be more confident or less confident selling that ball?

134
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Yeah, we can be more certain in our in our bet. Right,

135
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,000
right You can be more certain you can you know,

136
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,850
even if the implied move is let's say near the average You can say well,

137
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,510
I still think this is overpriced. Yeah,

138
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,110
Neil it or Pranav that doesn't mean you take five lots Okay. Yeah, right.

139
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,340
That doesn't mean that the company doesn't come out and say Full full your guidance

140
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,400
is gonna be this now there are situations where that does happen and it's you as

141
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,140
a trader You know, these are one-off situations that actually happen.

142
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,630
I'm gonna say 50 times during the season Okay,

143
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,250
you guys got to find these right and I don't know if Pulumi's on the event. No,

144
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:48,500
I don't think he's here Pull it up No, no, no Lumi.

145
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,300
So Pulumi and I about a year and a half ago This is all we did.

146
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,280
All we did was look for companies every single day Companies that would pre-release

147
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,360
just sell ball sell ball sell ball sell ball. It was good.

148
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,300
It was great It's a it's a very good thing.

149
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,560
One issue is I'm sure you guys can already know this it's time-consuming It's really

150
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,660
really time-consuming So, you know, I've moved into other things Got,

151
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,960
you know found other strategies that were less time-consuming similar Similar payout

152
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,950
so I moved into those right but these are strategies that come to Every time if

153
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,090
someone in the group said hey this pre-release I'm always selling ball there There's

154
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,030
not one situation where I'm not selling ball, right? You know,

155
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,210
they're not they're not always winners Fortunately,

156
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,230
I haven't had a losing one doing this but you know, the risk is still there.

157
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,840
So you can't go you can't go too wild Mmm Andrea so how do I look for this?

158
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,620
I literally went through each individual name prior to this live on the earnings

159
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,650
calendar and said and looked at every single one Until I went like this,

160
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,530
for example, I went like this.

161
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,050
I went to the guide function. I went Apple,

162
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,640
right? Oh, no release. Okay, I did I did Amazon.

163
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,950
Okay, no release next Okay. Oh shit.

164
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,450
Yeah so that you can see that's time-consuming Right,

165
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,870
you can see it's very time-consuming imagine doing that in the terminal right you

166
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,220
do right imagine we do that in the terminal Oh,

167
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:45,510
they're gonna see the lag Right imagine did that a terminal imagine I did Apple

168
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:51,020
right and then I did okay nothing there and they did Amazon Kyle's asking is the

169
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,640
terminal news Bloomberg News It's not it's not Bloomberg News,

170
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,460
but it is a very good. It is very good provider Yeah,

171
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,540
well the press releases like you can think about this is all stuff on their website

172
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,780
Yeah. Oh, yeah, the press releases are just from the website.

173
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,000
So it is this is what Bloomberg has Yeah,

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:17,280
it's the exact same as Bloomberg same thing as Bloomberg So that is That is basically

175
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,440
these one-off trades where you can,

176
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,180
you know You can look for these things these pre releases and pack on some heat.

177
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,000
So let's take a second here to talk about Remember,

178
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,820
so this is about capturing these one-off opportunities,

179
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,440
too So the average trader looks at this and what do you think the average trader

180
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,820
thinks when they says other people trading earnings around PBG Maybe they're buying

181
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,460
a call buying a put right?

182
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,040
What do you think going through their head when they see news like that?

183
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,830
Well a lot of the time they would say Wow PPBG Increased revenue.

184
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,290
I'm gonna be buying the call into earnings because they're gonna announce that they

185
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,350
prove beat revenue. That's probably one, right? Yeah,

186
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,520
exactly or Maybe they don't really care Right,

187
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,760
maybe maybe they're still looking at how the price actions moving around this How

188
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,940
did how did the market react on the chart? Gotcha? Yeah,

189
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,540
so like okay So like for example,

190
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,100
someone might see a break out on PPG pre earnings and be like I'm gonna buy a call

191
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,550
Meanwhile someone like us will be like this vol is way overpriced news is already

192
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,970
in So the reason I bring this up guys is remember Remember the same things we said

193
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,710
over the last couple.

194
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,660
This is the power of knowing your product Knowing how volatility moves and what

195
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,060
drives high volatility low volatility how volatility should react to different types

196
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,100
of information coming out How it reacts around earnings events?

197
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,740
this is the power of knowing this stuff because the average person will see the

198
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,260
exact same thing as you and Make the different decision and more times than not

199
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,700
the wrong decision Whereas you you know,

200
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,760
especially the guys in like silver now who are thinking about risk exposure and

201
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,640
all of this type of stuff You come in and you think about how should this option

202
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,780
be changing? Relative to the information that's provided,

203
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,690
right?

204
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,260
So see this is so this is the thing of it's not just enough to see the information

205
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,400
We got to know what to do about it, right?

206
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,500
And this is over the last four weeks all these lives kind of coming together to

207
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,670
make a really good trade here.

208
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:32,860
Yeah Right and then you can see for example,

209
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,620
like how does How is the implied move reacting right?

210
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,780
How is this earnings vol reacting to this event, right?

211
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,300
If you imagine guys about in Tesla came out and said hey guys,

212
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,940
we're gonna have a pre-release and they pre-release their earnings Vol is still

213
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,180
gonna say so bid Going into that event and you as a trader can be like, okay.

214
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,360
Well,

215
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,390
look at this right implied move hasn't changed It's way higher than usual and information

216
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,570
is already out. I got to be selling vol here.

217
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,520
Okay And this is this this is you having an informational advantage Right,

218
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,120
you're having informational advantage here and I truly believe we are probably the

219
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,720
smartest earning group out there Okay, so The more information we have around,

220
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,410
you know, an earnings event is basically an information event Right,

221
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,400
that's all it is who has the most information to make the best decision Right.

222
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,860
The stock is reacting off of this brand new information coming into the market So

223
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,960
we need to be as most informed as possible at least more informed than the average

224
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:48,090
person we need to size appropriately Okay So yeah, Kyle's a good question.

225
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,490
Why would the implied move not reflect the pre-released information?

226
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,440
It's not like it's a secret. That's right. It's not a secret.

227
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,060
It's not publicized either Right. So how many people are looking at this?

228
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,660
Right. How many people are looking at this?

229
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,380
I don't know anyone in this field who does this Think about how capacity constraint

230
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,080
this is what like what's PPG?

231
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:18,160
10,000 3,000 options traded a day 5,000 options traded a day Right.

232
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,900
This thing is no one That I know is looking for press releases.

233
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,140
They are usually systematic vol traders Right.

234
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Look at all the earnings guys you see on Twitter cop.

235
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,980
How many of them are looking at this? Right,

236
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,900
and this is a market So if the if big money's not flowing behind this right and

237
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,560
the average guy is not flowing behind this sure it repriced It did reprice right

238
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,780
just like when we looked at yesterday with US. Oh,

239
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:54,080
it did reprice Let's go back to PPG Hey guys One thing that I have to finish fix

240
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,480
with this terminal is lag time.

241
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,810
So that's one thing I'm having a really hard time with is the speed Okay So unfortunately,

242
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,930
but that's what that's why it's not out right now Yeah,

243
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,400
we need to fix that because we want to port everything over to this So we want it

244
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,160
to be up and running for you guys.

245
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,660
We're aiming for next week like early next week Sorry for the delay guys,

246
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,160
but you're used to that by now, you know, we always a couple days,

247
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,220
you know Give us a couple more So Kyle, it did reprice it went from 439 to 339.

248
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,180
It dropped a 1% implied move number,

249
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:32,020
but now it's back up Right back up to 4 now so You know,

250
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,880
it probably first off it probably didn't reprice enough, right?

251
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,720
This should this should have dropped to probably 2.5 percent,

252
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,980
but there's still gonna be a risk premium baked in It's like this new cop.

253
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,500
It's like this if if I'm a hedge fund manager and I own PPG and I have to hedge

254
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,200
my shares Whether earnings is coming up whether I know about this information or

255
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,540
not. I'm still gonna be buying protection, right?

256
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,530
So there's systematic reasons that you know,

257
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,340
it won't go down or structural reasons that it won't go all the way down Right.

258
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,780
So this is you, you know,

259
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,280
even though you know people know about this It's still not gonna drop all the way

260
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,040
right and imagine this Kyle imagine Apple came out and said here are our numbers

261
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,420
and they still gonna have the earnings college So look so we have all the information

262
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,680
coming up the next day.

263
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,330
Let's say a week down the road Would it make sense that there's no implied move

264
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,920
baked in? How much do you think the implied move would be?

265
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,320
I bet you would still be high People are still gonna be buying the options hoping

266
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,520
for a good earnings call People are still gonna be buying protection in case of

267
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,470
a one-time, you know A one-time, you know,

268
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,040
the the CEO breaks down on a conference call They're still gonna be buying protection

269
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,170
for that people are still gonna be taking bets. Sure.

270
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,200
It might not be as high Because maybe the market makers are more willing to sell

271
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,780
vol But at the same time this is another systematic thing where a market maker is

272
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,260
gonna sell vol And he's not a market maker is not gonna be look it's just gonna

273
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,520
be his computer selling vol right or providing liquidity The computer is not reading

274
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,180
the prospectus or it's not reading, you know,

275
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,300
what's What's happening with this with this out with this? news release Right.

276
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,160
It's probably pricing it based on average moves based on current demand.

277
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,550
So the amount of money flowing into this Because of that article is very little

278
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,460
relative to all the other money Steven I don't think so.

279
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,660
Not that I've seen I've never seen a company that pre-releases all the time There

280
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,080
are companies that offer that release Monthly revenue statements like target.

281
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
I go to target here.

282
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,160
Okay, maybe it's not target.

283
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:17,630
I saw one maybe Oh Walmart does it?

284
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,640
Okay,

285
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,480
there are retail companies that release monthly revenue statements store sales statements.

286
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,090
That's that's You know,

287
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:36,540
that's nothing special So Marcos is asking what to do when there's no confirmed

288
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,680
date There's a whole other field of stuff you can do in that. Yeah,

289
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,070
right you can bet on the date When is the date gonna be?

290
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
Think about that one Marcos try to come up with an idea of how you could figure

291
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
that out Yeah, and some of the guys are actually trying to do that.

292
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,280
I should just go off a call with Neil prior to this You showed me some stuff.

293
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,470
So try and come up with some ideas.

294
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:05,370
Remember creativity guys trying to flex it a bit and Let's uh,

295
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,970
let's chat about it when you come up with some ideas,

296
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:13,450
you know saying eBay Okay, so guys look at this.

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,850
There's there's different forms of this that can happen, right?

319
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,620
It's like remember guys like take this and think about it,

320
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,620
right think about other things like this, right?

321
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,780
So remember we're looking at Costco and we thought that in their July Earnings that

322
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,080
they had given their year guidance,

323
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,740
but then they were saying they were gonna give their your guidance again in December

324
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,820
Mm-hmm.

325
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,420
It's like they've already given it Everyone's pricing in that they're gonna give

326
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,700
their your guidance in December,

327
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:55,700
but they gave it in July So what the fuck right like these are the kind of opportunities

328
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:02,310
that are one-offs big money Or easy money, you know or reliable money.

329
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,790
It is maybe a better way to put it. It's low-hanging fruit. Mm-hmm Right,

330
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,810
but then you gotta be careful low-hanging fruit as well. Yeah,

331
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,470
so maybe poison Yeah, you know still by the wings just know that you know,

332
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,850
you should be going with a little more confidence Mm-hmm,

333
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,770
like treat the same but it's a good trait,

334
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:23,380
right and you can go with confidence. Yeah and a little more size Okay,

335
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,760
so you guys have any questions about that? Now the one thing though,

336
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,180
it's tedious, right? It is tedious. How many of these are there?

337
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,260
There's lots No, there's probably 50 every quarter.

338
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,670
So cows saying they released pre so, let's see.

339
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,650
I don't see it. No Kyle Don't see it.

340
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,260
No preliminary third-quarter revenue.

341
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,660
I'm not I'm not seeing anything regarding I'm not seeing anything regarding information

342
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,660
prior to the event No, I think today's release. Yeah,

343
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,580
they gave out future revenue numbers like Basic numbers of the future. Yeah,

344
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,340
here's all the here's all the numbers they gave out, right?

345
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,230
Here's all the numbers that they gave out today But imagine Kyle they gave these

346
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:39,890
are numbers out yesterday Right stock would have dropped Then you could solve all

347
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,130
today Pranav, how can you get access to this data?

348
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:50,150
The closest you can get right now Pranav is through the new terminal where all you

349
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,690
would do is you just go to news and sentiment and They'll tell you right there.

350
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:03,010
Okay They'll tell you right here all the press releases regarding You just go you

351
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,830
look up a list of like companies releasing this week And you just go one by one

352
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,470
by one by one by one until you find them just bang it out and it's gonna be You

353
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,430
know, it's gonna be super tedious, right? That's uh,

354
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,210
and you would look it'd be it's ranked by data, right?

355
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,190
perhaps so you'd be like, okay,

356
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:22,670
I'm looking for pre releases after September 20th. Okay.

357
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:29,980
There's only one after September 20th here on to the next Marcos had a good question.

358
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,670
I'm gonna expand on it a little bit Jordan who should talk about this So he's like,

359
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,390
you know, what should we be looking for?

360
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,650
Is it if IV comes back up or does not drop and then there's a good trade?

361
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,890
So I think what we need to talk about here is familiarizing ourselves with how IV

362
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:50,950
moves Right and start looking at stocks through implied volatilities Right.

363
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,090
What do you think should happen Marcos? Right,

364
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,620
what should happen after this news comes out? Well,

365
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,700
the IV should come back down So let's say the IV didn't come back down Then there

366
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,260
would be a trade because we understand that with this new information Which reduces

367
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,350
the likelihood of a jump on the event?

368
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,560
That there should be less volatility So we expect it to drop if we don't see it

369
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,240
drop then there's a trade if it starts to come back up Why is it coming back up?

370
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,440
Is it coming back for any reason in particular?

371
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,640
It doesn't change the fact this information's out So the trade just gets juicier

372
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,860
the opportunity might come back Now the only thing that is going to take some getting

373
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,520
used to for you and Jordan Maybe you can recommend some ways for people to start

374
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,640
familiarizing themselves with this is what if it drops a little bit But not enough

375
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,220
or it comes back up a bit,

376
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,140
but not really enough How do we know what the different levels that it rises to

377
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,360
or drops to signify? You know what I mean? Yeah,

378
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,380
like and it's things like pre levels and stuff.

379
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,360
But like how can they start familiarizing? We start thinking about it,

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,280
right we really got think just just Logically think about it.

381
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,290
I want someone to come in here and tell me quick and tell Sean quick.

382
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,700
How could we? How can we benchmark this? What do you guys think would be like?

383
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,940
Okay, this ball is too. It's too cheap now I can't sell it.

384
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,590
I'm gonna put the IV on the terminal Give him something to look at her. No,

385
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,290
let's say Yeah, no earnings tab. Yeah, what do you guys think?

386
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,660
When would we say vol is too cheap to sell if it information came up,

387
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,980
what could we benchmark it to?

388
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,060
You're gonna put the distribution of the implied move over this Yeah, okay.

389
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:47,410
That would nice What do you guys think no answers here?

390
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,680
Previous moves exactly, right?

391
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,640
The average move is 5% and you were gonna sell it at 8% Information just came out.

392
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,360
It went back down to let's say 5% Well,

393
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,480
this is not an average move You shouldn't have an average move here You just have

394
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,820
a lot more information a lot less ball should be baked into this option So it's

395
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,860
gonna be less than average.

396
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:18,250
So if the implied move is still average you want to be selling that right?

397
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,070
Well,

398
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,320
you can benchmark it to the average move There's just exactly right Steve,

399
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,250
right guys So I want to you know,

400
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,850
just just clarify one thing because I know we've got a lot of the new guys in here

401
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,210
Right now, okay. This is real trading Okay,

402
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:40,080
when I say that what I mean is we're making a really educated trade here This is

403
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,100
how like in the real world outside of social media and all of this stuff.

404
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,220
This is what's happening in Different ways different shapes and forms.

405
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,580
This is exactly what people are doing and it's trades like this You know where people

406
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,280
build up a large sum of capital they raise capital they start doing things like

407
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,840
this, you know Obviously as you scale it's not exactly this strategy,

408
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,520
but it's things like this It's evaluating something understanding how something

409
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:11,440
should be priced versus what it is right now and making a trade That people make

410
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,830
a lot of money, right?

411
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,300
Think about it like If you have no idea what something's worth or what it should

412
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,150
be worth. What are you trading? How you making money right?

413
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,170
We got to know this stuff.

414
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:27,400
And when we do know this stuff we make good trades We're basically saying this thing's

415
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,820
going for five bucks and it should be going for three bucks So it's a good trade

416
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:38,750
for me to sell it See what I'm saying guys You know now like if let's say the average

417
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,490
move is 5% and this this stuff the same thing came out and move went to zero There's

418
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:49,660
no earnings we've priced in Maybe it's too cheap Maybe they basically maybe there's

419
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,410
they're not accounting. They're not giving any margin for error, you know,

420
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,610
like so We got to think this way guys, right?

421
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:04,590
This is the lens of expected value This is really what we're talking about And when

422
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,450
you get in the groove of doing this and thinking like this you get a lot more confident

423
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,550
Kyle this is actually I'm logged into your I'm logged into your Account so only

424
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,050
you have that one in the bottom left corner. Okay.

425
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,550
No one else has that one Okay,

426
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,150
so that is basically the live guys on looking for yeah opportunity That's what we

427
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,970
got. What do you guys think thoughts comments concerns?
