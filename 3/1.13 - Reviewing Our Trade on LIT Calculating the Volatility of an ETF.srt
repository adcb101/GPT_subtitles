1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,630
All right, guys. So in this lecture,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,550
we are going to be chatting about our lit position that we took.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,290
And the ticker is LIT. And breaking down the implied vols for it,

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,820
as well as building out how to calculate the implied volatility for a portfolio.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,760
Okay, this is actually in the silver exam.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,520
It's the last question on the silver exam.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,900
I think only two people got the answer right for it.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,130
So we're going to break it down in detail today. Okay, so without further ado,

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,550
let us jump into the terminal and take a look at this position here.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
So maybe start with like how we, how you know, once again,

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,000
shout out to Kyle for signaling the trade.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,620
But let's talk about how Kyle was actually,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,740
how he found this trade to start with.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,160
It'd be nice if he actually popped into the lives,

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,760
but he's skipping class again.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,910
So the way Kyle structured this position or found this position was he basically

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,150
created a scanner for himself. So certain criterias he looks for before he,

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,150
to scan through, let's say a thousand equities, right? So he'll scan for,

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,810
let's say high implied volatility percentile, right?

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,830
Which is called high IV rank in the scanner.

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,750
And we're going to actually go over that, go over that scan for you here.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,520
He's looking for liquidity, right? Is this thing at least a little bit liquid.

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,680
So when he gets into the position, he doesn't move the market, right?

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,380
A lot of the time people think, Oh, if I see an edge, I can just get in. Right.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,880
And we actually see the opposite. If there's a big edge there,

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,860
it's usually going to be hard to take advantage of.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,720
So we always need to remember that we've shown multiple times how when we start

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,760
scaling into positions, you just see the market maker start to back off, right?

29
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,890
So we really need to always remember that when we're taking these trades.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,170
So he scans for liquidity,

31
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,450
and then he also scans for implied volatility over our forecast. Okay.

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,790
So let us jump right into the terminal and see how he did this.

33
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,250
So when we head over to the volatility analyzer, okay.

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,350
We'll go to volatility insights.

35
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,410
What Kyle usually does is he scans.

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,590
So he wants IV versus our forecast greater than one. Okay.

37
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,930
And this just means that the implied volatility is greater.

38
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,930
The market forecast of volatility is greater than what we're forecasting.

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:39,930
What he also likes to do is he likes to have IV 30 day greater than 30. Okay.

40
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,060
So he likes to have it. So at least there's some type of volatility. Okay.

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,020
There's some type of volatility. Average option volume. He likes to have,

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,460
I think he has it at 3000, I believe,

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,290
you know, I don't know if 3000 is going to cut it, but anyways, well, you know,

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,490
just, just for now, it was, but I think it was higher than 3000,

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,830
but just for now, we're going to bring that down to 1000.

46
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,620
So at least there's like a thousand options traded on this product daily,

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,630
daily. And then what I think he does lastly is flips for IV rank. Okay.

48
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,690
And he's going to start for, so now if we think about it guys,

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,790
we have implied volatility over our forecast.

50
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,930
We have at least implied volatility over 30 and we have at least some type of liquidity.

51
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,390
Okay. And right off the bat, these are probably, these are all bio stocks.

52
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,290
So he's probably not looking at that. But here we go right here, right?

53
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,030
Fifth one on the list is, is lit. Okay. So on the second page,

54
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,570
we see it right here and let's break down what's going on. Right?

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,910
So we've got the price above, we got the price at 56.

56
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,370
We have the average option volume at 2000.

57
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,270
So 2000 options are traded on average for this product.

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,510
The implied volatility is 1.4 times greater than the forecast.

59
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:08,310
We have the implied vol 30 day above about 48. And we see the realized vol.

60
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,750
So this in the last 20 days, right? The stock is only realized 25% vol.

61
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,580
All right. We see our, our forecast of volatility is 35 and you know,

62
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,140
nothing really else to take a look at here.

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,370
The IV rank is in the 90th percentile. Okay. So it's, it's quite high up there.

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,180
All right. So now let's, let's break this down.

65
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:42,380
So obviously stocks been climbing like crazy. We have implied vol 90 day. Okay.

66
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,890
Quite bid.

67
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,920
Oh, you know what guys we're at a, we're on a, let's go to ARK. Wait, why ARK?

68
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,820
Aren't we looking at lit? Oh, sorry. Lit. My apologies.

69
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,010
Do an entire breakdown on the wrong stuff. Could you imagine that?

70
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,750
You'd be like, this is why. Okay. So take this out guys. Right?

71
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,820
We're seeing implied volatility, both the 30 and the 90 day at all.

72
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,840
Like it's the only time it's been higher than this was during the COVID levels.

73
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,440
Right. And you can see that the realized vol it's, it's much further down,

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,140
right?

75
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,400
So the stock's barely realizing anything yet the implied vol is through the roof.

76
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,490
Okay. And we can see this here.

77
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,770
If we look at the volatility cone that these wave, you know, these,

78
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,090
these far dated options are extremely bid relative to what it's been before.

79
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,450
So let's actually zoom in on here. I'm going to remove the max. Okay.

80
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,090
And we're just going to look here.

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,480
So what we notice is the options that are 90 days out, right?

82
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,800
These 90 day options are a lot more expensive than,

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,280
or a lot higher than the third quantile. Okay. So what that means is,

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,980
so the third quantile below means that that's where 75% of the data is. Okay.

85
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,520
So if we look at all the data for, let's say a two year period,

86
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,660
which this looks at 75% of the time, it's below about 34%.

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,220
And right now it's trading at 46, right? So you can see this,

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,380
this is extremely, extremely good.

89
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,030
So I'm going to just going to show you guys one more thing before we start breaking

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,570
this thing down.

91
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,820
We'll plot lit here. So we're going to move over to the relative value tab.

92
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,780
We'll plot lit. Okay. Versus we're gonna plot the 90 day options. Okay.

93
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,880
Versus the realized vol. And we're going to see the ratio of that.

94
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,400
And what we notice is this ratio is near the highs, right?

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,480
Meaning it's extremely high relative to realized volatility. It's even,

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,880
especially if we look and compare that to the past. Okay.

97
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,060
The 90 day divided by the realized vol, the 30 days realized vol, we get this,

98
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,600
this structure. Okay.

99
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,320
You can see that this process looks like it to be mean reverting, you know,

100
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,420
and I wouldn't say it's stationary, but it's definitely mean reverting.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,940
And you know,

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
we should probably see some type of mean reversion to maybe let's say the 1.1 level,

103
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,410
but we don't, we don't need to end our analysis there. Right.

104
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,630
What we can actually do is compare this to things like the NASDAQ.

105
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,260
Let's look at the NASDAQ 90 vol. Okay. Versus lit. And look at this guys,

106
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,750
right? We're seeing this thing extremely bid relative to the NASDAQ.

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,500
And it's funny because there's a few stocks and we're going to go,

108
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,640
we're going to break down lit in a second,

109
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,480
but there's a few stocks in lit that have that are in the NASDAQ.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,460
So just so you guys know, lit is a lithium, a lithium ETF.

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,520
So it holds a lot of products.

112
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,380
And let's break this down further. What if we compare lit to let's say Tesla?

113
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,340
You explained Tesla's one of the big holdings. Yeah, exactly.

114
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,360
Tesla's one of the big holdings in lit. And look at this.

115
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,500
Lit is a lot higher in terms of historical ratio, right?

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
Where it is right now versus where it usually is. Okay.

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,000
So we're seeing this thing is just extremely, extremely bid on multiple,

118
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,400
multiple scenarios.

119
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,480
Okay. All good.

120
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,620
So, but with any, every trade guys, we can't just be like, Oh, you know,

121
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,040
this looks like a fantastic trade. Let's go and tell it.

122
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,120
What we really need to do is understand.

123
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,680
What we really need to do is understand this product, right? And Chris,

124
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,920
this might help you answer your question, right? Chris was asking,

125
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,420
doesn't that mean the market is expecting something weird to happen? Yes.

126
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,020
Maybe not weird to happen, Chris, but the market is expecting a huge move,

127
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:58,130
right? One of the biggest moves ever in the last two years. Okay.

128
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,170
Market's expecting something huge to happen.

129
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,950
So we need to understand what's going on in this product, right?

130
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,160
We can't just be like, you know what? Let's just take this.

131
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,300
It looks pretty good. I'm going to take it right at the end of the day.

132
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,480
We want to get some pretty good size on these types of trades.

133
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,100
And to be able to get size,

134
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,460
we need to be able to stay with the position and to be able to stay with the position.

135
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,400
We need to fully understand it. Okay. So any questions so far, guys,

136
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,280
we're going to be moving on and continuing our breakdown here.

137
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,360
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. You sure even for the new people,

138
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,540
don't hesitate to ask any questions.

139
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,760
We're going to break it down for you and make sure that you are fully understanding

140
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,680
this along the way.

141
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,020
Yes, Danny. So we are going to that's what we're going to go to and do next.

142
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,420
But so far, guys, summary so far,

143
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:58,200
implied volatility is extremely expensive on different scenarios against realized

144
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,960
vols, against historical implied vols,

145
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,380
against other assets that are similar to it. Okay,

146
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,080
which we are noticing that lit is pretty expensive relative to everything we're

147
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,490
looking at. Okay. And now that gives us a signal to look deeper.

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,820
So we pull up lit and we take a look at it. Okay.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,020
So here is the fact sheet for lit. And we're going to,

150
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,000
we're going to really look at this in depth guys to make sure we fully understand.

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,620
So, okay, perfect. So Chris is saying,

152
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,080
and maybe Danny's having this is asking this as well.

153
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,840
Understanding why is my biggest problem.

154
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,880
So I was actually talking to John about this. A lot of the time, guys,

155
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,760
the market is efficient, right?

156
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,940
There's not going to be a trade every single day,

157
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,660
even though recently it's been like that every day, every day, right? Yeah.

158
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,360
Over a year. It's not every day. Yeah. It's,

159
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,700
you're not going to find a trade every day.

160
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,300
If you're finding a trade every single day,

161
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,860
especially let's say on a daily timeframe or a weekly timeframe, the market is,

162
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,120
is being very inefficient, right?

163
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,380
There shouldn't be like this massive amounts of alpha in the world because there

164
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,760
are people like us, there are people like you, right? And when I say us,

165
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, predicting alpha as a team.

166
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,610
And there's people at Morgan Stanley and there's people at Goldman.

167
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,230
Every single day, those guys come to work,

168
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,170
they sit at their desk and they look for opportunities.

169
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,090
And so if there's an opportunity that presents itself,

170
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,490
it's usually going to be taken advantage of. So for that reason,

171
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,350
the market is going to be efficient most of the time.

172
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,780
So if we don't understand why, right, it might be because there is no reason,

173
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,430
right?

174
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,490
Or there's a good reason on why vol is so big or why vol is so compressed.

175
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,410
Okay. So let's take a look here. Let's see what's going on with this ETF.

176
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,190
So we find out, let's see if they have a little explanation about the company,

177
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,410
about the,

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:02,550
okay, here we go. Okay. So this is the global lithium and battery tech ETF.

179
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,510
Okay.

180
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,720
So that is what, that is what this ETF is.

181
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,260
And net asset values is about 1.5 billion. Okay.

182
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,660
Shares outstanding 20 million total expense ratio, you know,

183
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,900
unimportant for us and basically no, no yield, no dividend yield.

184
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,140
So let's jump into it. So what is in this ETF, right? What are like,

185
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,990
what would be driving the vols? And we noticed a few things right off the bat.

186
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:42,180
Okay. We have Tesla, 10% of the ETF is Tesla. Okay.

187
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,140
And I'm sure a lot of these other companies are pretty,

188
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,890
are pretty big involves as well, but 10% of this company is Tesla.

189
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Now we saw this exact same scenario happen with ARK.

190
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,520
ARK caught such a bid because 10% of that was Tesla, right?

191
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,260
We are going to basically see the S&P 500 move up half a vol point or almost half

192
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:13,130
a vol point because Tesla is 1.5% of the index. Imagine scaling that by six,

193
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,730
right? And that's what's happening to this ETF. So you have Tesla,

194
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,970
which went from 70 vol to a hundred vol,

195
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,280
and that's driving a huge portion of the volatility for a lithium and, and,

196
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,660
and sorry, and not lithium, but the ETF. Okay. So when we're looking at an ETF,

197
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,400
we need to actually see what's driving the components here.

198
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,870
What's driving the components. So for example,

199
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,550
and I'll leave this for you guys to do, you can do research on this one, right?

200
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,230
What's going on here? What's going on here? You know, let's look,

201
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,670
if we look at the top 10 of top five holdings, right,

202
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:59,480
we're talking about 40% of the way of the ETF, you know,

203
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,300
so if you can understand these products right here, what's going on with them,

204
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,260
you understand 40% of the ETF.

205
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,760
I think something worth mentioning is half the ETF is in China. Yep.

206
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,960
Another thing to notice half the ETF is in China. So if we were like,

207
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,420
let's say, look at the Chinese ETF, does anyone know what the Chinese ETF is?

208
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,300
No,

209
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,400
no. It's does anybody know what the Chinese ETF is?

210
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,440
No, no. Going once, going twice, Chinese ETF.

211
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,770
There it is. That's the one. Thanks, Steve.

212
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,480
Vol should be up for it. So we see vols are down, right?

213
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,160
So if we really start to break down this ETF here,

214
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,010
we're actually going to start to realize that not a lot of this stuff is bid,

215
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,550
but Tesla is huge. Tesla is really driving the vols here. Now,

216
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,810
before we go and talk about pricing,

217
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,450
before we go talk about pricing an ETF and pricing the implied volatilities for

218
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,210
an ETF in a basket, let us,

219
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,730
let us understand why we actually liked selling vols on ETFs.

220
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,580
So one of the main reason we like to sell vols on ETF is there's no company specific

221
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,470
risk. Okay. Example,

222
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,400
this company or this ETF is not going to wake up bankrupt tomorrow, right?

223
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,360
It's not going to wake up probably down 10% in a day, right?

224
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,930
Because it has this diversification and we see that in the realized volatility.

225
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,970
Okay. We see this diversification in the realized volatility.

226
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,800
If you're selling vol on Tesla, for example,

227
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,970
the thing could gap down 10% tomorrow off some news about the company, right?

228
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,370
This, an ETF is not going to have that. Right.

229
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,700
And that's why we're not seeing this huge realized vol. So for that reason,

230
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,740
we like to sell vol on ETFs, especially, right? Especially when they're misbid.

231
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,820
And sometimes even driven just by one, by one company.

232
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,200
So let's head back to Lit. What also we know, so the more we diversify guys,

233
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,640
the less vol is the less the realized vol is. And we're going to,

234
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,540
we're going to show the math and the example behind it,

235
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,220
but the less the realized vol is, but look at this ETF where we don't just,

236
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,960
this is not the S&P 500 in the U S this is a global company, a global ETF,

237
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,720
right? We are not diversifying just by ticker.

238
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,050
We are also diversifying by country, right? And for that reason,

239
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,060
we get those compressed vols, right? We might have, for example,

240
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,110
China goes on a tear and USD falls. Well,

241
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,130
if the ETF is exposed to both China and U S well, that's also going to,

242
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,130
you know, that's going to offset each other.

243
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,970
They're going to offset each other, right?

244
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,290
And that's going to compress the vols.

245
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,510
So here we have a diversified ETF where implied volatility is a lot larger than

246
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,950
realized. We understand you, we understand mostly what's driving that vol.

247
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,380
It's the Tesla, the Tesla factor. And, you know, we know,

248
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,040
we understand why Tesla is so big. It just got into the S&P, right? We also,

249
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,780
we also did some research on stock twist. Everybody loves this thing, right?

250
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,430
We've got 20,000 watchers, 95% bullish, right? People are,

251
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,910
and also I looked at the call volume versus the put volume and we saw like 10 times

252
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,460
more calls being bought. So it made sense. This whole picture made sense to us,

253
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,940
right? We understood basically what's happening here. Okay.

254
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,840
Do you guys have any questions about that?

255
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,500
We understand the product. It's a, it's a lithium, a global lithium index.

256
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,020
We understand what our risks are, right?

257
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:19,240
We understand what we're exposed to Steve saying, but you have big realized,

258
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,640
Oh, can't go bankrupt. Can't be bought. Actually,

259
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,800
if a company's bought fall should drop. Yeah. So right. But,

260
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,780
but the realized vol will spike and we'll lose money.

261
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,120
So it can't be bought out. It can't be, it can't go bankrupt. Right.

262
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,290
And for that reason vol is compressed. Okay. So Marcus thing don't,

263
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,130
I still don't understand why it's so bad. Yep. So we're gonna,

264
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,290
we're gonna show that right now, Marcos.

265
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,860
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

266
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Sometimes I still get a little nervous on these lives, man.

267
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,160
Especially when you get these big turnouts, 25 people. Ooh. Okay.

268
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,420
So here we go. So we got this ETF. Okay. We're going to call this ETF.

269
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,780
And before we go over the math, we're going to talk about it.

270
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,610
So this ETF holds two stocks, hold stock one. Okay. We're going to say Tesla.

271
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:24,020
Okay. And then it holds this Chinese stock. Now Tesla rallies 10%.

272
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
Okay. Rally's 10%,

273
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,480
but this Chinese stock drops 10%.

274
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,940
Well, what, what is this ETF going to do? Assuming they're equally weighted,

275
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,240
assuming they're equally weighted, what is this ETF going to do?

276
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,810
Right. It's going to be flat.

277
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,490
So for that reason, okay. If the assets inside this basket are not correlated,

278
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,840
okay. If they were negatively correlated, vol would be zero.

279
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,380
If they were not correlated, right. It's going to be some number less than 10%.

280
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,530
Okay. Vol is going to move some number less than 10%.

281
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,890
They're not a hundred percent correlated.

282
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,850
And that is, and that is the diversification power. Okay.

283
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,670
Let's look at a second scenario.

284
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,610
Tesla moves down 10% and Chinese stock moves down 10%.

285
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,780
Okay. Well now this ETF is going to move down 10%.

286
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:50,720
Okay. So having these assets uncorrelated is what we want in this ETF,

287
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,540
because that's going to drive vol down and having that diversification in multiple

288
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,910
countries. It's not just like two country guys. Look at this. Oops.

289
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,160
It's not just two countries.

290
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,840
We're talking like seven countries, eight countries, right? Sure. You know,

291
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,440
the top five countries make up the majority, but we still have some exposure,

292
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,520
you know, across the board here. So,

293
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,220
and these countries are very different from each other as well,

294
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,820
which is awesome. We have industry diversification.

295
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,040
We've got industry diversification. Exactly. Right.

296
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,340
So we have equity diversification, industry diversification,

297
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,760
country diversification.

298
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,240
So you saying, okay, to play devil's advocate, this is quite a specialized ETF.

299
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,460
This isn't the spy. A hundred percent agree.

300
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,320
So what we can do is we're going to do some,

301
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,040
we're going to do some raw coding here for you guys.

302
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,970
We're going to pull all of these ETFs. Oh, I need the,

303
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,710
we need to pull, we need to pull the tickers here. Okay.

304
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,970
Can someone look up these? So let's see, Steve, can you look at the,

305
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,850
up the tickers for, let's say these two and then Marcos,

306
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,090
can you look at the tickers for these two at the bottom?

307
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,790
And we need all these tickers. Yeah. And then let's say, who else is on here?

308
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:25,570
Gilesto. Can you look for, we already know Tesla. Okay. Let me just,

309
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,970
one second guys here.

310
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,300
We're going to do some raw coding guys.

311
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,920
We're going to build the correlation matrix.

312
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,990
Okay. Great. Good. Yeah. Okay.

313
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,310
Ready? Yeah. What do we, do we got them? Do we got the tickers in?

314
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,220
What do we got?

315
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,380
Slacking. Wow. Steven saying ALB. Okay guys, come on. Let's,

316
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,460
let's get the tickers in here.

317
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:08,820
Oops.

318
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's get the tickers in here.

319
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,040
We got ALB.

320
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,570
What else we got here guys?

321
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,600
SQM. Okay. Let's keep it going. One of the top five.

322
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,200
And Marcos is saying GNE NF. I don't know if they're going to have this year.

323
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,900
Let's give it a shot.

324
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,220
If not, we're just going to have to look at the top three guys.

325
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,950
I think we got it. Let's see.

326
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,060
I think we got it guys. Oops.

327
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,570
Cool. Oh, so liquid. Oh my goodness. Okay.

328
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,940
Okay guys, we're in some raw coding here and it always breaks.

329
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,190
As some of you guys know, as soon as you guys know,

330
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
code always breaks in live demo.

331
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,040
Okay. What else do we got here? Triswati is having a good laugh at that.

332
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,820
I know, I know. She understands the hustle.

333
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,550
Okay guys, you know what? Okay. Whatever. Hold on. Sorry guys.

334
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,250
Let's see how big, let's see how much data we got for a SQM.

335
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,580
Okay. You know what? We're just going to look at, unfortunately guys,

336
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,360
we're just going to look at a three and, and KRW.

337
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,900
We'll do KRW because the other ones, they don't have a lot of data.

338
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:15,710
So it's not going to be great if we don't, no, no KRW. Okay guys.

339
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,290
So we're going to go with these ones right here. Tesla, ALB, SQM. Okay.

340
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,830
Unfortunately we don't have time to, to really,

341
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,980
to really extract all the good data here. Okay. So let's do it.

342
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:39,300
Okay. Let's just make sure we got them all. We got Tesla. You know what?

343
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,480
Let's do a 2018.

344
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,200
Okay. Let's see what we got here. We got Tesla.

345
00:25:54,530 --> 00:26:02,300
You got ALB and SQM. We got that. Okay.

346
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,060
So what we're going to do here guys is we are going to create this new data frame.

347
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:22,880
We're going to, with Tesla's close, ALB, and we're going to do SQM. Okay.

348
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,690
And what we're going to do is we're going to calculate the returns for these ETFs.

349
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,320
Okay. So let's, let's take a look here guys. So if you take a look,

350
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,660
for example, these are the returns. So Tesla return,

351
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,680
ALBs return and SQM return. So now when we plot the correlation matrix,

352
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,410
okay, here we go. Check this out guys.

353
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,000
Tesla correlation with ALB at the daily level is only 27%.

354
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:03,000
Tesla correlation with SQM at the daily level is only 39%. Right. ALB with,

355
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,920
with SQM is only 66%.

356
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:12,080
So it's not like these stocks right now are super correlated. Right.

357
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,580
So now we need to calculate what is, what is the,

358
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,910
what should the implied vols be of this ETF? Okay. And the formula.

359
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,670
Assuming it would be those three assets. Right.

360
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,810
Assuming it's going to be those three assets. Which make up according,

361
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,010
thanks Josta for this. They make up 22% of it. Wow. Wow.

362
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,030
So right off the bat guys, these, you know,

363
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,950
if we add maybe one more of those Chinese ones that are like 30%,

364
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,030
we're at like 30%, maybe even 40%. Yeah. Right. Now that's,

365
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,560
that's like most of the index. Yeah. Top five was 40%. Top five is 40%. So,

366
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,140
you know, you just got to look at the correlation matrix plotting up, um,

367
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,390
put in the vols and out should come the, uh, the index. Right.

368
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,250
We have some form of correlation matrix in the, uh, we do,

369
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:02,320
we have the correlation matrix in, um, the watch list in the watch list tab.

370
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,880
Okay. So for those of you that don't know, just quickly head over there. Okay.

371
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,560
For those of you that don't know, you head over to watch list,

372
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,480
throw in the three tickers. I don't think we'll have those Chinese ones.

373
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,140
Oh yeah. We might. Let's see. ALB. We do. What was the other one? SQM. No. Uh,

374
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:28,300
okay. Let's test. Okay. So here we go. Boom. Boom. And the indicators, well,

375
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,800
let's just like IP 30. Okay. Price. Uh, and whatever,

376
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,220
whatever you guys want to choose SKU. Okay. And that, and here's the beta,

377
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,160
right? Here's that beta to ALB that 30%, that 30% beta that we see. Okay.

378
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,360
So here's the correlation matrix. Um,

379
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,090
for those of you that want to use the watch list tab down the road. All right.

380
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,890
That's fine. I built this one for Steven. He hasn't done it. He hasn't used it.

381
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,530
Hasn't used it even once. All right. Let's head back over here.

382
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,660
So we're going to do this. Um,

383
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,980
you're going to do this, uh, with the two asset portfolio right now,

384
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,240
but you could just add a third one is a lot is a lot. It's super easy.

385
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,500
I'm gonna let you guys do this on, on your own time for practice. Okay.

386
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,000
So we're gonna do a two asset portfolio.

387
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,960
And then for the three asset portfolio,

388
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
you guys can go and practice that one on your own. Okay.

389
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,240
And you don't need any programming for this.

390
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,440
All you need is a pencil and paper or a calculator. Sorry.

391
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,420
You need a calculator. You'll need a calculator. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

392
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,820
So the formula to calculate this is going to be, so it's going to be,

393
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,920
we're going to put this here. So the, uh, the ball of the portfolio. Okay.

394
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,720
So remember an ETF is just a portfolio. It's just like,

395
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,740
when you look at your portfolio, you have a little ETF, you have a little ETF.

396
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,540
It's like saying, you know, imagine you packaged it up.

397
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,060
You packaged up your portfolio and said, Hey, Sean, Jordan,

398
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,040
you want to invest in it? Want to want to buy this, right? That's what it is.

399
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,440
And seeing some of your returns, we would love to, I'd be buying it. Yeah.

400
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,120
Seeing some of your terms recently, we're going to be buying some of yours.

401
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,160
You look at, uh, Tico's portfolio breakdown. It's just Tesla. Yeah. One stock,

402
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,700
100%, one beta of one. Exactly. Beta of one to Tesla.

403
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,920
You got to change Tico's name to Tesla. I know. Right. Okay.

404
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:24,390
So it's going to equal to the square root. Okay. Uh, the weighting. Okay.

405
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,460
So we're going to call the weight of asset one. Okay.

406
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,320
To the power of two times the weight of asset two. I'm sorry.

407
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:40,320
Times the volatility of asset one to power of two plus the weight of number two

408
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:50,330
to the power of two times vol two to the power of two. Okay.

409
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:54,150
And then if you had a weight three B plus weight three, et cetera, et cetera,

410
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,810
et cetera. Okay.

411
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:05,720
Plus, okay. Plus two times. Okay. Two times the correlation between the assets.

412
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:12,410
Okay. So in this case it is, let's do Tesla and ALB. Okay. The correlation.

413
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:23,440
So 0.27 times the weight of asset one times the weight of asset two times the vol

414
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,040
of asset one times the vol of asset two. Now make sure guys,

415
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,740
you always square the first bit. Okay. You don't need to square the second bit.

416
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,100
Um, oh, actually instead of pie. And so I'm just going to put P okay. That's,

417
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,000
that's the correlation. Okay. So you would do the correlation of one by two.

418
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,460
Okay. Vol one, vol two, then the correlation of, uh, let's say asset two,

419
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,600
let's say SQM and Tesla times the weight of them times the vols. Okay.

420
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,320
And if you guys are so confused, I want you guys to practice this on your own,

421
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,620
give it a shot. And if you're still a little confused,

422
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,280
reach out to us and we'll do an example in the group.

423
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,680
But I really want you guys to try out, try this on your own first.

424
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,420
So here we go. Square root point. So we're going to,

425
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,640
we're going to put in the stuff now. Okay. So Tesla vol for example, is 0.90.

426
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:20,660
Okay. And the weighting is, um, we're going to say this is a 50% portfolio.

427
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,660
Okay. So let's say this is 50%.

428
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:34,940
So weighting squared times the volatility squared plus weighting of asset two squared

429
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:41,170
times, um, that, that volatility, which I have no clue.

430
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,910
If anyone wants to take a guess, we're going to go, we're going to say 0.5.

431
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:44,930
Okay.

432
00:32:48,130 --> 00:33:01,010
Plus two times correlation 0.27 times 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.9 times 0.5. Okay.

433
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,690
So what do you guys put a V1 as 0.9? Do you have it as 0.5 there? Oh, no,

434
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,530
you don't. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

435
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,490
So what do you guys think the answer is going to be here? Yeah.

436
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,040
What do you guys think the answer should be? I'm curious. So we got asset one,

437
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,700
50% implied vol asset two, 90% implied vol.

438
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
What do we think the portfolio is going to be? There's a correlation of 0.27.

439
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,740
No one with their calculators, no cheating. Just, just our idea,

440
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,000
our thought here. What do we think the answer is going to be?

441
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,490
Steven's saying 60%. Why Steve? Why are you saying 60? Marco's saying 60.

442
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,350
How come guys, why are you guys saying 60?

443
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,130
Okay. Nice. Nice. Right. Okay. I like that.

444
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,890
Now let me ask you this question though. Okay. Let me ask you this question.

445
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,190
And you know, we're going to play around with different correlations.

446
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,490
What do you guys think it would be if correlation was zero?

447
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,560
What do you guys think it would be if the correlation was zero?

448
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,080
Well, Marco saying 75.

449
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,870
Okay. So it's going to be a lot less. It's going to be a lot less.

450
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,350
So let's run this one.

451
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:32,550
57. You guys were almost bang on. Okay. 57% with the correlation of 0.27. Okay.

452
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,950
Now we're going to drop this down to zero.

453
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,720
We're getting 51%. Okay. So what we're seeing is as we,

454
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,760
as we continue to drop this, as we continue to drop the correlation,

455
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,120
okay. The vols are going to get more, less and less.

456
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,610
Right. And if we increase, if we move this up to one, you get 0.70. Okay.

457
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,190
Which is just basically the average of both.

458
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:08,900
Okay.

459
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,780
Yes. So it can go below Tico. If this is negative one, watch,

460
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,600
watch what's going to happen when this is negative one Tico.

461
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,090
Imagine these assets were completely negatively correlated. Opposite.

462
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,740
Goes down to 0.2. And in reality,

463
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,380
we're going to see this thing a lot closer to zero.

464
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,940
The reason why this is only 0.2 is because these, the vols on this, right.

465
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:39,060
0.9 is a little different than 0.5. If we turn this into 0.5 instead, if we,

466
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,800
if we change Tesla vol to 0.5,

467
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,620
right, we're actually going to get zero.

468
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,610
Right. Big fat L.

469
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:59,330
So moral of the story here, we can actually price the implied vol for this ETF.

470
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,340
And it should be very, very, very similar. Okay. Should be very, very similar,

471
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,940
but we actually have two components here.

472
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:13,480
We have the implied vols and we have the implied correlation. Okay.

473
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,720
Implied vols and implied correlation. So we might think, okay, well,

474
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,600
the implied correlation is probably way too high on this ETF. Right.

475
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,240
What we could do, for example, is put in all the implied vols for this ETF.

476
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,490
Okay. All the implied vols for each component,

477
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:38,290
put in all of the realized volatilities or realized correlations, right.

478
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:44,650
And we can come up with our, our estimate of the portfolio vol, right.

479
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:49,210
Or we can also find out what this P is, right. Because think about it guys,

480
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,730
we have the weights, we have the volatilities.

481
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,090
And I want you guys to do this as an example.

482
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,090
We have the weights and we have the volatilities.

483
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,080
The only thing we don't have is this P, this P value.

484
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,340
And this is what we call in trading the implied correlation. So I bet you guys,

485
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,960
if you guys were to look at this ETF, okay,

486
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,440
this number is going to be like 0.6 or 0.7 right now. When in actual fact,

487
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,930
it should be a lot closer to let's say 0.2. Okay.

488
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:30,480
So that is another reason why I bet you this ETF is bid. Okay.

489
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,360
The implied correlation is being bid up.

490
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,410
So we came in here, we sold vol and we're hoping for it to, it to drop. Okay.

491
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,790
And we sold vol through a structure that looked like this.

492
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,280
Okay. Some of you did April. So we'll do April.

493
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,460
I know Pranav did April.

494
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,340
So here's the position we have.

495
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:07,140
Okay. And we're hoping for vols to drop about 12 points.

496
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,470
And this is what we're going to end up with if we're right. Right. Luckily,

497
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,890
this happened to us with ARK and fingers crossed. This happens to us with LIT.

498
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,950
Make for a nice Christmas.

499
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,180
Steven's saying, so how, so how do you see, how did you see that?

500
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,860
How did you see that? What do you mean, buddy? See what?

501
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,300
Oh, you can just, if you want, we can, you can just do it by hand, Steve.

502
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,310
So you just take the weights. So we know everything here, right?

503
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,610
We know the weights, right? We know the weights of every, every component.

504
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:52,030
We know the vols of every component. All that we don't know is P.

505
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,860
Now we can have our assumption of P, right? We can do a correlation matrix,

506
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,440
right? And find out what P is,

507
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:09,670
or we can just plug everything in and see what the market has it for P, right?

508
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,480
Does that make sense, Steve? In the ETF sheets,

509
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,080
do they share the correlation between their assets?

510
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:24,500
They don't know because there's no, there's no, yeah, they don't show,

511
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,060
maybe actually, I don't think they do. You guys can check.

512
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,440
It would make sense for them to show it, wouldn't it?

513
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,720
Like for an investor to look at. Yeah, I guess. If I want to divert,

514
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,920
if I want diverse, you know,

515
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,280
a lot of them preach like we have diversified exposure in XYZ field.

516
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,230
Wouldn't that be? Yeah, but you can just back out P.

517
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,090
And if you want to do an example, Steve, we'll do one in the group together.

518
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,930
If we can just get, I can't get all the data here for this live.

519
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,170
But if you want to do it,

520
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,010
we can do an example in the group and find the implied correlation.

521
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,380
Exactly, right? The thing is, there's no, there's no, well,

522
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,020
the thing is though, Steve, we actually don't need,

523
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,440
we don't need realized history.

524
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,140
We don't need, all we're putting in is the implied and the weights.

525
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,640
All we need is the implied ball and the weights,

526
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,480
and we can find out what is the implied correlation. Okay. So for example,

527
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,280
if you want,

528
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,400
if you want to do this as exercise let's get all the implied ball data for all of

529
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,080
the stocks in that ETF, even though we might not be able to get it all,

530
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,800
but let's see how much we can get and let's build it up. Okay.

531
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,020
I think it's like, it's like 40 stocks. Let's see if we can get it all.

532
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,640
And we'll build out, build it out and calculate implied correlation.

533
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:42,830
Cool.

534
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,090
Okay. Okay. That is going to do it for tonight's live.

535
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,200
Still does not tell why it's so bad since Tesla's not even close to all time highs.

536
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,020
Well, Marcos, do you mean all time high in terms of vols?

537
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,040
So Tesla is extremely high in terms of implied volatility, right?

538
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,360
And so that's driving a huge portion of the vol here.

539
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,380
And the other portion might be because of this implied correlation.

540
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:19,900
Remember Tesla is 10% of this thing. So if we're seeing Tesla at 90% vol,

541
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,040
that's going to be driving this quite a bit.

542
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,200
That's really going to be driving the vol on the CTF, right?

543
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,140
And we might even see some spillover, right?

544
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,100
There's some other lithium stocks that are getting,

545
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,940
they're catching a bid in implied vol terms.

546
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,580
Okay. So it might not be Tesla's at all time highs, but it's extremely high,

547
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
right? And that's driving the vol.

548
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,580
We saw one of the reasons why we were easily able to move into a lit is because

549
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,680
we had the same experience with ARK,

550
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,390
right? Everyone was trying to get exposure through Tesla,

551
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:04,810
either explicitly by buying Tesla or by buying the ETF surrounding it that have

552
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,610
big stakes in it.

553
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:22,400
Okay. Marcos, did that make sense? I guess to summarize it, Marcos,

554
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,340
we understand this product. That's the first thing.

555
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:33,400
We understand what this ETF does. Next, we see what is driving vol here. Okay.

556
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,900
And we could do the implied correlation breakdown,

557
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,060
figure out what's being implied in the correlation by the market. Easy to do.

558
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,440
We don't need any coding for this. You can do it pencil and paper.

559
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,910
And then we also know that one of the biggest components in the ETF is that 90%

560
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,320
vol, right? And we know why people are buying Tesla vol.

561
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:09,090
It's been working out for us so far, but once Tesla vol drops,

562
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,360
let's say below that threshold, that might be gone.

563
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,660
But a strategy that you could build out possibly is find out what is the implied

564
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,500
correlation in a whole bunch of these ETFs, whichever ones have the highest,

565
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,020
you could sell some vol there.

566
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,300
Tico raised his hand. Tico, you want to chat?

567
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:47,160
These guys are crazy. Okay. Okay, guys. Should we skew it topside?

568
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,180
Because it has the call skew. Oh, topside? Up to you, Tico.

569
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,880
It's really up to you, man. Remember,

570
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,560
most of our P&L is going to come from the level of volatility,

571
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,920
not from the skew.

572
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:06,950
So we have it like this, Tico. So the 55 is really at the money, right?

573
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:12,580
This is at the money, the 55. You can see that through the Delta, right?

574
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,940
You can see that the Delta here is about 58, 41. But we decided to sell the 60,

575
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,700
a little bit of upside, and then sell the 55.

576
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,820
Okay. So there's not too much call skew here, Tico, you can see right now.

577
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,540
So we're not too inclined to be selling those. Blessing had a good question.

578
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,500
Why do we do a strangle over a straddle? Yeah. Blessing,

579
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,740
there's no real at the money straddle.

580
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,320
Maybe just pull it up. So check this out, Blessing.

581
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,900
If I do a straddle here at the money,

582
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,220
you can see, Blessing, we got a little bit of negative Delta, right?

583
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,860
We want the stock to go down, right? Stock's trading over here.

584
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,820
We want it to go down. We don't really want that. No, we have no view on that.

585
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,900
So we tried to eliminate it. So we structured it to get rid of it.

586
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,340
And so we did this, right? So now we're flat on Delta.

587
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,440
And then also by going flat Delta,

588
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,740
we actually get to sell a little bit more call side vol,

589
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
because we think call side is slightly overpriced.

590
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,420
Okay.

591
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,940
Okay, man, these lives have been going for 50 minutes, 60 minutes.

592
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,860
They're intense. They're intense lives.

593
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,620
I appreciate everyone sticking to the end and I hope you're getting a lot out of

594
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,120
it. Some pretty tough topics,

595
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:53,670
but we're going to mix it up with some more fundamental topics as well,

596
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,850
just to accommodate for everyone who comes through. And yeah, guys,

597
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,030
we're trying to throw you guys into the fire a bit.

598
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,550
Some of the members here saw the most growth just by getting thrown into the fire.

599
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,290
So Mark was just saying,

600
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,550
I believe our most challenging issues is getting right what is going on.

601
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,240
I think so as well, understanding why this thing is bid, right?

602
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,480
Why is this thing so expensive?

603
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,630
But I think this one is a little bit easier to understand.

604
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,250
Everybody is long ARK, right? I was talking with Koa the other day.

605
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,470
He was telling me about ARK, right? He was telling me,

606
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,090
this thing's a great ETF. Sean was telling me about his friends buying ARK,

607
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,730
but it wasn't everybody buying ARK.

608
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,690
Everybody's like anyone I know who loves tech, they're like, oh, ARK, ARK,

609
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:48,090
right? So we kind of understand who's buying vol, right? It makes sense.

610
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,970
We understand the underlying components, right? In ARK, for example,

611
00:46:51,150 --> 00:47:00,020
the top holdings were Roku, Tesla, CRM, Salesforce, work, right?

612
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,310
And so these are like the top stocks by retail traders,

613
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:13,190
right? Exactly. Stephen, it's like all the WSB traders in one ETF,

614
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,190
all their favorite stocks in one ETF.

615
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,190
And so it makes sense that the vol is bid,

616
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,130
right? And it's just, it was so bad that we got in there, said, fuck it,

617
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,630
let's sell it.

618
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,910
So there you go.

619
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:32,610
And also guys,

620
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,110
something to keep in mind a little bit more for those of you that are doing this,

621
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,350
that want to calculate the implied correlation.

622
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,680
When vols increase, correlation decreases. If it's not always true,

623
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,060
if we're getting, let's say, a down move in the market, you know,

624
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,740
usually correlation starts to increase.

625
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,900
But if the market's not moving and stocks increase in vols,

626
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,200
we usually actually get a decrease in correlation.

627
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,580
Koaw, you dog.

628
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,960
Who is it? This is probably someone who's on their team at ARK. And he's like,

629
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,060
she's not.

630
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:19,390
We don't know, right? With ARK, for example, it lasted one hour.

631
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,440
It was so funny. So we actually got in the position.

632
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,240
I went to go get a bagel and I get a message from Kyle, like, dude,

633
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,200
look at the vols, check the print. I checked the print,

634
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,460
P&L is already rolling in. So, you know, you have situations like that,

635
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,160
where it's like, it works better than expected.

636
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,340
And then you have times where it could last. Then you have trades like SLV,

637
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,020
where it lasts. A month, two months. Yeah, that was a two month trade, right?

638
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,040
Still printed, but. Took a while.

639
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:53,340
Okay, guys. Koaw, maybe you two should become acquainted. You can have nice,

640
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,420
long talks about Tesla.

641
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,750
Okay. All right. We're going to wrap it up there.

642
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,730
It was very nice seeing everyone. And we will see you tomorrow.

643
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,480
Have a great night, everyone. See you.
