1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
I'm going to shape my beard, hopefully, uh, you got to go to offman, man.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,020
Next, if this, if this, uh, come on, if work pays off, then I'll, uh, okay.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,880
So, um, guys, so in this video, we're going to be talking about, uh,

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
managing relative value positions. I know, you know,

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,420
I've told you guys a lot of my book is relative value that is though,

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,520
because I'm a little bit bigger size. Um,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,960
and we're going to talk a little bit about that today as well,

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
but a lot of you guys have been asking me like Jordan, you know,

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,990
how do I manage these positions? Like, you know,

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,990
so today we're going to be talking about that.

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,420
How do you actually manage these relative value positions? And, uh,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
first and foremost, guys, these positions get extremely messy, right?

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,860
The really complicated trades. Um, I don't know if you guys saw my tweet, but,

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,920
uh, relative value understanding relative value is a little tricky, right?

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,100
It's a little bit of a hard concept,

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,540
but the real difficulty in managing relative value positions and trading relative

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,700
value is actually managing the book. Okay. That's,

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,260
that's actually the hardest part, um, in relative value trading and you know,

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,640
a lot of the times, if your account's smaller,

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,250
you really just want to trade one side of the market. Um,

21
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,360
and do I explain what you mean by that? So imagine guys,

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,780
we are looking at two ETFs. Okay. So we're trading one ETF versus another ETF.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,240
And, um, you know,

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,200
we're selling vol on let's say S and P and we're buying vol on NASDAQ. Well,

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,330
a lot of the times it's going to take a shit ton of margin to sell the straddle.

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,750
Right. And then when you do, when you buy the wings, let's say,

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,570
let's say you want to do an iron condor to make it more efficient versus long straddle.

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,530
You're kind of giving away a lot of edge there by buying the wings, right?

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,870
Like your hedge is already the NASDAQ strategy and you're overhead,

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,200
you're overhead, you're adding too much. And so, um,

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,820
we usually do straddle for straddle, strangle for strangle, um, you know,

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,040
or an out performance option,

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,180
which is just basically buying a call for this stock and then selling a call for

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,930
this stock or selling an index for that stock. Um, and so, um,

35
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,190
a lot of the time guys, you just want to be on one side of that trade.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,610
So what I mean by one side, we have two legs. Okay.

37
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,790
When a relative value share, we have two legs, but you can actually say, okay,

38
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:13,380
well, and this is called an error correcting leg. Okay. So which is,

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,920
which is going to correct, right? There's an error, right? There's an error.

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,440
So stocks, stocks go like this. Okay. And now they're like this. Well,

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
there's an error, right?

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,020
And then for those of you that took any level one stats or level two stats,

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,000
right? It's a, it's a residue, right? So we've got an error here.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,220
And so instead of trading on both sides, we might say, okay, well,

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,400
this is going to be the error correcting leg, meaning this is going to snap up,

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,570
right? It's not this going to snap down or they're going to go like this,

47
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,390
but this is going to error correct to this. And so that is most,

48
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,330
that is the way, um, a lot of you guys should be doing it, uh,

49
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,640
especially with smaller account size. Um,

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,220
and just by taking the error correcting leg, um,

51
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,400
it's usually a lot more beneficial. So for this live,

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,840
let's talk about straight up relative value, not, uh, not one leg.

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,460
And what we should do is we'll start with, um, putting on the position.

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,360
So position at inception and then position management moving forward.

55
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,520
Cause that's when it starts to get messy,

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,820
but I think it's also important to cover actually putting on the position.

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,930
Yeah. Okay. So let's jump into it.

58
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,600
So share my screen and we're going to pull up, uh, we actually,

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,200
for this whole live guys, we were going to do a, uh,

60
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,790
uh, what do you call it? A whiteboard. Uh, it's like a fake example,

61
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:39,320
a hypothetical hypothetical example. Okay. So let's say we're looking at SPY.

62
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,480
Okay. And if anyone's saying like, let me see the chat.

63
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,160
Oh, wait, sorry. Can you tell us, sorry guys,

64
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,340
can you tell us how to determine which leg we should error? Correct.

65
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,300
Let's do it at the end. Yep. So we're going to get there. Okay.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,180
Let's keep going. Okay. So we have, we have two legs here. Okay.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,620
We'll one leg is SPY.

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,100
Okay. Ah, so it is my computer that that's, that's tough. What do you mean? No,

69
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,800
I just, okay. And what's the other one? And that's accused.

70
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,700
So here we got a SPY and the cues. And so we're saying, okay,

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,030
well this relationship is out of whack. Okay. The implied vols are,

72
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,350
have gone bananas. Okay.

73
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,090
And we think eventually that the implied vols are going to come together so we can

74
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,190
come here and put on a relative value trade. And let's say, for example,

75
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,900
SMP is trading at 30%. Okay.

76
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,220
And NASDAQ is trading at let's, let's also say 30%. Okay.

77
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
These are the eyeballs implied volatility.

78
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,730
But when we actually look at the NASDAQ and the SMP,

79
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:10,680
we see that NASDAQ has a beta of 1.5 to the SMP 500. What that means is, okay.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:20,550
Is that if let's say this is negative 5%. Okay. And this is 5%. Okay.

81
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:27,440
And here we have SPY and these are the returns. Okay. And over here,

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,020
we have the NASDAQ and shouldn't call it the cues. Okay.

83
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,120
And we have negative 7.5 up here, down here.

84
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,990
Okay. And we have plus 7.5.

85
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,030
Well, what this beta is telling us is that if SMP is up 5%, well,

86
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:56,100
then the NASDAQ should be up 7.5%. And if the SMP is down 5%, well,

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,840
the NASDAQ should be down negative 7.5%. Okay.

88
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,380
And all the other returns lie along this line somewhere. Okay.

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,960
Somewhere around here. Now,

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,420
obviously we're not going to see a perfect line like this.

91
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,820
We're never going to see a perfect line like this. Unless it's,

92
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,360
unless it's the same stock, unless it's SPY versus SPY or SPY versus IVV.

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,800
There should be some type of beta and the returns will fall along this line somewhere.

94
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,780
Okay.

95
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,460
And depending on how strong the relationship between the two pairs will depend on

96
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,160
how tight it is around this, this, this line. Okay. So we have a beta of 1.5.

97
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,120
So far so good, everyone.

98
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,000
So we have a beta of 1.5. So what that means is given SMP vol,

99
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:53,170
NASDAQ should be trading at 45. Okay. How did we get that? Well, we took SMP.

100
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,390
So imagine this, what the market's saying here is the market's implied.

101
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,750
So with a relative value, I'm going to step one step back here, guys,

102
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,030
with a relative value, guys, trade, guys, we're saying one is fair value.

103
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,730
And then what is this asset relative to this being fair value? Okay.

104
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,620
That's all we're doing. So we could say it two ways.

105
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,200
SMP 500 is trading at 30 eyeball,

106
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:26,640
meaning NASDAQ eyeball should be trading at 45%. That's 30 times 1.5. Okay.

107
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,540
And why is it like that? Well, because if SMP is up 5%,

108
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,990
NASDAQ is up 1.5% on average, right? That's the beta. So SMP 30,

109
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,930
we should see NASDAQ 45, but we're seeing NASDAQ at 30.

110
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,990
So another way we could say this is given NASDAQ is 30. Well,

111
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:52,400
SMP should be trading at 22.5, right? Because 30 divided by one point. Yeah,

112
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,880
close enough. Oh, wait, wait a minute. 2020. Yeah, yeah. It's 20. Yeah.

113
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,130
Should be trading at 20, but it's trading at 30. Okay. So together, relatively,

114
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,650
if NASDAQ is fair, SMP is underpriced. If SMP is underpriced, if SMP is fair,

115
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,130
sorry, guys, sorry, sorry. If NASDAQ is fair,

116
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,710
SMP is overpriced because it's trading at 30 eyeball,

117
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:28,030
but it should be trading at 20 given NASDAQ. On the flip side, given SMP at 30,

118
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,030
NASDAQ should be trading at 45, but it's trading at 30.

119
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,590
If we determine that SMP is what's actually fair value.

120
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,500
Like if SMP is more correctly priced. Right. So if we think SMP is fair,

121
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,170
NASDAQ is cheap. If we NASDAQ is fair, SMP is expensive. Okay. So we say, okay,

122
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,930
well, there's a trade to be made here.

123
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,920
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell ball on SMP. Okay.

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,560
And we're going to go ahead and buy ball on the NAS. Right.

125
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,460
Let me think here. Cause remember, right.

126
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,960
If we come back to this graph for one second,

127
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,600
what we're actually seeing right now, right.

128
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,520
If green is what we're actually seeing, we're actually seeing this.

129
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,170
We should be seeing the red, but we're seeing the green.

130
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,570
Or at least that's implied, right?

131
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,950
The green line is what's implied right now versus the red line.

132
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:33,860
But what the market should be implying is this, these should be down there.

133
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,920
Given the fact that the beta to the SMP is 1.5 for the cues.

134
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,160
So it's almost like you're trading the implied beta versus the realized beta.

135
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,040
Okay.

136
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:55,760
So here we have, so here we have the two, the two, the two ETFs. Now,

137
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,860
in this case, we need to structure this. Okay. We need to structure this.

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,540
The best way to structure this. Okay. It's theta neutral.

139
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,480
Now there is times where we don't do that. And as time where's the other,

140
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,450
how the night goes, if we have enough time, we're going to,

141
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,250
we're going to get into it.

142
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,260
But why do we make an assumption to go theta neutral off the bat? Right.

143
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,760
And the reason why we do that is because it's stock versus stock or ETF versus ETF,

144
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,800
right? It's the same, same type of asset. So when you say theta neutral,

145
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,140
what do you mean by that? So there's data exposure, obviously, but like, why?

146
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,200
And like, what are the actual implications of that? Yes.

147
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,800
So this is a little bit hard to understand. Okay.

148
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,760
It's a little bit tough to understand,

149
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,100
but you're actually monetizing your gamma. Okay.

150
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,080
I know it's a little tough to think about, and we're going to,

151
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,960
we're going to break that down right now. Actually. Good, good call there.

152
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,340
So before we even jump into this, guys think about it like this. Okay.

153
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,350
There is two there's theta neutral and there's Vega neutral. Okay.

154
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,690
Theta neutral and Vega neutral. Now I'm actually going to, you know,

155
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,150
these are really like, you know, big term,

156
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,970
but we're actually going to simplify it. Okay.

157
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,120
Theta neutral means premium neutral. Okay.

158
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:17,420
Premium neutral Vega neutral means notional neutral. Okay.

159
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,240
So what does this mean? We're just going to, you know,

160
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
really start at the core,

161
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,330
start at the fundamental premium neutral means if I'm selling,

162
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,130
it means the extrinsic value is the same across. Okay.

163
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,850
Basically I'm going to sell $10,000 of extrinsic value here and buy $10,000 of extrinsic

164
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,700
value here. And if nothing happens,

165
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,870
I'm going to lose 10,000 and I'm going to gain 10,000. Right.

166
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,950
So I'm going to be flat so far. So good. Premium neutral, theta neutral, right?

167
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,750
Remember theta is their sensitivity is the decay to time.

168
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,720
So if these are both decaying at the same time, well,

169
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,540
they must have had the same to start with.

170
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,330
They must have the same extrinsic value to start with. Right.

171
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,850
Does that make sense?

172
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm just trying to think if there's anything I can add there to clarify it.

173
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,020
Chris. Oh my gosh, Jekka. Chris never said that. Okay.

174
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,340
Chris still wouldn't understand. I'm pretty sure you took it from Chris. No,

175
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,620
I took it from one of my mentors.

176
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,280
Chris. We're on the same page here. Yeah.

177
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,470
So yeah, like I'm just trying to think about.

178
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,430
So what you're basically saying is when you have two of the same, like,

179
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,770
let's say on your sell side, you sell $10,000 of premium.

180
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,050
If you want it to be theta neutral off inception,

181
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,690
you would buy $10,000 worth of premium on the other asset. Yes. Extrinsic.

182
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:48,790
Extrinsic. Not intrinsic. Extrinsic. Okay. So the same extrinsic premium. Yes.

183
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,430
Okay.

184
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,490
And then what you're saying is the reason that's theta neutral is let's say the

185
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,730
eyeballs don't change or anything and they,

186
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,690
but they move relative to each other. Now you'll break even correct.

187
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,090
If the only thing that changes is time, if you've, if,

188
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,870
if the premiums don't change, right. Right. One will decay to zero.

189
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,390
The other will stay at 10 K. Yeah. And you'll break even. Yes.

190
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:16,240
Hence data neutral. Correct. Got it. Now you can get a little tricky guys.

191
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,440
I hope you guys don't mind if we get a little into this. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

192
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,920
So I know, I know Steve B's going to love this one. He's probably,

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,400
he's looking at his lips right now. He's got the bottle of Vaseline out. So,

194
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,860
okay. So I want to ask you guys a question. Okay. So we've got two stocks.

195
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,820
Okay. So we've got SMP at 30 eyeball. Okay. And we got SMP too. Okay.

196
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,600
Which is the same thing as SMP. Okay. It's S it's a, it's a,

197
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,360
it's a made up ETF. Okay.

198
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:02,300
It's a made up ETF but it's the exact same thing as SMP and it's trading at 25%

199
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,440
volatility. Okay. We're gonna have to start off really basic guys.

200
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,460
So you get the, you get the assumption. Yeah. They would have a beta of one.

201
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,780
They have a beta of one,

202
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,370
but what do you guys think the theta let's say the theta is for this $10 a day.

203
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,320
Okay. Well, what's the theta for this option?

204
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,880
What would be the theta for this one? Okay. So we've got SMP trading at 30%.

205
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,460
We got SMP to trading at 25%. Okay. What would the theta for this be?

206
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,360
Okay. Well, while they come in from grabbing a glass of water,

207
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,140
my mouth is fucking dry. Okay.

208
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,900
Okay. Jacko, you want to expand on that?

209
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,660
Say less than the 30, like less than SPY one. Yeah. It'd be less.

210
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,540
Steve gave a number to be honest with you.

211
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,880
I don't know if that's the exact number. Maybe it is 8.5. It'd be close.

212
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,740
So it's going to be less than 10. The, you know,

213
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,820
it's going to be less than 10 and maybe it's 8.5. We'll call it 8.5. Okay.

214
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,400
So now I want you guys to think of this in terms of like,

215
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,840
imagine this thing existed. Okay. Which, which it doesn't. Unfortunately,

216
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,360
this would be a great trade, right? It doesn't unfortunately exist like this.

217
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,900
If you ever see this, something's wrong. Okay. Something inherently is wrong.

218
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,020
You're missing a point. And I've seen this, I've seen this across many tickers,

219
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,820
ETFs, where it looks like it's an ARB or very close to an ARB.

220
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,900
But when you factor in a whole bunch of other things that, you know,

221
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,730
a lot of people miss out, it's not, okay. It's really not.

222
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,590
And those can really be devastating. And it's happened to me before, right?

223
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:59,800
It's, it's happened to me. So this is going to have, so let's, let's rewind.

224
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,330
We've got S&P trading at 30%. Okay. IVOL,

225
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,790
it's going to have $10 in theta a day. S&P2 trading at 25% IVOL,

226
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,410
it's going to have $8.50 a day. Okay.

227
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,390
Now both of these ETFs should have a beta of one, right?

228
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,950
The beta of these two ETFs is one.

229
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:20,550
Okay.

230
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,180
What are you doing, dude? Okay. Sorry, guys. Okay. Beta equals one. Dude.

231
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,040
Now, what does that mean? Now,

232
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,700
now this is what we're talking about monetizing our gamma. Okay.

233
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:45,960
So what it means is to get theta neutral, we have to buy more of this.

234
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,480
Okay. We have to buy more of this to get theta neutral. Now,

235
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,840
before we jump into theta neutral, and slow me down guys,

236
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,580
if I'm going too fast, and this is recorded,

237
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,220
so you guys can go over it afterwards. Let's talk about vega neutral. Okay.

238
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,360
So we now know what X trend, now we now understand theta neutral, right?

239
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,470
We understand theta neutral now, but let's talk about vega neutral.

240
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,300
Okay. Man, you know, we got to get, we have to get the writing pads.

241
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,340
Like this is fucking brutal. I know. Honestly, man.

242
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,100
I swear we were good at this last week, man.

243
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,760
If I knew where you were going with it, I would just,

244
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,080
I could do it quick and I could use like the text and stuff. Okay.

245
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,820
So vega neutral. Vega neutral is notional neutral.

246
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,420
So here we have S&P trading at 100. Okay.

247
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,120
And we have S&P 2 trading at 100 because they're the same,

248
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,150
they're the same thing. So vega neutral would be notional neutral.

249
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,530
And notional neutral,

250
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,570
meaning that the dollar amount is the same in terms of what the underlying is,

251
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,210
right? So, so we would sell in a vega neutral manner,

252
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,120
we would sell one of these and buy one of those.

253
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,730
And that would be vega neutral. Okay. Because it's same notional, same vega.

254
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,200
Okay. We're good. Okay. So if we have the same vega,

255
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,860
then what we're really exposed to here is the changes in implied vol. Okay.

256
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,530
The changes of implied vol, but with theta neutral,

257
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,210
we're actually going to monetize our gamma. So here let's,

258
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,060
let's take a look here, guys. Okay. I know, I know Steve,

259
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,620
you're gonna have a lot of questions about this. Are we going to go over them?

260
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,920
Okay. So, so far we're good. Vega neutral, theta neutral. We're all good.

261
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,660
Let me know if we're not good. There's obviously going to be some questions,

262
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,100
but like just as a general concept. So here you guys are going to see this,

263
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:57,150
right? Well, take a look at this. We gotta go back even a further step. Okay.

264
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,200
So this is such a complex topic. Okay. Let's just keep it simple.

265
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,720
Let's only look at theta neutral. Yeah. No,

266
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,080
but like it's trying to explain everything. So like with the theta neutral,

267
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,940
okay. Let me know if I'm getting too ahead here, guys. Yeah.

268
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,900
There's something called the rent ratio. Okay. The rent ratio.

269
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,880
And that is your theta.

270
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,740
Okay. That's your theta over your gamma. Okay.

271
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,340
And that's called the rent ratio. Now in this case,

272
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,320
let's explain what the rent ratio is quick. Yeah.

273
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,520
It's basically remember one man's data is another man's gamma, right?

274
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,520
You get paid data because you're giving someone exposure to large moves or you are

275
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
paying gamma or you're,

276
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,400
you are paying theta in order to get that exposure to large moves.

277
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's say you're the one paying it.

278
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,000
You can think of it as you're paying rent for access to this, right?

279
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,900
Your theta is your rent for it. Well,

280
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,520
how much rent are you paying relative to the exposure you're getting?

281
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,960
That's your rent ratio, right? So in this case, okay, this right here, this,

282
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,320
this one right here, guys, the 30% eyeball is going to have a higher theta.

283
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,690
Okay. But the gamma is actually going to be the same. Okay.

284
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,030
Between this and this, the gamma is going to be the same. So this, this,

285
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,810
this asset.

286
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,330
So the reason why the gamma will be the same is even though they're implying different,

287
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,870
they're the same asset. If one moves 5%, the other moves 5%,

288
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,710
the actual moves for them is equal.

289
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,420
The only reason the thetas are going to be different is because they have different

290
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,750
implied volatilities right now, right?

291
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,110
Which means the market is implying that it's going to give you access to more,

292
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,930
but it's really the same, right? It's going to have more extrinsic value.

293
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,470
So it's got to lose more by the end of the expiration,

294
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:02,180
but the stocks are going to move the same. So here we have, let's say, um, our,

295
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,490
our, our theta gamma ratio for, for asset one for stuff, for SPY-1. Okay.

296
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,980
It's going to be, let's say 1.5. Fuck the numbers. Okay.

297
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,020
It's going to be higher than this one. Okay.

298
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,490
It's going to be higher than this one. So when we go theta neutral,

299
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,310
all of a sudden we are,

300
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,290
so here is asset one and here's theta gamma ratio for asset two. Okay.

301
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,270
These are going to be the same,

302
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,050
but the gamma is going to be much higher on asset two.

303
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,490
So now you are theta neutral, but you're exposed to long gamma, right?

304
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,650
You're monetizing that long gamma. That's what's really making the money here,

305
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,670
right? The money is being made when stock one goes from, let's say,

306
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,950
SPY-1 goes from 10, moves up 10% and this moves up 10%. You just,

307
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:59,010
you were long gamma on this, more gamma on this than you were this. Okay.

308
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,390
So we're going to, we're going to,

309
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,540
we're going to circle back down and we're going to start doing, going back to,

310
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,200
maybe we should actually stick with SPY-2 because it's simple. Yeah.

311
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,840
I think it's good. But Ned's just asking, so if the vols were both 30%,

312
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,080
they'd have a rent ratio of one. No, they would just have the same rent ratio,

313
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,780
right? The ratio of the ratio would be one.

314
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,090
So, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to delete this for now guys,

315
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,150
because we don't, we don't really need this. We need to,

316
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,990
we need to work with simple numbers for us to really get a sense of this because

317
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,980
doing it against the NASDAQ makes it a lot more complex.

318
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,270
Okay. So now what do we do? Well, we go into the market. Okay.

319
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,540
And we sell 10 straddles or strangles. Okay. We're going to say,

320
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,630
we're going to call it straddles for now. Okay. We sell 10 straddles.

321
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,590
Do you want to, do you want to type in this man? Yeah.

322
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,650
As long as it's something straightforward, I can follow what you're doing.

323
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,520
10 straddles. So what are we doing? We're going to sell 10 straddles. On what?

324
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,570
SPY2. SPY1. Okay. So we sell 10 straddles SPY1.

325
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,400
And now let's say we collect $10,000 in premium.

326
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,090
Okay. Well, now we're going to take that 10 grand.

327
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,410
We're going to go buy straddles on SPY2.

328
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,110
Here's the beauty though. The straddles on SPY1,

329
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,990
because they're trading at a higher implied vol, are trading at, let's say $10.

330
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,930
SPY1 straddles are trading for $10.

331
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,560
SPY2 straddles, because it's a cheaper implied vol, is only trading for $7.50.

332
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:13,480
So we now own 100 short straddles on SPY1. We own,

333
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:20,910
let's say 150 long straddles on SPY2.

334
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,630
The thetas are the same. Okay. Are you guys with me so far?

335
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:34,180
The thetas are the same. So every time the stock moves, we make money.

336
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,480
And that's why it's called monetizing power gamma.

337
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,580
Questions? Thoughts? I was hoping this was going to be a short live.

338
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,540
It's going to turn to a three hour live. It's going to be a nine o'clock.

339
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:02,320
Right. Net. So obviously if the spread collapses, right, let's say tomorrow,

340
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:10,320
the S&P, the vols collapse. And now the thetas are the same. Right.

341
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,660
And so we wouldn't want to stay in the position, we'd exit the position,

342
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,920
our money has been made. Okay.

343
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,120
You know, so either this vol can increase, or this vol can decrease.

344
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,440
But once the vols collapse, there's no more edge, we're out of the position.

345
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,890
And then Ned saying, do we scalp theta to hold the position?

346
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,470
So we never really scalp the theta, it's we scalp the gamma.

347
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,270
And so that's another thing, right? scalping gammas, delta hedging, okay,

348
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,830
is actually a tool that's used to reduce your directional exposure. Okay?

349
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,390
If you think, for example, Ned, that the stock is just going to chop, chop,

350
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,120
chop, chop, chop like this. Well,

351
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,060
then you want to be scalping as much as possible.

352
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,780
But if you think it's going to trend, well, you don't want to scalp at all,

353
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,140
you want to let that thing ride out. Okay, also scalping is also expensive.

354
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,340
Okay, cool, we can maybe do that towards the end.

355
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,480
If you add the element of them being different assets,

356
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,720
it just makes it more complicated.

357
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,640
Because what we're trying to do by saying spy one and spy two is it is that they

358
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,920
move the same, right?

359
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,520
It's not like they have different underlying assets as a part of the ETFs.

360
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,120
They're the same ETFs. They're just implying different things in the market.

361
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,110
Can we take advantage of it? And how would we go about doing it?

362
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,310
Was that a question? Yeah, I just answered. Okay. Steve had a good point.

363
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,060
Why don't we do these Vega neutral?

364
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:52,000
And see, to be honest, I think you're coming from a different perspective.

365
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,940
Okay, and I won't share on the live, but if you want to send me a message,

366
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,840
we can talk about it.

367
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,950
But there's a reason why you wouldn't do Vega neutral here.

368
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,660
And there is a reason why we would do Vega neutral here as well. Okay,

369
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,040
let's say for example,

370
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,080
you think that the implied vols of asset of spy one are going to increase,

371
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,640
or sorry, spy two is going to decrease. Okay,

372
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,680
so we have right now we're like this, sorry, we're like this, spy one, spy two.

373
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:31,490
And if we do Vega neutral, okay, and this increases, well,

374
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,070
we would have been better off if we did data neutral and this increased,

375
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:41,440
because we have more of these. But if we think this is the expensive leg, okay,

376
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,780
let's say we think this is the expensive leg. Then when this decreases, right,

377
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,820
we're going to make more money if we have more size here.

378
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,440
So that's one reason why we would do Vega neutral. And this is like, oh, man,

379
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,860
yeah, we're gonna get too deep. Yeah, yeah, we gotta slow down. Yeah. Steve,

380
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,100
send me a message. Yeah, we'll get back.

381
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,580
I think I know where you're coming from as well. And what you're trying to do.

382
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,760
So just send me a message and we can chat about. Okay,

383
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,960
so just because we got a little off track. Let's recap what we've done so far.

384
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,420
And then let's continue on this example. We have two assets,

385
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,480
spy one and spy two, call them whatever you want. The whole point is,

386
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,680
they are the same thing. Okay, they move exactly the same.

387
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,070
They're the same company, let's say, for a co-op,

388
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:28,520
we'll say it's Tesla one and Tesla two, okay. Or we can bug them and be like,

389
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,880
it's Tesla and NIO.

390
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,640
The only thing that's different about them is when we look at the market,

391
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,940
we see that asset spy one has an implied volatility of 30,

392
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,140
when spy two has an implied volatility of 25. But they're the same thing,

393
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,680
they should have the same implied vols.

394
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,280
So how can we structure a trade here to take advantage of it? Well,

395
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,430
we start off by saying,

396
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,610
do you want to explain that this part just because I'm not sure how you went from

397
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,950
here to here for the rent ratio? Oh, yeah. Okay. So we're,

398
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,790
what we're saying is,

399
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,080
the rent ratio in this asset is going to be more expensive than this asset.

400
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,620
So we're basically flattening them. Okay.

401
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,900
And that's your theta over your gamma, right?

402
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,280
So how much rent are you paying for exposure to gamma,

403
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,400
because you should be paying the same, right?

404
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,940
They're going to have the same likelihood of big moves,

405
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,130
and the big moves will be the same for them. So why are you raising this?

406
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,070
I was gonna move this up and then we can keep it going. Yeah,

407
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,080
just just while I'm explaining. So what we're gonna say is,

408
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,200
is there a way we can make the rent ratios equal for them. And then we have,

409
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:44,460
you can hopefully collect, basically what we're doing here is we're monetizing,

410
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,880
monetizing the long gamma, right? Because we have more of it now. It's like,

411
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,860
we just sold two properties, the exact same properties,

412
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,260
one we're collecting higher rent on than the other one,

413
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,300
we're collecting higher rent on the other. So this one was going for 10 bucks,

414
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,620
this one was going for 850, we said, so what we could do is we sell 10,

415
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,820
that 10 straddles on spy one, and we collect 10k for it,

416
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,760
then we take the 10k that we collected,

417
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,500
and we buy $10,000 worth of straddles on spy two.

418
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,820
So the reason we're theta neutral here is the premium,

419
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,450
we're equal amounts of premium in both short 10,000 here,

420
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,960
long 10,000 in premium here of extrinsic. Does that make sense?

421
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,430
Right? So now, we are short straddles on spy one,

422
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,170
and we are long more straddles on spy two, but they have the same theta,

423
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,250
meaning they decay at the same rate.

424
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,940
Right? So let's make sure that we're clear on why they decay at the same rate.

425
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,510
It's because one decays quicker than the other, right?

426
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:59,220
Spy one decays quicker than spy two. But we have more of spy two,

427
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,180
so that the actual dollar decay per day is the same for both of them relative to

428
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,280
the premium that we either bought or sold.

429
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,620
Okay, let's keep moving here because we should stay on track with this. Okay,

430
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,700
so Bala, we're gonna get back to that afterwards. Okay,

431
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,240
so we're gonna clear this up. Yeah. So we're gonna get rid of the top part.

432
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,140
Yeah. So now we have our position on. Okay, we got our position now,

433
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,280
everything's good. And now things start to move. Do you want me to keep typing?

434
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,680
Yeah. So now things start to move. Okay. Now, because we're long more gamma,

435
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,920
right? Think about this, guys. We're long more gamma,

436
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,220
we have more straddles in asset two on the same ETI.

437
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,780
When we start moving in one direction, we're gonna pick up more deltas.

438
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,260
So at inception, we're delta flat. Yeah. And delta neutral as well.

439
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,400
Now, in time step one, tomorrow, the stock moves 5%. Okay,

440
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,400
so now we're gonna be long delta, right? We have more straddles.

441
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,520
So we're gonna pick up long delta. And this is where things get messy, right?

442
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,420
This is where managing the book, it's extremely messy.

443
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,020
Because not only now are we long more delta, we're potentially long more theta.

444
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,920
Okay. So, you know, when I first started out, I say, okay, well,

445
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,120
let me just rebalance. Let me just close it out, rebalance.

446
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,340
And that's actually so pricey. It's super, super pricey,

447
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,480
especially when you start trading size, and you can go a little more liquid,

448
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,000
things get super pricey.

449
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,860
So what you need to do is you need to buy an option that offset or sell an option

450
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,630
that offsets this. And this can get very, very tricky. Okay,

451
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,790
because think about it like this.

452
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,720
You are long, let's say the 100 strike call, or straddle,

453
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,400
and you're short the 100 strike straddle on SPY2.

454
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:11,070
Okay, so we're short and long the 100 at inception, the stock's at 110. Okay,

455
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,610
if we buy a 100 strike call, let's say to offset our delta and our theta,

456
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,900
we might not be able to manage the position, we might not have enough theta,

457
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,460
let's say on that in the money call.

458
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,110
So we let's say now have to go buy a 110 call.

459
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,990
So now we have two straddles and a 110 call.

460
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:37,430
And then it moves again. Right? And now we go have to go buy something else.

461
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,820
And so we end up having this book, where we have all bits and pieces,

462
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,670
all chunks going on here to create this relative value position.

463
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,430
It doesn't actually end there. Because this is the only time guys,

464
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,660
this is the only time I will ever say third order Greeks matter. Okay,

465
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,380
this is the only time because you're let's say the 110 call that you just bought

466
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,290
is decaying at a different theta than your 100 strike straddle.

467
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,060
And your delta is now decaying at a different rate.

468
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,430
So managing these positions can get extremely, extremely complex.

469
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,550
And to be honest, we don't have the time to do this in a 20 minute session,

470
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,710
or 20 minutes from now,

471
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,070
we could do like down the road an entire weekend on relative value,

472
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:35,430
we could do a whole weekend, we could do that. Or when you guys at 100 members,

473
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:41,190
we'll do it, we'll do a weekend. Yeah. Long, in depth, relative value session.

474
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,650
Yeah, we're even when we get the new terminal,

475
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,750
and the guy started showing ideas, we can and we put on a position,

476
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,360
we can manage it with the group. That'd be kind of cool. That'd be a good one.

477
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,720
So as you guys can see, like, it gets very complex.

478
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,670
And I'm just trying to think how we should go about talking about this.

479
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,910
We do like a theoretical example.

480
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,070
It's tricky. I think I can do this quick. Quick. Okay.

481
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:17,350
So we're long 10 100 straddles. Okay. And we're short or sorry, we're long 15.

482
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,670
We're long 15 100 strike straddles. If the guys fall asleep,

483
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,890
like during these like rants, we go on sometimes.

484
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,320
Let me know if you guys are sleeping. We sure don't think they can sleep.

485
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:41,690
No one responds in there. Okay. We short 10 100 strike straddles. Okay.

486
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:48,650
And spot is trading at 100. This is our initial position. Now,

487
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:55,930
tomorrow spot moves to 105. We're going more, we'll go 110. Okay. Well,

488
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,030
we just made a shit ton. Right?

489
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,050
We just made a shit ton because our long 15 straddles are making way more than our

490
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:08,250
short 10 straddles. Okay. Now, the thing is, though, the spread is still there.

491
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,520
Okay, we can't be moving these positions like crazy. The spread is still there.

492
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,170
So what we do is we look at our new position. Maybe we are long 200 deltas.

493
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,630
And we are now short. Well, yeah, we'll say we're now short 50 deltas. Sorry,

494
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,670
50 thetas. Sorry, sorry.

495
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,620
So what do we do? Well, in this position,

496
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:51,080
we have to go out and basically sell 200 deltas. And whoops.

497
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,120
In short, and get long 50 thetas.

498
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,040
So what we might do is we might sell a call option.

499
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,100
So why do we need to do this? So okay, right. So yeah,

500
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,380
we put the position on where exactly the exposures we want. Stock moves,

501
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,940
we make money in some places a little somewhere else. Well,

502
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,760
we now have these other exposures. Yeah,

503
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,540
we want to keep the position on because it was a it was a big move in the stock

504
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,760
that generated our income, but there's still a spread,

505
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,580
we still actually have the same view.

506
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,920
So we need to go out and we need to return to our original view.

507
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,920
But why can't we take this? Yeah,

508
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,200
why can't we have the 200 delta exposure and the 50 thetas? Well,

509
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,880
it's just like any other trade, right? And like any other trade,

510
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,740
where do you want this 200 deltas and long, long or short?

511
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,620
Along these 500 thetas? Do we want that? Right? And if the answer is no,

512
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,200
we don't want that. Well, we have to offset it, right?

513
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,220
Because if the stock goes back down tomorrow, but we just lost our gains,

514
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,900
and we weren't able to monetize in our gamma.

515
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,920
So what we will do is we'll go and buy, let's say a put option,

516
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,740
which offsets our short data, our long theta,

517
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,200
and also gives us our short delta.

518
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:17,110
But this put option is not going to be the 100 put anymore. Okay,

519
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:22,280
it's going to be maybe something like the 110 put, right?

520
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,980
And the reason that is, is because if you go way out of the money, guys,

521
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,540
your delta is low, but your theta is still high, right?

522
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,420
The delta theta ratio starts to increase as you go out of the money, right?

523
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,510
So we have to find the right strike,

524
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,950
it's going to be able to offset and offset this the cheapest way possible.

525
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,660
Okay, and that is what that's what you that's what you end up doing.

526
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,580
And let's say you have this position on for 30 days, right? And you're hedging,

527
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,100
let's say every two days, every three days, well, this can get costly,

528
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,900
this can get you end up with a book,

529
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,260
that's a whole bunch of different strikes all over the place. Right?

530
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,140
And this is a simple example. This is an unrealistic example,

531
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,580
where we have two things that are the same,

532
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,500
trading at the vastly different vols,

533
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,260
and no other reason to justify those vastly different vols. In reality,

534
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,040
we're doing S&P versus NASDAQ. Well,

535
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,140
now we have to consider our beta in our deltas, right,

536
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:31,040
and our beta in our thetas. So if let's say we pick up long 100 thetas in S&P,

537
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,510
well, we have to make sure that we only have 66 deltas in the cubes. Otherwise,

538
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,270
we're leaning.

539
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,270
Okay, so that's why I don't recommend anybody in this group to do this,

540
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,230
at least at first. You think for a taste of relative value,

541
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,780
they could maybe do in the delta one space? Ah, it's so different.

542
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,860
It's so yeah, yeah, yeah. So different with the with the other Greeks. I mean,

543
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,620
you guys can do like, like if here's trading for Yeah, to see what it's like,

544
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,420
right? That's what I'm kind of talking. Oh, yeah. But managing the position,

545
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,480
it's gonna get tricky, I guess, way trickier in in the option space.

546
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,380
Like simple things, they could they could do an out performance thing. Like,

547
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,560
you know, Tico was joking around, I think, but he's like,

548
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:23,740
my dreams finally come true. I can be long Tesla short S&P. Right? Right.

549
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,420
And then things guys, you can do one side, you can just do one side,

550
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,280
you don't have to do both sides. Right? This is it's not first off,

551
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,260
it's not margin efficient.

552
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,940
It's the first thing it's not it's more when you have more size, and you do,

553
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,280
let's say, increase your sharp ratio,

554
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,820
that you should not be doing that in your in your scenarios.

555
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,630
You want to trade the one leg. Okay, now,

556
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,630
they'll drive up there'll be another reason for, you know,

557
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:59,070
finding out which market is the most likely to be efficient. Okay,

558
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,060
is it is it the S&P? Or is it the NASDAQ? Right?

559
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,740
If you're trading to the liquidity, one, one liquid ETF, and one liquid ETF?

560
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,180
Well, all this is pretty easy, right? Yeah. Okay.

561
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,690
Right. So maybe we can give them the example of when we were trading,

562
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,570
what was it? IWM and Q's?

563
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,900
Is that IWM? IWM and Q's? For what?

564
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,400
When we were at we had a relative value trade on? I think this was during?

565
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,860
Yeah, we did. We did it multiple times. Yeah, we did multiple times.

566
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,520
You guys don't want to go check out our 100k challenge we did multiple times.

567
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,360
And we paid out huge is one of the reasons why we stayed afloat during that during

568
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,700
that week.

569
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,930
So a couple things, we're going to answer a couple questions now.

570
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,970
I hope that didn't discourage any of you. This is just like,

571
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,170
so this is high five. Maybe what we'll do is, you know,

572
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,590
there's only a couple questions. So we'll see five minutes at the end for it.

573
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,970
We'll go straight right to nine this time.

574
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,010
Maybe let's talk for a second about like,

575
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,750
just where these guys can start with it. Right?

576
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,970
There's a lot of interest in the group about it. Yeah,

577
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:07,100
that this is actually a gold topic. This is not a silver topic. But you know,

578
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,220
we wanted to chat about it. So you know, there's, there's, you know,

579
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,740
even before like, all of last week's lives were about relative value.

580
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,590
So let's talk about trading one leg and managing that and what you should look for

581
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,430
in that. Yeah.

582
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,530
So at the end of the day, guys, if we're doing it, one leg, we're just saying,

583
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,720
okay, implied vol should be here, given, given this information,

584
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,630
given that S&P is usually the liquid leg,

585
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,170
and it's usually the it's usually the most margin efficient leg.

586
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,000
And that is the that is the estimated forecast, right? At the end of the day,

587
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,760
guys, we want to we're trying to we're trying to say this is cheap.

588
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,690
Because our forecast is different. Right? Our forecast is different.

589
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,670
So if we have something that's super liquid and super smart and super sophisticated

590
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,110
saying, this is what eyeball should be.

591
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,300
And we have another something else saying no, it shouldn't. Right? Well,

592
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,900
obviously, and we can say, Okay, well, this might be the less efficient way.

593
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,860
So maybe we'll say is to start off,

594
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:27,910
maybe we'll say is this find? Yeah, so charger as well.

595
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,460
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, we're almost out.

596
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:38,020
So we'll say this find pairs of ETFs where one is liquid is extremely liquid.

597
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,730
And the other is not right. So one pair that we looked at,

598
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:51,090
I think it was I WM versus qqq. Right? SPY versus, you know,

599
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,790
put in another one here. Right? So go find pairs,

600
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,530
where you have like a super efficient asset,

601
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,590
and something a little less efficient. And then look at how they move together,

602
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,650
right? Look at what they're implying. Go look at what they're made up of,

603
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,690
right? So they might be carrying, you know, 80% of the same assets,

604
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,010
meaning they should move very, very similarly. So Jordan,

605
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:15,630
I'm just recommending here, the guys go, and they find pairs of ETFs,

606
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,470
that where one is extremely liquid, and the other sort of follows it,

607
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,630
but it's less liquid. Yeah. And actually, guys,

608
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,850
that's actually where a lot of the edges made is like,

609
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:31,640
understanding the makeup of these ETFs. So you got one ETF,

610
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,380
where it should be made up of, you know, recently,

611
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,780
this ETF recently got very similar,

612
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,120
picked up a lot of very similar equities to this, right? And now,

613
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,830
but the balls haven't changed yet. Right?

614
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,350
It's those things is where you really find it's not going to be like S&P IVV.

615
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,760
Right? You're not going to see that it's too obvious, right?

616
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,980
It'll be too small to be worth it. Right?

617
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,430
Again, they want to find things that are not obvious, really not obvious.

618
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:07,040
Right? And those are the positions you want to find yourself in. Okay?

619
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,480
It's too obvious, it's not going to be there, unfortunately.

620
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,130
Okay, so what we'll do now, so that's where you can start, go find these pairs,

621
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,950
go take a look at them. And bring them to the group,

622
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,210
we'll start chatting about them. I think that's the best place to start,

623
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,130
go do some research, bring it to the group,

624
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,510
ask questions about what you're seeing. And we'll go from there.

625
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,750
So we have a couple questions that we'll go through.

626
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,630
And then we're going to wrap it up. Because, once again,

627
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,150
as all these lives end, I'm getting hungry.

628
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,340
So let's see, where was Bala's question?

629
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,190
Oh, wait, Bala left. So Oh, he's out. Oh, no, there he is.

630
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,230
I was looking for Bala not Siddharth. So at the top of the list. Okay,

631
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:51,690
let me see.

632
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,040
I'm not seeing it. Bala, do you mind retyping?

633
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Is it possible for the IV spread to reduce but still not make money on the trade?

634
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,740
Where can we go wrong? No. So okay, yeah.

635
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,020
So you could go wrong where let's say, well, if the implied vol reduces, right,

636
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,180
if it goes back to normal, then you would make money, right?

637
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,320
Nothing would happen there.

638
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,660
But there would be the case where the stock just like,

639
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,360
where one stock moves like crazy, and the other stock doesn't. Like remember,

640
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,140
in our example, they're the exact same, but in real life, they're not.

641
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,940
And I've seen some.

642
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,980
One second.

643
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,270
Yeah, I've seen some times where it's like,

644
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,610
you think these ETFs are correlated,

645
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:56,440
and then and then they end up not being or, for example, a current so okay,

646
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,060
so here's a good one, too, is like a currency, right? So you might have like,

647
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,720
let's say two similar things trading on different exchanges.

648
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,090
And then you would have the currency vol, right? People will be like, Oh,

649
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,430
you know, this is this doctrine for this. And this is the same thing,

650
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,390
just different exchange. You know, I could sell vol here and buy vol here.

651
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,290
But what they're forgetting is the currency, the currency vol that's embedded,

652
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,510
right? Or the correlation to the currency that's embedded.

653
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,430
So these are the types of things that you know,

654
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,510
you really got to make sure what you're doing,

655
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,950
you really got to understand the product, right?

656
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,610
And they're not going to be like, right out there.

657
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,930
They're not going to you're not gonna be like, Oh, this is the you know,

658
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,250
this is right there. It's actually not going to be the case. Okay,

659
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,970
you they're going to be really subtle things that you pick up on and you guys are

660
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,210
gonna get better with this that you can they can grab.

661
00:47:52,080 --> 00:48:00,270
Did that answer it? Did I answer it? Yeah, I think so. All right, here,

662
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,750
let's go through one more question. So Jack has question right down there.

663
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,570
There's a couple on the way here.

664
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,630
Okay. And if we miss your question, guys, rewrite it, and I will,

665
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,650
we'll get back to it. So, so they're saying,

666
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,710
let's say two illiquid ETFs bank ETF and nifty index.

667
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,480
Ideal to stick with nifty to be at fair value, most likely, right, most likely,

668
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,700
but then at the same time, because it's the big index,

669
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,810
that might be a little bit overpriced. Right?

670
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,150
So you really got to you really got to look into these things.

671
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,020
Okay, that's it, which I said, would we be managing this the same way?

672
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,020
If with another underlying,

673
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,120
like if we do a relative value trade with between a 30 DTE option and a 90 DTD option?

674
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,940
Like a calendar? Yeah, on the same stock. Okay, so we did a calendar spread,

675
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,100
what we managed the same. It really depends. So in our work example,

676
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,740
I don't know if you fell asleep already, but we actually did that data neutral,

677
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,060
right? We actually went flat gamma. But you can do them vega neutral as well,

678
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,100
which would be a regular calendar spread.

679
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,130
Marcos, how do you close out positions,

680
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,270
you close out when the implied vol spread collapses,

681
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,310
or you can find a better opportunity somewhere else.

682
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:33,630
This is a gold topic. No wonder he wore a gold shirt. Exactly. Come on, guys.

683
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,270
Not saying is the beta consistent throughout the trade?

684
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,060
The answer is not always right.

685
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,860
You could have these ETFs moving like crazy or the stocks moving like crazy together.

686
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,210
Let's say beta of two, and then eventually they just stop.

687
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,840
And then last question,

688
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,200
have you ever done a trade where SPY was mispriced compared to another ETF,

689
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,660
where SPY was actually the weak leg? Yeah,

690
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,660
the SPY is usually a little bit overpriced, right?

691
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,380
SPY is actually usually a little bit overpriced.

692
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,830
So usually I don't want to do that data neutral,

693
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,850
I'm usually leaning a little more vega neutral.

694
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,630
Just because I know that that S&P leg is usually the overpriced leg.

695
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,370
Marcos is asking,

696
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,970
could the correlation change over like a really short period of time?

697
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,580
100%. 100%, right? You just don't want to find yourself in those situations.

698
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,360
You want to be pretty confident that this relationship is going to last.

699
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,860
And it should be there for a fundamental reason.

700
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,480
You guys should never take a trade just because it's been correlated, right?

701
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,400
It's got to be a fundamental reason why these are correlated.

702
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,680
Steve's saying, imagine the USO trade. Steve,

703
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,900
want to elaborate a little bit there? They should never last?

704
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,940
Yeah, exactly, right? The relationship only lasts if they're half Asian,

705
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,720
exactly.

706
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:13,890
Yeah, exactly, right? So I'm 100% sure, I didn't go back to it,

707
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:18,390
but I'm sure you could. XLE versus USO, or even guys. So here's a good one too,

708
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:18,630
right?

709
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,570
Here's a really subtle one that maybe not a lot of people would have picked up on.

710
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,960
And actually would have been like almost an arbitrage. You get an ETF,

711
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:34,520
let's say, going from 3x to 2x, you already have a 2x leveraged ETF, right?

712
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,340
And as soon as this, let's say oil 3x, oil 2x.

713
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,420
Did they announce this is going from 3x to 2x? And these aren't matching,

714
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,360
right? And these are subtle differences that need to be adjusted quickly,

715
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,960
right? And sometimes you might get an hour, two hours,

716
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,320
a day before they fully collapse.

717
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,360
And we talked about something like that before, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

718
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,520
yeah.

719
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,950
All right. That is going to do it for tonight's live.

720
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:07,150
Good seeing everyone here. Siddharth,

721
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,450
it was a pleasure having you on the live with us today, man.

722
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,050
So for those of you that don't know, Siddharth lives in India.

723
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:16,970
He's an absolute rock star in the academy. He's basically taking PA principles,

724
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,790
doing a bunch of coding on his own,

725
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,510
building models for the Indian market and absolutely crushing it.

726
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:28,030
So it's always good when he comes out of the dark, the Indian wizard.

727
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,420
Happy Diwali, my friend. Okay. Take it easy, everyone. See you guys.
