1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,390
Some of you guys are really gonna enjoy this one. All right so You know,

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,650
we always talk about like you should find out if there's evidence, right?

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,630
You should find out like does this strategy work over time, right?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,950
Especially for the technical guys here.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,570
So There are really two things With that we can look at trading right one way is

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,520
is this asset mispriced? so for example, if if I'm selling you this phone,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:35,000
okay for 500 bucks in Imperfect condition right in the box and you go online and

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,180
they're all selling for $1,500.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,670
Well,

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,200
this is probably mispriced right and the way you figure out if this is mispriced

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,900
is You look at the specs, right you say, okay.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,020
Let me see the condition Let me see if this is actually real you do your research

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,580
right who the seller is etc Then you find out this phone is actually mispriced.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,230
That's what happens a lot of times in Option trading right, you know,

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,740
you look at you find the option here and you say well it's implying a volatility

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:15,700
of 50% and You know given hits historical returns or historical Last hundred days,

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,460
let's say or not last hundred days.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,580
Let's say two years It's only moved this much and all the other sectors are moving

19
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,060
this much.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,090
So this is probably overpriced or underpriced That's a lot what we do we find mispricings,

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,910
but then there's another side Okay, there's this data science field.

22
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,770
So that is just like knowing your asset pricing your asset then there's this data

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,700
science field where it's like Well,

24
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,740
can I find something that predicts the future?

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,440
Can I kind of predict the future? Right given this information, right?

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,400
Let's think about we're the weatherman Given this information.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,760
Can I predict what tomorrow's weather is gonna be?

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:00,880
Okay given People coming into Amazon Can I predict what they're gonna buy right

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,600
and that is a whole field in itself and it's another way to look at trading Sorry,

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,580
I said my screens a little dirty here.

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm sure So do you guys understand that do you have any questions about that there's

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,160
really two methods to look at trading Okay,

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,620
like two two ways to approach the market.

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,900
You guys have any questions about that?

35
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,210
So we have the mispricing and then we have the forecasting two different approaches

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,250
Is that basically sums up all? Professional trading these days.

37
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:55,490
Yeah all of it And most of the time in options, we are finding a mispricing,

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,270
right? This assets price at this but it should be priced over here.

39
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,430
We saw we know in the in the In the USO example,

40
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,890
you know Sean I always go back to it Given the contango.

41
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,680
It shouldn't be it shouldn't be priced like this And to a lesser degree that's what

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,640
we're doing with VIX Right, it's obviously it's not as extreme. Otherwise,

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,820
we'd be piling in a lot heavier,

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,260
but it's the same concept same concept So do you guys have any questions about that?

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,890
It seems pretty quiet right now Because I'll go over it again.

46
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,750
Looks like we're good.

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,790
I've never put these guys to sleep in first eight minutes crazy Okay,

48
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,000
I see contangle contangle on individual securities same way right same way all it

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,360
means is The the market's implying more volatility in the future,

50
00:03:51,100 --> 00:04:01,270
right and If it's too much, well you can you want to sell that right? Okay,

51
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,120
so we understand that now when we come when it comes to forecasting some of the

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
times we can actually use technical indicators,

53
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,700
but we have to do a Quantitative driven approach an evidence-based approach.

54
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,530
So I highly recommend All of you go and read the book evidence-based technical analysis

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,860
Because what the author does and he's a he's one of my favorite traders of all time.

56
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,910
Okay, his name is David Aronson What the author does is he says,

57
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:37,310
okay this this method of technical analysis where you're just you're just You know,

58
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,690
you're you're just using your mind and and you're just thinking about it and rationing

59
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,970
about it is garbage And what he does is he says, okay. Well,

60
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,920
let's take an evidence-based approach Okay,

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,480
so that's what we're gonna be talking about right now and building your own strategy

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,500
right obviously or not Maybe obviously but it's gonna require some work Everything

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,780
good in life requires some work.

64
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,990
So Here's actually one of the articles from David Aronson. Okay,

65
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,870
where he actually goes about talks about how to build a strategy Okay,

66
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,720
and what we see here is on the left axis He has the stock return in a day.

67
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,110
Sorry on the y-axis On the y-axis,

68
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:25,280
he has the stock return the next day on the x-axis. He has the RSI level Okay,

69
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,780
so this is a theoretical example,

70
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,820
but what can we what can we see from this graph? What is this graph telling us?

71
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Someone want to tell me what this graph tells us?

72
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,980
Cool. Let me let me check my phone. Actually.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,940
I do not recall I Do not recall that chat I mean I'll have to take a look at it

74
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,620
before the live ends and Koa, we made a trade on VXX today.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,160
If you look in the PA trade journal in the discord You'll get a full breakdown of

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,560
what we did.

77
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,880
So Koa is right. There's an inverse versus RSI So, what does that mean Koa?

78
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,080
Can you just go one step further? What does that mean that there's an inverse?

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,240
I was pretty quiet. The answer is actually on the screen. Oh, is it?

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,930
Yeah, so Okay,

81
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,490
perfect cause so what it was saying is the higher the RSI Then if you know if the

82
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,730
RSI is high today tomorrow's return is gonna likely be low And if the RSI is low,

83
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,080
then tomorrow's return is likely to be high, right?

84
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,130
That is You know a mean reversion strategy, right?

85
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:59,880
You basically want to Buy when the stock's low sell when the stock's high and that's

86
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,290
what he's doing here. He's graphing that relationship It's evidence-based.

87
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,610
It's empirical. Okay,

88
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:17,480
so what I did Was I did an RSI strategy on so if that's a load,

89
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,030
sorry guys Okay, I didn't RSI strategy on IBM Okay,

90
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:33,300
and what I did was if our side goes above 70 Sell IBM and if it goes below 30 by

91
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:41,760
IBM and this is over 10 years I plugged it into the computer and the computer did

92
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,840
Thousands of trades and now we can see our P&L curve. How have we done?

93
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,760
Right,

94
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,460
the blue line here guys is the number of shares that I currently own The green line

95
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,220
is my P&L.

96
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,110
The red line is my drawdown and then this orange line is the RSI It's our side three

97
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,250
day and you can see like the strategy doesn't do good.

98
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,340
But this is taking an evidenced evidence-based approach Okay,

99
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:24,670
so I'm just gonna pull it up here super quick Sorry guys,

100
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:51,770
give me one quick second Okay

101
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:08,010
Here we go, perfect So here we actually have the data, right? We say okay.

102
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,890
Well, what are what are we trading? Well in this case,

103
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,210
we're trading the close Okay,

104
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:19,720
and every time the RSI goes below 30 we get a signal to buy right if it goes above

105
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,570
70 We're gonna get a signal to sell and we're just gonna go over and over and over

106
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,550
in the compute Oops,

107
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,940
and the computers gonna do this over Over and over and over again,

108
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,080
there's no hindsight bias.

109
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,060
There's not there's just what would have happened over a given period of time now

110
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,730
We can see this we can see now. Let's let's step back for a second. Okay,

111
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:56,500
and let's take a look at this strategy Okay,

112
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:07,750
just just take a look at this painting for a second Now imagine your boss said hey,

113
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,980
I want you to go out and trade this koa I want you to go and trade the strategy

114
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,600
and you had a couple winning trades Well,

115
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,850
would you let's say you had ten trades in a row? Okay,

116
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,890
you saw this and your boss said you know what?

117
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,790
It's actually a good negative correlation to one of our other strategies I want

118
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,370
you to trade this and You got ten trades in a row that were correct.

119
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,080
You were like, let's say going on this hot streak right here Okay,

120
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,620
nice big hot streak. How would you guys feel?

121
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:50,530
I want you to please comment down below How would you feel as a trader good?

122
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,900
You feel good What else what else how else would you feel how else would you feel

123
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,960
like put yourself in this position? Okay,

124
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,760
you just you just you just did the back test and your boss said go to go do it Marco

125
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,820
said confident Graham said on my 11th. I'm betting the whole company Okay,

126
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:16,940
we feel confident guys Why would we feel confident here?

127
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,580
I'm very curious to know why would we feel confident here?

128
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,640
Why would you feel good? You got ten trades in a row. Why would you feel good?

129
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,930
We're winning correct That is correct, but we gotta go deeper right?

130
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,830
We've seen what what the strategy has done,

131
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:52,970
right? Okay So the answer is we wouldn't feel anything. We wouldn't feel good.

132
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:59,300
We wouldn't feel bad The reason we wouldn't feel good is because we know that in

133
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,940
the long run.

134
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,260
We're still gonna break even we're just on a hot streak So we shouldn't feel good

135
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,390
because we know in the future. It's gonna come back down, right?

136
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:15,510
We know it's not gonna continue and we don't feel bad because we know this strategy

137
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:20,200
breaks even Right. We we know what's going on.

138
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:26,390
Our emotions have been taken out of the equation. We know what to expect Right.

139
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,410
We said look at this We go let's say we go on a 20-day hot streak.

140
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,940
Okay guys from 2011 to 2000 and almost 12 Okay,

141
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,770
we went on this like Tear we're almost every trade was a winner But we can see this

142
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,770
and we could say oh, you know what?

143
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,710
We are just probably somewhere on this graph right now But in the long run if I

144
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,550
keep doing this,

145
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,260
I'm not gonna really make any money I'm not gonna make any money.

146
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,960
So I'm not nervous. I'm not excited.

147
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:07,260
I know what to expect now What if this graph went up straight into the right?

148
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:14,210
okay straight into the right and You started trading this and You did ten trades

149
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,000
in a row that were profitable. How do you guys feel now?

150
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,370
How do you guys feel now?

151
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:27,310
Tell me how you feel So this we bet we back test it and this thing goes straight

152
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,290
up and you start trading it and it's up ten times in A row. How do you feel?

153
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,520
Well,

154
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,280
you feel good this time this time you actually feel good because you know that this

155
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:00,370
is gonna actually play out in the long Run you're actually going to make money Right

156
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,110
if this was down into the right and you went on ten times in a row you just be like,

157
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,950
ah, whatever I'm gonna lose. Anyways, I'm just catching a little run here,

158
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,440
right?

159
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,610
But it's because we know what to expect that we don't we're not emotional anymore

160
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,580
We're not excited about if this happens today.

161
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,840
It's what is supposed to happen Right when you get in your car and it starts going

162
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,740
forward You're not excited.

163
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,260
You're not sad This is what's supposed to happen if you get in your car you press

164
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,710
the gas and it go starts going backward You're gonna be like what the fuck?

165
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,330
Right,

166
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,210
or if you can't if you can't shoot three pointers and all of a sudden you shoot

167
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,570
through two three pointers in a row You're not gonna think I'm gonna be going to

168
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,730
the NBA, right?

169
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,970
You're gonna be like I got lucky and this is how we need to think about trading

170
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,950
and building strategies, right?

171
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,960
We need to be able to see what has actually happened,

172
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,900
you know and with option trading It's difficult because you don't it's hard to get

173
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,300
your hands on historical data Each situation is usually unique because there's expirations

174
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,580
Right, you can still do back testing for a lot of different strategies,

175
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:24,080
but usually they're very unique so like here's a way to think about it like This

176
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,780
might not be the best example.

177
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,290
I'm sitting here trying to think of an example to help Clarify what we mean by when

178
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,810
we say like there's no emotion attached to it We're not saying people like traders

179
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,590
don't feel happiness or feel sadness they're not robots they're people oh yeah,

180
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,790
this guy in the Zuck maybe are a robots by aliens,

181
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:49,900
but imagine this like imagine you ran a Landscaping company you mow lawns you mow

182
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,500
lawns for a living you own a company that does it and you make $200,000 a year doing

183
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,690
it but all your money is made between spring and Fall and when winter starts to

184
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,710
roll around you make zero you make zero dollars so for two-thirds of the year or

185
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,010
let's say for half the year you make $200,000 and then for the other half of the

186
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,490
year you make zero dollars and you know this you know This is gonna happen every

187
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,870
single year moving forward and today is June 1st,

188
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,030
and you're making money You've made a hundred thousand dollars in the last three

189
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,730
months and you're gonna make and you're like this is gonna want forever You for

190
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,850
six months you make you've made two hundred thousand dollars now,

191
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,730
you're not sitting there like yeah This is gonna go on forever because you know

192
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,960
That first little bit of snow falls No money's coming.

193
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,980
You're aware of that before it happens.

194
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,750
You've anticipated that you've calculated for that you spend accordingly So when

195
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,350
it does happen, you're not sitting there going. Where'd my cash flow go?

196
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,690
And when you're making money, you're not like yeah Yeah,

197
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,090
you're like this is my business.

198
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,930
My business is seasonal So you're not excited when you you know,

199
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,170
and then all winter you're you make no money and then You know spring rolls around

200
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,650
again, and somebody asks you to come up, you know,

201
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,570
mow the lawn for the first time You're not like oh my god.

202
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,290
I've broken the dry streak. You see what I'm saying?

203
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,930
You're aware of these things going into your business So you're not emotionally

204
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:23,120
attached to the fact that it's seasonal You might you might run multiple strategies,

205
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,860
right?

206
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,600
So you might run a summer strategy where you mow lawns and then a winter strategy

207
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,700
where you shovel driveways Exactly Marcos.

208
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,940
That's exactly we're thinking the same way, right? So and that's the thing.

209
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,460
Maybe you run multiple strategies, right?

210
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,920
So this strategy maybe runs counter even though it doesn't make money It runs counter

211
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,080
to the main strategy that the firm runs because it reduces their drawdowns Makes

212
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,560
their P&L more smooth reduces the volatility of the portfolio Right.

213
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,860
So does that make sense? Does that make sense why?

214
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,550
There's no when we say there's no emotion attached.

215
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,230
It's not that we don't enjoy money it's not that we don't enjoy making money is

216
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,550
that if you're aware that you make money now and you don't make money down the Road

217
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,540
and that it balances out to you making XYZ amount per year You're not sitting there

218
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,210
Freaking out when you're making or losing money you're only gonna start getting

219
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,010
a little nervous or excited or at least you know,

220
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,190
maybe neither but just Critical thinking about it when something outside of the

221
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,850
realm of what you're expecting happens,

222
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,890
you know Maybe it's December 30th and somebody's asking you to mow their lawn and

223
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,630
they pay in advance and you're like wait What why is everyone paid me to mow lawns

224
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,170
in winter has something changed? Yeah, you know what?

225
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,550
I mean global warming is like You know what? I mean?

226
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,060
That's a really good way to put it man, man Yeah,

227
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,340
so I was sitting there silent for about trying to think of something.

228
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,140
So take a look here All right, guys. Take a look.

229
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,100
This is a mean reverting strategy and you know what?

230
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,500
Imagined you are right here.

231
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,020
Take that in Imagine you just started trading the strategy.

232
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,330
You haven't back tested it properly with a computer and you're right here You're

233
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,500
on this huge upswing Huge upswing.

234
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,100
Could you imagine your P&L going forward? Could you imagine?

235
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,660
What would be happening?

236
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,610
You start making a lot of money You might buy some things you shouldn't be buying

237
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:40,050
Like a computer And then You are in a long-term losing game.

238
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,950
You're in a very long-term losing game, but in the short term, right?

239
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:50,470
You could be you could be on any one of these tears Any one of these rips and if

240
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,970
you don't fully understand your strategy,

241
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,740
you don't fully understand what's going on here You are gonna be really really tough

242
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,530
spot Okay,

243
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,650
this is what happens to all the traders all the all the traders they go on these

244
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,200
swings right here They have no clue what's been happening before Okay,

245
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,860
so how do we how do we fix this how do we fix this? well,

246
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,060
the the and maybe not how we fix this because you know it it's gonna require some

247
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,400
You know some other other tangible skills if you're doing the forecasting.

248
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,590
So remember we said there's two types There's a mispricing and then there's a forecasting.

249
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,790
So forecasting you'll usually see in People who are doing directional trades right

250
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,770
because we're trying to predict tomorrow's to the future price of the Stocks movement

251
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Right,

252
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,230
you'll see this in high-frequency trading to a high-frequency trader will do although

253
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,320
they will do these back tests all day long They'll try to find these variables which

254
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,530
we saw here, right?

255
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:59,070
They're gonna try to find a variable here that correlates With the assets return

256
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,020
and that's what they're gonna do all day long, right?

257
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,580
They're gonna work on their execution skills But at the end of the day,

258
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,660
they're trying to find something that's gonna help predict the future Now what we

259
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,560
actually see in financial markets,

260
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,780
okay the actual and this is what's gonna blow your mind Okay,

261
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,940
you guys are gonna book you guys you guys you guys are gonna be like buckle up buckle

262
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,630
up Actually, it's not gonna blow their mind too much. But okay.

263
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,690
I hope it gets you guys really thinking Okay of what we actually see in the world

264
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:38,390
so if I asked you guys What does your strategy look like? Okay,

265
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,590
if you let's say this was yours your signal this y-axis was your signal Sorry,

266
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,230
the x-axis was your signal.

267
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:53,140
So maybe it's your one three two step trading to finding breakouts okay,

268
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:00,230
and These were your signals right here and over here was the stock returns Okay.

269
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,110
So for example when your signal said buy let me draw. Can I draw on here Sean?

270
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,870
Okay,

271
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,550
so when your signal said buy so here's where it says buy and Here's where it says

272
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:24,460
sell which graph do you think would be the graph?

273
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,680
That would best describe your strategy Which graph do you think it would be and

274
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,150
why and let's say you had no emotions.

275
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,630
You were a robot Let's say you were a perfect robot who always executed always did

276
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,480
perfect risk management Which which which which one would you be on the graph?

277
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,750
Uh-huh.

278
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:59,980
Oh, you're hilarious man. Okay. Okay. Um Okay, maybe you guys can oh wait.

279
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,280
Oh see. Oh, oh, sorry. I thought okay. Sorry Cole.

280
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,060
I was looking at the wrong one I was looking at the wrong one call. Let's see.

281
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,980
Okay, that's it.

282
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,400
Yeah I was thought you were talking about F Cola aka if it was by you'd lose money

283
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,040
sell you this one. Okay, so Willis Marcos you guys are saying a Okay,

284
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:40,800
so Can you guys explain a little more why would it be a Why would it be a maybe

285
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:47,340
I should be a little more clear here. So so here is the stock returns.

286
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:58,180
So Here would be let's say like 10% and here would be negative 10% So when a you

287
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,200
guys are saying when your stock says buy when you're when your signal says buy you

288
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:13,430
lose 10% And when your signal says sell you're gonna You would lose 10% right because

289
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:20,840
the stock goes up Okay, so you guys are saying D Carson saying D.

290
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,480
So the reality is guys the reality is Okay,

291
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:40,840
the reality is your signal is actually gonna look like C This is actually what a

292
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,660
good strategy looks like is C I don't know you guys are saying like what the hell

293
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,770
this C means C looks like nothing C looks like absolutely nothing There is a correlation

294
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,090
of point zero eight, okay,

295
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:06,720
so what that means is this This our signal here briefly explains Has a very very

296
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:14,660
very very tiny bit of forecasting ability Very very small right exactly Marco.

297
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,890
It looks 5050, right? It looks 5050,

298
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:27,460
but it's not it's not it's super super super small and this is Actually a massive

299
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,780
edge in trading Okay,

300
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,940
a lot of traders are gonna shoot for something like this or something like this

301
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,180
or like even like this Right,

302
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,140
they're gonna try to get good signals like these or good signals like the ones All

303
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,620
the other ones right these are great. This is a great signal.

304
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,650
This is a perfect signal same with this one One to one one to one you signal says

305
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:56,900
this it does this This looks like there's no correlation. It's just noise.

306
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,200
Okay And in fact, it looks just like noise. Exactly.

307
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,160
It looks just like noise and the relationship just Very small,

308
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:16,000
I guess I did a little too small Right,

309
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,780
it doesn't even look like that's that's deep But this is actually what you guys

310
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,400
are gonna see in the market this right here.

311
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,660
This is your 90% hit rate your 90 93% hit rate your 85% hit rate your 70% hit rate

312
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:40,020
this over here This is your 52 53 percent hit rate and there's no way a human mind

313
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:47,720
a human human eyes can actually see this Right you you if you're really trained

314
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:47,940
at it,

315
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,320
you can see it But that's why it's so hard to actually think to actually know you

316
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,430
have an edge Right because you might win.

317
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:03,700
Let's say 55 out of 100 times and think you have an you know and think you have

318
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,840
an edge But an actual fact it's might just be 45 55 in the other in the opposite

319
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:15,400
direction or maybe even 50 50 So this is actually the reality of trading you guys

320
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,670
have any questions about this That you're that you're you're there's so much noise

321
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:27,840
There's so much noise in the markets and you're all you need is a super small signal

322
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,480
The signal has to be extremely the predictive power has to be extremely extremely

323
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,240
Small in order to make fortunes And I know that sounds crazy guys because everyone's

324
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,620
talking about a 60% hit rate a 70% hit rate an 80% hit rate it's actually the reality

325
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:55,840
a casino casino built a billion-dollar Empire off of 1% edge off a 2% edge off a

326
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,320
52% hit rate. Okay,

327
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:15,320
so keep that in mind By hit rate we mean like being correct Carson So

328
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,660
like if you were flipping a coin and you called heads you would have a fit if you

329
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,120
called heads 100% of the time You'd probably you'd have a 50% hit rate in the long

330
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,540
run And yeah Carson, why would you want a or B?

331
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:33,770
So just like in this graph right here Carson Let me just exit here.

332
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,450
So Carson just like in this graph over here And Carson, I know you're you know,

333
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,150
you're big into code.

334
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,610
You might want to check out the Quantstrat github This is where I pull the code

335
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:53,790
just to do the run run the back test there. It's done in R though Okay,

336
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,570
we're so remember remember in this right here,

337
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,770
oh do you know how to delete all the stuff here Sean This is a quick a quick like

338
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:09,280
a race all Annotate clear. Oh, okay. Perfect. Nice hide this. Yeah,

339
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,130
so just like in this graph, right? This is our signal.

340
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,950
This is our Our variable and in this case is the RSI Right,

341
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,890
so RSI tells you when something is cheap relative to the mean and expensive relative

342
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,290
to the mean So if you saw this Right,

343
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:33,620
even though it's negative you would say well every time RSI is below 30 buy shares

344
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:40,360
because it correlates with a 1% return the next day and Every time it's above let's

345
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,140
say 70 You'd want to sell shares because it goes below zero the return tomorrow

346
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:52,180
is below zero But what we see here is that this variable this trading signal whatever

347
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,680
it is You know, this is your one two, three step to trading, right?

348
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:02,040
This is your Buy when this and sell when this right whatever it is,

349
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,160
whatever your strategy is This is it and all this is telling us is well when it's

350
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,560
up here Things go down when it's below here things go up and it can explain the

351
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,560
returns tomorrow, right? This indicator explains the returns tomorrow.

352
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:24,120
Do you guys see how do you guys do you guys see that and this is This is what?

353
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,940
Professional trading in quantitative trading in the directional space.

354
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,460
This is what the best guys are doing Okay,

355
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,780
I just wanted you guys to get a feel for that to see what evidence-based trading

356
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,180
looks like Right, we're moving. We have computers now.

357
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,140
We're trying to move away from You know discretionary trading go do you want to

358
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,920
expand on what you're saying there and Just to touch on it quickly so Marcos has

359
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,240
asked a couple times during this just like or mentioned like it'd be kind of cool

360
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,620
to be able to do it for like multiple ideas or like What if instead of using the

361
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,820
the weekly you use the three-day or like, you know, like you use the 90-day?

362
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,300
Yeah,

363
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,240
right So I think so the thing about so the reason why people do this all day every

364
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,380
day Marcos is because there are unlimited combinations There are so many combinations

365
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:20,320
so many different things you can look at in so many different ways That you need

366
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
to do it all the time,

367
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,180
right if you're always looking for strategies you're doing this all the time We

368
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:33,440
actually tried to build out a backtesting model for the terminal but the thing is

369
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:42,060
that there's so many combinations that it's not feasible to To build to build it

370
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,700
out Hey Ram, you want to know one that?

371
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,560
Works out that we tested earnings Earnings does a great great job.

372
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,690
So does So does long overnight? Yeah long overnight,

373
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,070
that's what that's gonna be in the new terminal that's gonna be the new one back

374
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,330
So we have a couple of predictor variables where that explains the overnight return

375
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,370
right, and this is This is what's gonna be embedded in the terminal.

376
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:07,750
Eventually.

377
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:13,260
This is just a couple because like obviously we can't give you everything away There's

378
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,580
a couple good great strats for you guys to get involved and start doing it And I

379
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,760
know it's tough right? I know it's I know not everyone codes.

380
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,660
I everyone can do this There's actually backtesting softwares that can help you

381
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,970
with this Right,

382
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:32,260
but the point is you need evidence That's the whole point is that you need the evidence

383
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,950
You need to know does this actually work?

384
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,230
So so Ram I didn't know you actually followed us when we were running the overnight

385
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,210
Yeah,

386
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,110
so we were doing it live on the IG We stopped it after after 16 days because the

387
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,270
market literally fell out from beneath us and it's a long it's a long Long equity

388
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,150
trade so we were like this is this is not and that's actually when we started the

389
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,870
options Academy, right?

390
00:32:52,910 --> 00:33:00,880
That's when we made that change But take this in Ram Matt Maddy Matt Robinson in

391
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,240
our group.

392
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,680
He's been running the overnight the whole time So he's been on a huge tear huge

393
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,120
tear you can reach out to him to ask him about that if you want.

394
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,310
So Ram so our overnight strategy Okay,

395
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:23,290
so our overnight strategy does really well in the long run really really really

396
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:31,070
really well and But one thing about it is that it's tied it has correlation to the

397
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,950
market So imagine Ram imagine this was all the way up into the right this graph

398
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,400
right here What happened was we were we went we were on a run we were on like we

399
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
were during this period right here, right?

400
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,760
We were going up up up up up and then market got hit Or we started losing money

401
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
and Sean I realized hey, listen, you know what?

402
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,280
We can't have our business tied to the market, right?

403
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,140
We can't just be these guys that pump out one strategy and then You know,

404
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,560
so the originally we were actually teaching guys how to do this kind of stuff and

405
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,640
giving them the tools And to trade these these strategies, right?

406
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,480
We had we had a short strategy for example That was short Boeing before the crash

407
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,140
and actually held through the crash and you'll you'll did it you'll held through

408
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,780
right Neil did really well there We also you you know, this might you know,

409
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,380
I swear to God you guys can reach out to to Damien Instagram he's actually in the

410
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,780
discord. He's in the discord.

411
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:36,630
He we had a we had a value strat That's a value momentum shot that said by Kodak

412
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,950
in May and like, you know,

413
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:44,530
you're supposed to know it was in April Yeah And it was these are like, well,

414
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,850
you know Strategies are supposed to hold for quite a long period of time.

415
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:55,030
So we have these strategies built in But we don't we don't want to be a signal service

416
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,090
and we don't want people to be tied to our strategies Right.

417
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,010
So that's why we decide to move over to the the option space and teach right and

418
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,350
actually like educate on how to build Your own tools how to build your own systems,

419
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,070
etc Yeah,

420
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,630
so Kodak wasn't in the terminal because it was too small back in the day in micro

421
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,670
cap Yeah,

422
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,290
we don't we don't have that in there because you shouldn't be trading options on

423
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,690
those Yeah, and actually I don't think they had options until Release.

424
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,710
Yeah Till I went to the moon. Yeah, and then back down to earth really quick.

425
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:30,360
So cool has a couple good questions here Up a bit. Okay. So Koa said like hey,

426
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,120
you know what? I actually only so he uses a back testing machine a fantastic.

427
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,600
Oh, I'm very happy to hear this man.

428
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,990
So he actually uses a Back testing machine trade machine trade machine and he said

429
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:48,110
like I like to look for high probability strategies The problem is if you just so,

430
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,830
you know We all think in terms of expected value and this yeah,

431
00:35:52,870 --> 00:36:00,840
and this can't be So one thing is if you test everything a couple things are gonna

432
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,370
hit Right, like you see so,

433
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:07,010
you know how I did on Apple and the P&L looked way different I bet you if I did

434
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,790
this exact same strategy on a stock. I don't know. Give me let's do. Okay,

435
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,550
let's do Okay,

436
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:21,420
once give me a stock here any stock quick quick quick quick Baba actually,

437
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
okay Baba trend so ramen this won't work on there.

438
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:34,990
I need something like here's a good one actually So this is natural gas So you guys

439
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,510
see how the computer is running super quick doing all this this would take years

440
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,660
for a human to do This is gonna take years for the computer to do. Yeah,

441
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,380
so We're still in 2014.

442
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,400
Yeah You know by testing this strategy on thousands of thousands of equities We're

443
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,400
gonna find one that it actually does well on and this is actually,

444
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:05,720
you know Let's see how this did okay it into to all Yeah,

445
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:12,210
it definitely into to all did terrible actually I'm like wait a minute But if this

446
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,010
if the stock just chopped up and down like this,

447
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:20,250
it would it would done really well The point is it's we can't be doing this with

448
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:25,560
like thousands of stocks and not understanding why we're doing it We need to have

449
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,810
the reason I'm back testing this strategy because of this and this and this Yeah,

450
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:38,130
so you remember this Patterns exist in randomness and in order,

451
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:45,430
okay They you will find patterns in the clouds You'll find patterns in human behavior.

452
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,410
You'll find patterns in data Some will make sense.

453
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,040
Some don't make sense a prime example.

454
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,440
You can go watch it Jim Simons talks about it The founder of Renaissance Technologies

455
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,720
probably one of the group Probably the greatest trader of all time big big fund

456
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,300
manager trader of all time 70% year-over-year averages with a 10-figure account

457
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,470
how the fuck he does it.

458
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,620
No one knows except for him and his team But the point is that he gave an interview

459
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:20,240
where he said we actually found a one-to-one perfect correlation for the S&P 500

460
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,750
returns we were looking at the S&P return and predictor variable was Corn cycles

461
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:35,620
in Italy something about something wild corn production in northern Italy and You

462
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:41,240
can sit there and go Wow one-to-one Phenomenal, but should you trade it?

463
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,270
Does it make sense that how much corn was grown in a region in Italy?

464
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,440
Predicts how the biggest market in the world returns.

465
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,720
Does it make sense? Like should we trade even though it's perfect?

466
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,400
We look back to back test is like you would make you'd be the richest person in

467
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,580
the world if you did this Does it make sense? And then, you know,

468
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,980
there's things like overfitting for example, right?

469
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,550
So there's lots of different Yeah, exactly.

470
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,170
Like should if mercury's in retrograde should should we be?

471
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:21,960
selling futures Right You know what I mean?

472
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,110
So with when you're creating a strategy guys,

473
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,290
especially in the directional space, okay,

474
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,730
especially in the directional space When you're creating a strategy you first have

475
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:36,780
to answer the question Why should this work? What are you looking for? Right?

476
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:46,460
example in the overnight returns we said What one of these signals is is the VIX

477
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,560
in contango. That's one of the signals that actually works okay,

478
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,900
and Our theory is well when implied volatility is high involved volatility is high

479
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,910
We are less likely to see high overnight returns Because stocks when stocks are

480
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,190
volatile, they're usually going down Okay,

481
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,230
if the markets expecting so VIX is the future looking forward looking So if the

482
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,050
markets expecting volatility in the future and we know the market's smart Then we

483
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,050
shouldn't be long overnight.

484
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:25,700
And so that was our theory then we tested it and guess what it worked That's how

485
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,960
you have to build these systems.

486
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,840
That's how you have to build these strategies Even if you're doing it discretionary,

487
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,320
even if you're saying I'm gonna buy when there's a new 52-week high I'm gonna buy

488
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,220
when there's when we're looking at an intraday breakout.

489
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,450
We have to ask the question. Why should this work?

490
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,890
Okay, and it can't be human behaviors.

491
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,250
I don't know if some of you guys were in live yesterday We can't say oh because

492
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,410
of human pattern human patterns. It's gonna work. Okay,

493
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,290
there's no intraday human patterns, right?

494
00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:00,610
90% are algorithms 90% of the volume is algorithms. There's no emotions there.

495
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,800
So we need to ask yourself. Why would this work?

496
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,370
Once we do that we try to test it as best we can we either use a software or I mean

497
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,430
I really don't want to say this. Actually. I'm not gonna say it.

498
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,590
I was gonna say You do it manually. I'll just say you don't do it.

499
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,730
You don't do it like that That's how you build these strategies or you go on Fiverr

500
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,060
and say hey, buddy. Listen, can you back test a strategy for me?

501
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,860
He'll charge you 20 bucks. You back testing a strategy.

502
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,070
He lets you know how it worked We used to do that we used to do that we were 50

503
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,610
bucks now, we're a hundred bucks Oh, you want your strategy back testing? Okay,

504
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,130
but not for the group though for the group.

505
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:49,970
We give you guys 90 bucks Okay Right. So Ram.

506
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:55,140
Why don't why don't you break down a strategy you're thinking of and we'll talk

507
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,900
about it We're gonna talk about it right now on the live Ram right here.

508
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,950
Tell me about it What were you thinking up because I know there's other guys in

509
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,450
this group Yeah, I know those other guys in this group You know,

510
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,730
I know Marcos for example,

511
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:13,870
he's very he's he's he's active He's very active and he has a signal he has a strategy

512
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:17,710
He has a signal but what we need to do as a trader say well to get that confidence

513
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,930
A lot of people are looking for confidence here all the time We're looking for confidence

514
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,070
to get that confidence.

515
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:33,430
We need to know if it actually works Ram do you mind explaining your strategy a

516
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,630
little bit?

517
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:39,190
I don't this is it I've seen something like buying aftermarket spy and then selling

518
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,230
it at the open the next day. Is that the one?

519
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,180
Okay, perfect. Well Ram. It says you raised your hand.

520
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,100
Did you want to come in the life?

521
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:06,820
Okay, perfect. Let me Okay Sean's the the zoom technician.

522
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:17,890
Let me see if I can do this Ram Okay, I think I think we got it. Hey,

523
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:25,550
buddy Hey, hey, man. Hey, hey Jordan yet so for for the stocks, okay Yeah,

524
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:36,030
no worries For stocks when the 5 EMA crosses above the 10 and the 21 EMA Okay Shit,

525
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,930
what else is that? I had it written down. Yeah,

526
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:45,650
maybe that one For short term right when the 5 EMA crosses above the the 10 EMA

527
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,930
and the 21 EMA Okay,

528
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,450
so super easy to back test and I'll actually do that for the group.

529
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,070
I think Marcos wanted that as well I'm not gonna do it on the life here,

530
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,610
but I'll do it for the group. Cool So let's actually talk about this though.

531
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,860
Why do you think this should work? What? What made you think of this idea?

532
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:06,820
Yeah.

533
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,880
Well this one I got actually early on when I when I started trading I read this

534
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,050
guy's books very concise to the point books Steven Joseph Burns,

535
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,970
I think I follow him on Instagram, but I was like, you know, what? Why not?

536
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,030
let me let me give this a shot and Based on what he was doing and then I applied

537
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:35,270
it and I really didn't even tweak it I just used it and it worked for for for trading

538
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,050
trading wise,

539
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,710
right and it works pretty well And then sometimes I even expand it out like on a

540
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,270
weekly Weekly chart or like a monthly right if I'm trying to go long something kind

541
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,590
of kind of swinging something or if I want to Hold something as long as that holds

542
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,350
Like even if though if the five crosses above the ten and the twenty one then,

543
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,250
you know Let's say the twenty one crosses above the fifty days simple moving average

544
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:57,710
Well,

545
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:04,280
like the fifty crosses above you get a golden cross or some shit like that It'll

546
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,730
work like we're for like a swing trade and I seen it like Although I was making

547
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,560
money off of it. And so I got a cool. Are you still using it today? Yeah,

548
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,780
just for like for swinging stocks Like in and out kind of thing yeah,

549
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:26,360
the five when the five crosses above the The ten and the twenty one I'll use it

550
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,530
Gotcha,

551
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,410
and so if I like tested it on Apple like you would think it should have a positive

552
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,540
Expectancy perhaps. Yeah,

553
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,840
I'm interested in seeing because I like I don't know anything about coding like

554
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:45,200
I see you get voting It's like is this long and short or just long Short as well

555
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,180
short as well.

556
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,360
So when the five crosses below the ten and the twenty one and Then even through

557
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,860
the the the fifty,

558
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:00,420
you know sometimes I sometimes I get an early which kind of messes me up sometimes

559
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,440
but When when the five crosses below the ten and the twenty one like, you know,

560
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:09,260
it's on a downtrend maybe for the short term But I'm interested in seeing what that

561
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,340
actually yields Over the long term. Yeah, definitely.

562
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,700
I like that's I can definitely do that for sure Ram,

563
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,880
but my question is like why do you think this might actually work? Like,

564
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,700
you know how like for example, we sell options around earnings and we say well,

565
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,800
it's overpriced because of you know People don't really know how to price these

566
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,300
assets. They're they're buying options to take directional bets.

567
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,640
There's no real up.

568
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,500
There's no real Natural sellers right hedge funds are using it to buy protection.

569
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,780
So we usually think all should be overpriced In this case,

570
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,120
what do you think is causing that return?

571
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,160
I'm not too sure To be honest with you.

572
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,600
I'm not I'm not too sure maybe maybe it's just the price action the way that the

573
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,480
stock is moving like I don't know like I'm not I'm not too sure Um,

574
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,520
so like this, you know, it might be working for you right now,

575
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:13,370
but this is something that we can kind of like Get in trouble with right because

576
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,330
like Sean always says like, you know, you start you start to say like,

577
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,950
okay This actually works and then when it stops working,

578
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,090
you don't know why and you can't trading it and you keep trading it.

579
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,020
Mm-hmm We always want to find out why would this work?

580
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,040
Okay. Okay. Yeah, does that make sense? Yeah,

581
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,830
I understand and that's where you're really gonna find the edge because you're gonna

582
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,750
totally understand your strategy yeah,

583
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,070
and we got to remember right like and I'm like,

584
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,510
this is not an attack on you in any way.

585
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,750
Like it's just like to get you to think about it You know, yeah. Yeah, right.

586
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,770
Yeah, dude. This is awesome. You came on man. Love it.

587
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:52,590
Remember like You're your own portfolio manager Right.

588
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:56,890
So imagine imagine you weren't your own portfolio manager Imagine you were investing

589
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,450
in you and you went to talk to you and you said can you explain this to me?

590
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,450
Right and there you explain the strategy go cool and they're like,

591
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,130
but why should this work and you're like,

592
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,560
I don't really know But it does You know what? I mean?

593
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,380
Like you like why the fuck am I giving this guy my money, right?

594
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,380
See that we got to think about it like that,

595
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,050
right if we remove ourselves from the situation We go like would I give someone

596
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,160
my money who's running this strategy? No,

597
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,320
no Yourself your money right and like that's why we got we got to think critically

598
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,440
right like um and look if it's worked so far and like look there's you know,

599
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,920
it's It sounds like there's some thought that's gone into it All that needs to be

600
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,320
done now is we need that we need to look at this idea test it and we need to understand

601
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,120
Why this might work? Right,

602
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,240
right You know like for example the overnight strategy the overnight strategy basically

603
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,060
filters out assets that we should be buying at the closed selling at the open because

604
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:58,950
they have a like a liquidity risk premium Right.

605
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:02,590
So because it's the markets are closed The market could tank overnight and you can't

606
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:06,470
get out and you're holding the bag if it opens So there's a premium for holding

607
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:10,960
these assets overnight And what we see is that these premiums that you're getting

608
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,260
paid outweigh the losses of when some shit does go down That's why this makes money

609
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,680
because someone else is not willing to carry that risk.

610
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,320
We are willing to carry that risk We get paid a premium for carrying the risk that

611
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:29,300
someone else doesn't want what what happens just a question here What happens like,

612
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,280
you know When when Tesla stock is gonna split or Apple stock is gonna split at the

613
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,460
end of August for for Apple What happens to those options?

614
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,760
Let's say you were holding Longer data does they'll adjust they adjust like perfectly

615
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,520
they there's there's no arm there or anything like that.

616
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:54,390
They'll adjust immediately Does that strategy take a long time to to to test or

617
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,150
it just kind of look like the 5 10 20 thing? Yeah,

618
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:03,090
it would take me it would take me 20 minutes. Okay. Yeah,

619
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:07,770
if you want to write it down on paper so I can just Frequent it that'd be great.

620
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:16,270
Yeah And so also so right right off the back so I got tested so many strategies

621
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:25,720
In the past Ram what we see is like so that's a trend-following strategy Yeah,

622
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:31,760
if we do it on a stock like Apple Tesla Amazon those are right because they trend

623
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,160
for a long time. Yeah. Yeah Maybe not they trend for a long time.

624
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,160
They have been trending.

625
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,180
There's a difference Yeah That's what I was reading in the book as well Like,

626
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,280
you know Like the trend is your friend and this this one helps you with the trend

627
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,660
right or whenever it's down Like when you when you see a reverse from like a bullish

628
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,920
trend to a bearish trend you can use it the other way As well, so yeah, right.

629
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,220
That'll be really interesting to see the results,

630
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,320
but if we did it on a stock like IBM, right?

631
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,180
We probably wouldn't make any money Mm-hmm,

632
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:05,820
because IBM is mean reverting right once once we get the crossover. Yeah,

633
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,560
it's not gonna trend anymore It's gonna come back down right if we take a look at

634
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:14,970
the chart for IBM So, okay, so you see here for example,

635
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,350
let me pull it up here Okay, Ram, you see the RSI strategy here on Apple. Yep.

636
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:26,020
It does so bad Right does terrible right and the reason it does terrible is because

637
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:31,860
Apple has just been trending for the last 20 years But if we look at a stock like

638
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:37,860
IBM Where there was no trend. Mm-hmm.

639
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:43,080
All of a sudden this mean reverting strategy Does a little bit better than break

640
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,430
-even Right.

641
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,430
So what the core thing is what you would want to do in this situation is like what

642
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,900
is it that out? Why is it that Apple trends? Right,

643
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,420
what causes Apple to trend what causes Amazon to trend?

644
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,900
It's not the EMA 5 over the EMA 20 that causes Apple to trend.

645
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,440
It's something else about it And that's that's the real signal Right.

646
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,280
So you so you have like two different types of when you're building out these strategies

647
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,430
You have two different things you have a signal and a filter So a filter tells you

648
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:22,670
these are the stocks you should trade The signal tells you when to trade them.

649
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,280
Does that make sense?

650
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,340
Yes,

651
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:33,060
so just to just to clear just to make sure it's 100% clear Let's say your strategy

652
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,650
is you want to buy value stocks? Okay,

653
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,200
you want to be let's say the guy that picks the bottom and the stocks rally Well,

654
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,630
the filter would be like find stocks that have a low price to earnings the signal

655
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:55,240
would be Buy the stock when the RSI goes below 70. Oh, sorry goes below 30,

656
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:06,300
right? So you're having that filter plus the signal gives you the trade Cool.

657
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,050
Yep. I understand Ram if you could please send me that list man.

658
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,370
I honestly dude I appreciate you coming out here and chatting man.

659
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,350
Anytime you want to come on. Just let me know Of course. Yeah,

660
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,510
I'll send you a message. Yeah,

661
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:23,530
please do or even post in the group post in the group I'll get on that look like

662
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:28,030
right here. No, no, no, like posting like the the traders chat or something.

663
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:43,440
Gotcha Okay, Ram. We're gonna let you go if you pulled that Okay Hey,

664
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:51,080
can you repeat the last statement Jordan? Can you repeat the last statement?

665
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,060
Don't remember it. Oh cool. Was it the one where I said?

666
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:03,120
Put it in the traders chat Okay, so there's a filter and there's a signal Okay,

667
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:08,320
there's a filter and there's a signal the filter tells you what you should be looking

668
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,800
at, right? There's 7,000 stocks out there.

669
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,970
The filter tells you what I should be looking at the signal tells you when to make

670
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:23,010
that trade Okay, if there's a value stock that's super cheap,

671
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,970
but the signal says it's not there yet It still has a little bit more room to go

672
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:34,500
That's the signal so you find so here's a great example. Okay,

673
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:39,260
you figure out what's in common with all trending stocks Those are your groups of

674
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:45,550
stocks to look at The signal is well is the EMA 5 over the EMA 10 and is the EMA

675
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:50,140
10 over the EMA 21 If it's not you don't take that trade.

676
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,520
These are hypothetical by the way. Yeah,

677
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,030
I'm not telling someone to do that Right, right. No, no,

678
00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:01,230
like you wouldn't for example if the EMA 5 and the EMA 10 are over the EMA 21 on

679
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,390
IBM You wouldn't take the trade.

680
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:10,420
Why because IBM doesn't trade doesn't trend But you might do it on BYND or you might

681
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,310
do it on Tesla, right? So it's filter signal.

682
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:32,360
Okay Awesome awesome so Marcos has one last thing here

683
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,000
I saw a post some time ago a woman trader backtested that strategy and beat the

684
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,700
actual spy by 10 to 20 percent if That's the case. That's great. But Here,

685
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:50,020
I'll repeat this if you don't know why this isn't working You will get screwed.

686
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:50,240
Yeah,

687
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,240
you can't put your money behind it You can't it's gonna it's gonna bite you in the

688
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,270
ass because that that is gonna bring that I don't have any confidence I don't have

689
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:03,160
any confidence about this trade right Another way to think about it.

690
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,340
I'm just gonna say there. No,

691
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:11,360
okay So there's a guy and actually I actually talked to him Online before many times.

692
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:17,000
His name is Rob Carver. Okay, so he used to work at a QR Sorry,

693
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,160
he used to work at man capital,

694
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,320
which is one of the biggest like biggest quant firms ever He did really well and

695
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,640
he did like I was it like I think 35% 40% on his capital and this we're talking

696
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,990
millions of dollars for Quite a long period of time. Okay,

697
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:40,750
it was fantastic Great great great trader the signal, right?

698
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:47,130
So let's say it's the we're gonna keep it super simple simple The SMA 200 that signal

699
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,570
has to pick up on trends. So what does that mean?

700
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:56,120
The way they do it is they'll create simulated data. Okay,

701
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:02,090
this is how this how real traders do it They'll create a simulated data So they're

702
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:02,950
gonna do random data,

703
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,630
but they're gonna put a trend factor in there They're gonna say,

704
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:15,060
you know random data but at a trend Very small trend at it and then they're gonna

705
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:21,270
create the strategy and see if it can pick up on it Can it pick up on the simulated

706
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:26,480
data? Can the 200 day moving average pick up on this trend?

707
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,320
How well does it pick up on this trend?

708
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,840
And if it picks up really well, that's gonna be their signal now.

709
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,360
All they need is the filter What should I put in this signal? Okay,

710
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,980
and that's how these like in-depth Delta one Delta one mean directional strategies

711
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:54,280
are actually built created and used in in the professional space Okay,

712
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,120
and you can read his book his book is called Systematic trading Rob Carver all about

713
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,520
trend following and how he uses the filters with the signals to build a strategy

714
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,140
Okay, guys, I think that is going to do it for today's live. Yeah.

715
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,900
I hope you guys are pumped Yeah,
