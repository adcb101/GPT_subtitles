1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,670
So a lot of the times when we're looking at trades,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,770
we encourage you to look at very liquid names, right?

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,340
It removes a lot of the nuance that's needed. It makes it easy to get started,

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,430
right?

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,650
But there's opportunity any liquid names and tonight's topic is gonna help you as

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,050
you look to trade these illiquid names, right?

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,690
Which is something especially for our more advanced members.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,270
It's worth exploring, right? Illiquid names are worth exploring.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,250
So tonight's topic is how to identify and understand the vol line that you enter

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,670
a trade at, okay?

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,390
So instead of looking at just the dollars that you entered a trade on,

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,650
understanding and thinking in terms of the volatility that you entered your trade

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:43,910
at.

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,960
Okay, let's do it. Let's make it happen.

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,100
And we're gonna power through this guys. Let me just quickly see who's on,

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,410
who we,

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,980
sorry, one second guys, let me just,

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,020
hey Sean. Yeah, what's up? If I want to, so I can see the chat here.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,790
I can't see the participants. Okay, can you see it? Oh, here we go. Got it,

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,350
got it. Yeah, I don't know.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,820
Okay, perfect, perfect. Jared, nice to see you out here.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,280
I see everyone out here. Margin, great to see you guys.

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,500
I think you guys are gonna find this extremely useful. Steven B as well,

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,280
just cause I know you've been getting into some of the liquid names. Okay,

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
so we're gonna look at ARCX.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,400
ARCX, Steve B brought this one to my attention. So we're gonna chat about it.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,420
And this is actually one of the gold questions as well. Or the silver test,

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,370
sorry, I should say. Okay, everyone.

29
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,060
So everyone can see my screen?

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,220
Yeah, I assume so. Okay, so let's take a look at ARCX here guys.

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,460
Let's look at these puts, 21 strike puts November. Bid is 50 cents, ask is $5.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,760
You come in here, you put an order.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,440
Let's say you want to buy these options and you go, you know,

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,860
you hit the mid for 275 and you get filled for 275 instantly, let's say.

35
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,900
And you think, hey, that's, you know, I got filled at mid.

36
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,920
The issue here is mid is not fair value. Okay,

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,800
mid is not even the market's fair value. Mid is just,

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,580
it's just the number between the bid and the ask. Okay,

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,080
if the person on the ask is more aggressive,

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,300
the mid is gonna be a lot favorable to the buyer than to the seller. Okay,

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,380
so the mid is not fair value. It's not the market's fair value.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,140
It's just a number. And so as a trader, when we look at something liquid, okay,

43
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,120
when we look at something liquid.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,280
Do you want me to slow down there and maybe like make it really,

45
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,080
really clear why it wouldn't be fair value? Yeah. I can do that.

46
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,690
Sure, I was gonna draw it up right here. Yeah,

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,970
I'll do it cause I can probably do it quicker.

48
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,580
Okay, so imagine we're looking at a stock. We have the bid and the ask, right?

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,900
We have someone sitting here at $5 or let's say, you know,

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,900
someone sitting here at $1 and $10. The mid is gonna be like $5. Okay,

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,480
so this would be the bid, the ask and the mid. Okay,

52
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,450
and let's say there's one lot sitting here and one lot sitting here.

53
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,360
Now let's say all of a sudden, somebody comes in here and puts an ask at $7.

54
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,170
The mid's instantly gonna jump down here, right?

55
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,460
Somewhere like maybe three bucks, right? 3.5.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,980
So if the mid can change so easily,

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,640
all that happened is somebody came in here and dropped an ask lower than what there

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,160
is. How the heck can we think of this as fair value for the asset, right?

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,980
It's very, very malleable. Changes very, very easily.

60
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,880
And it's not really a reflection of what this thing's actually worth.

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,220
Is Jordan anything to add there? Nope, that's it. Okay, great.

62
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,760
I'll make you host again. Nice, that was quick, nice and quick.

63
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,100
Okay, so you guys saw what Sean was saying there, right? Mid is nothing.

64
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,410
So let's take a look. When we have something liquid, let's say the NASDAQ,

65
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,090
the Q's, mid is gonna be great. You got really competitive markets,

66
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,890
really smart people on both sides of the market, okay?

67
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,530
Mid is gonna be fantastic. That's a liquid market. But an illiquid market,

68
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,940
mark X, okay? Mid is meaningless.

69
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,190
So we come in here and let's say we think vol's expensive, okay?

70
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,460
Our brokerage tells us it's 40 implied vol. This number,

71
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,500
we don't even know if it's legit. There's no spread.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,260
We can't just look at this number, right?

73
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,380
If we're looking at interactive brokers, we can't just look at the number,

74
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,340
especially on something illiquid.

75
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,820
So we need to come in here and we need to price this thing. Well,

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,580
let's take a look, guys.

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,260
Let's say I wanna buy this asset. I wanna buy it at 40 vol.

78
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,620
What number does that actually need to be? So let's come over to terminal,

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,640
okay? We're gonna come right over here. And ARKX is trading at $21.05.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So right now, guys, we're on option calculator, okay?

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,740
We're gonna show you two calculators today to get you guys on the way, okay?

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,260
ARKX trading at 21.05. Strike, we're looking at the 21.

83
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,840
Let's just double check. We're trying to price this option right here.

84
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,260
Expiration, type in expiration. November 21.

85
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,820
All right, Jordan, maybe slow it down for a second.

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,310
What exactly are you trying to do here? I'm pricing the option.

87
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,210
So I'm pricing the option using the Black-Scholes formula,

88
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,110
using how everyone looks at volatility.

89
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,130
And the reason you're doing this is because you can't rely on the market to give

90
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,250
you the right price. You need to actually figure it out yourself.

91
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,150
And the reason is because, basically, there's not enough people trading it.

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,200
Correct. It's like, you know how with supply and demand,

93
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,580
they meet somewhere and that's like the equilibrium. It's like, well,

94
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,720
what if there's only one demand and one supply? It's like,

95
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,000
how can you count on that being any sort of representation of fair value?

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,090
You can't, so you gotta go calculate it. Correct. Lucky enough,

97
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,280
we have that built into the terminal here. Yeah. So we choose expiration,

98
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,820
November 19, and we put in the volatility that we wanna buy it at.

99
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,360
Let's say we wanna buy it at 42 vol, okay? Or sorry,

100
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,510
we wanna sell it at 42 vol. And, you know, interest rates are zero, dividend,

101
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,190
we'll say are zero, okay? And when we run that,

102
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,540
we get the price of this call option at $2.77, okay?

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:20,960
So if we wanna sell this at 42 vol, we need to sell it at $2.77. Now, you know,

104
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,400
as we go below that, let's say we end up selling this thing.

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,880
Let's say we didn't know how to price these options and we finally got filled at

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:35,020
$2, okay? Well, we have something else. We have the volatility calculator,

107
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,660
okay? And what this is gonna do is, you're gonna put in the call option,

108
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:47,610
put option, whatever it is, okay? The underlying price, so 21.05, strike 21,

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,740
okay? November, and the market price. We just sold this option for $2.

110
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,220
We sold at a 30 implied vol,

111
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,650
okay? We sold at 30 implied vol, but we wanted, 278 was it?

112
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,130
We wanted that 42 vol line,

113
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,320
okay? So when you're trading in the illiquid market,

114
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,500
you need to price your options, right? If you were doing, let's say a straddle,

115
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,320
well, you would price the call and you would price the put,

116
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,800
all right? But this is crucial. This is crucial.

117
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,900
For the guys who are trading in illiquid stuff,

118
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,300
just specifically on this live for sure, Margin, Steve B, Jared,

119
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,480
I know you're getting into that space.

120
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,080
You need to be able to price the option or you're gonna get screwed getting in that

121
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,460
mid. And for those of you that aren't necessarily looking at it,

122
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,080
here's an example of where you'd use it, right?

123
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,340
Let's say you're on the volatility analyzer page and you see that, you know,

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,250
as a stock is trading at, you know, you look at the vol cone,

125
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,810
it's trading at the maximum vol, you think it's expensive and that's 100 vol,

126
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,610
all right? And you look at like the third quantile and you say,

127
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,170
that's where I think it'll drop to. And that's 75 vol.

128
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,110
But then you go to the option chain itself and it's illiquid, right?

129
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,890
You're seeing all sorts of random numbers there, right? You may be like,

130
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,930
what would you maybe see there, Jordan, if it was a liquid?

131
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,280
You might see for like on the option chain. Yeah.

132
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,420
You might see like some weird ass implied vols. Right?

133
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,910
Let me see if I can find one here for you guys.

134
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,030
I think it's a little bit more liquid now,

135
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:43,080
but what's an illiquid volatile name?

136
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,840
An illiquid, try like AMC.

137
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,400
Here, you know what? Actually, I think I remember one.

138
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,040
The furthest side of the money is like trading at like 1,100 implied vol.

139
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,780
AMC? Yeah, if you scroll all the way up. All right, you can see them there.

140
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,720
So it's okay if it's, okay. Aha, here we go, perfect. Yeah. Okay,

141
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,960
so look at this, guys, right here. This put is trading at 1,400 implied vol,

142
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,320
but the ask is, or the call is trading for 529 vol. Arbitrage, right?

143
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,040
But there isn't. This is just,

144
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,690
you can see the spread is 45 cents here and the spread here is a penny. Okay,

145
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,870
so that's why, you know, you're gonna get these weird vols.

146
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,610
But I think for different brokerages, as Jared was mentioning, is different.

147
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:50,850
For thinkorswim, the implied vol is at the mid, which is unrealistic. Okay?

148
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,090
Right, so what you'd wanna be doing is, you know, like let's say, you know,

149
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,010
you look at that stock, it has 100 implied vol on the, you know,

150
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,280
on your vol cone. You're like, I wanna be selling 100 vol.

151
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,060
But then you go to the option chain for that option and the spread is so wide that

152
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,790
the mid is not that. Well,

153
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,360
what price do you need to get filled at to actually sell 100 vol? You know,

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,320
a lot of us, when we're new, we would think we can just go in and sell it.

155
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,360
Just try to get a good fill.

156
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,510
But that fill you get needs to actually be what you want. Right? You know,

157
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,390
and if you're getting filled less than that, you need to be aware of it. Right,

158
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,110
so maybe you price it out with 100 vol using the option calculator,

159
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,510
and you see that you need to be selling the combined straddle for $10. Right,

160
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,780
and the mid might be $6. You know, who knows? You get what I'm saying. Well,

161
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,520
you know now that if you go below $10,

162
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,240
you're not actually selling what you think you are and you need to adjust.

163
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,600
You know, if we had- You can use it. Exactly. We had a guy in our group,

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,420
plays a lot of roulette, you guys might know him. And he slapped the ask today,

165
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,300
from what I hear, on a name where, you know,

166
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,780
the implied vol was so different at different strikes.

167
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,120
So here's an example of GSX, okay?

168
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,890
Let's say I wanted to sell this vol and I slapped the ask or slapped the bid.

169
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,970
Well, I'm gonna be getting filled, or I'm sorry, I slapped the mid.

170
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,810
I'm gonna be getting filled at 96 vol, right? Where the mid here is 105 vol,

171
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,490
107 vol. So you really need to be able to price these out,

172
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,830
especially in these liquid names.

173
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,540
Yeah, Technoking, you got me. It was me, it was me.

174
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,180
It was Sean, it was Sean, exactly.

175
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,660
Yeah, so any questions about this, guys? Right, it's not a super long live.

176
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,340
You know, what I would like to see is, you know,

177
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,980
I would like to see people using this.

178
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,300
You'll get a lot better by pricing it out.

179
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,740
Roubet Junkie is asking how do I- Roubet Junkie, how do you make money from it?

180
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Every dollar saved is a dollar earned.

181
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,900
So if you spend a dollar from not knowing this, well, you just, you know,

182
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,840
you could have saved a dollar. AKA, you made money.

183
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,900
AKA, another round of Roubet.

184
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,030
All right. Any more questions? I think it's a pretty straightforward one.

185
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,510
There might be a little bit of like a gap still for some people, which is okay.

186
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,650
Go practice. If you wanna show us, you know, post it in the group,

187
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:09,060
go try and do it. We can all take a look. And now's your chance to speak up,

188
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,330
guys. We can go through an example right now. Now's your chance.

189
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,040
Going once, twice.

190
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,300
How flexible are you about the IV you want to sell? Honestly,

191
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,660
it depends on how much edge is there, right?

192
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,640
That's the important thing of valuing. So Harry,

193
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,400
here's something in not vol terms that we can all understand.

194
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,400
We think Apple's worth a hundred dollars. How much would you pay for Apple?

195
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,520
Anything below a hundred, right? Or with some room for error, okay? So,

196
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,940
you know, maybe whatever that number is.

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,700
But the key point is you had to value it.

198
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,840
You had to say Apple was worth a hundred dollars.

199
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,520
And the same thing goes for vol trading. We said,

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,340
when I ran that regression for GSX, the fair value of GSX vol was 105 vol.

201
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:12,420
It was 105 vols for value. We hit 107 today, 108, and we got out, right?

202
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:13,980
Perfect.

203
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,240
Yeah, so Kyle's saying, you ever forget to put the div yield in?

204
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,460
The div yield is actually pretty important. Right, Marjan?

205
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,980
Let's take a look here just super quick. Price calculator, volatility,

206
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,350
let's say 30, interest rate in yield. Okay, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:45,620
In dividend yield is in yield. So let's say 3%. It might have to be 0.03.

208
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,120
Let me just see what I did here. Yeah, okay, it's 0.03. That's 300%.

209
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,370
Okay, so that actually drops the option by a dollar. Okay,

210
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,010
but then don't forget, there's gonna be like three or four,

211
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,840
two dividends in between this. So, you know,

212
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,880
sometimes you do forget it's not usually that important, right?

213
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,880
Cause the put's gonna go up as well. And I usually, I'm doing straddles.

214
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm not doing an individual leg, but if you're doing an individual leg margin,

215
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,780
it's important to understand that, okay?

216
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,520
This is annually. Yes, Harry, annually dividend yield.

217
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,370
Okay, any more questions?

218
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,410
Yeah, I did it on last week before I did it on Wednesday,

219
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,210
Wednesday of last week or Thursday of last week.

220
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,070
You just gotta be lurking around late on a Friday night or something.

221
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,130
Jordan's got a couple of drinks in him. He likes to give away some alpha.

222
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,730
He just streams himself, you know, coding and everything.

223
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,140
You remember when you used to do that? Yeah, yeah. No, no,

224
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,440
but this was on the live. I did this on a live on Wednesday or Thursday.

225
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,510
And this is Black Shoals, correct? Yeah, it's Black Shoals, correct.

226
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,140
And Red, I wouldn't get too caught up in all those fancy formulas, man.

227
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,200
The formula doesn't give you the edge. What gives you the edge is your value.

228
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,900
A 30 implied vol might be a 35 implied vol using a Heston model,

229
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,900
but all your vols are gonna be skewed.

230
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,360
So the only thing it's actually good for, let's say having a better model,

231
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,480
maybe a model with a backbone, or you can go further and further down the road,

232
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,770
is your hedging. So the way you calculate your deltas, all your Greeks,

233
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,570
that's where it could be useful. But as a prop trader, as a positional trader,

234
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,640
don't get lost in the weeds there.

235
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,000
Focus your time on where you're really gonna make some alpha.

236
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,950
What about for spreads with more than two legs, like an iron condor?

237
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,980
You'd have to price them individually.

238
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,240
So we used to have it where you could price the whole thing,

239
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,430
but maybe for down the road, we're gonna do that.

240
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,830
I have my own thing where I have them all priced out,

241
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,210
but people just weren't using it. It's a little bit of a hassle to build out.

242
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,910
So, but if you guys end up needing it, we can always throw it up there.

243
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,850
I have the code for it.

244
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,560
Ned, good of you to join us. We're just wrapping up.

245
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:53,560
Ned, generous guy, Ned. I still can't get over it, man. What? No,

246
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,060
just a little inside joke between Ned and I.

247
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,730
Whatever.

248
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,800
Okay, guys. I think that's gonna be it for tonight's live.

249
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:13,430
If you have any questions, just drop them in the chat and take it easy.

250
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,330
We'll see you tomorrow.
