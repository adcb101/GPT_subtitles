1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,620
Okay guys, so in today's lecture first off, how is everyone doing?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,200
Hope you guys are doing fantastic.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,250
It's a wonderful day Wonderful day here in Toronto We're gonna be looking over two

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:13,530
things.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,330
So I'm just gonna briefly show you guys what I'm working on right now and Also,

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,370
we're gonna be talking about the concept of forward volatility. Okay,

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,720
this is gonna be your calendar spreads These are two topics that we're gonna be

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,080
discussing today.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:42,920
So let me just jump in I'm gonna share my screen so This is a really good paper.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm gonna link I'm gonna put it in the group That's what I'm working on right now.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,650
And it is basically how to get more value out of a signal. Okay,

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,710
so let's say Let's say you have a predictor variable.

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:03,020
So your variable is 52 week high so what you do is you say well at every 52 week

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,900
high what happens to the stock afterwards and Let's say when there's a 52 week high

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,170
the stock moves up a week after you would say that the 52 week high is a good predictor

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,040
of The next week return. All right.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,920
So every time you get a 52 week high you buy the stock and that that is your indicator

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,650
Now what this what this person has done his name is David Aaronson What he's done

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:36,310
is he has figured a way to get more value out of these indicators and this is what

20
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,220
I mean So he will take an indicator. Let me just pull it up here.

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,790
Sorry guys I'm gonna link the paper down below.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,600
So he will take an indicator like this,

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,220
which is the basically the the AAI which is Okay,

24
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,270
I think it's like the investment association where they basically go around They

25
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,690
basically go around to investment advisors and they say are you bullish or bearish

26
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,090
on the market?

27
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,840
how bullish or how bearish are you on the market and they get a hundred or a thousand

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,560
investment advisors to give their opinion and They create a sentiment indicator.

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,400
So they say well You know 88% of people are bullish but it's investment advisors

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,830
It's professionals and they come up with this indicator now This indicator on its

31
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:36,830
own It's not actually that valuable and there's two reasons why One it's called

32
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,950
there is a trend right it there is um You can see kind of trends right kind of goes

33
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,330
up like this and then it trends down like this down over here So that's one the

34
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,630
other reason it has time varying volatility Meaning it might be more volatile here

35
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,360
than it was over here. So on its own It's not a good predictor,

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,060
but if we detrend it Okay,

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,300
and we remove the time varying volatility doing some you know,

38
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:17,920
some modeling we actually turn this indicator Into this indicator and what he finds

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
is once you actually detrend and remove the time-varying volatility for some of

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,060
these Assets or some of these indicators you actually can get a really good prediction

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,760
well, not really good because in the market, it's very The edge is very small,

42
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,350
but you can get a pretty good prediction on You know future stock returns.

43
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,630
Okay, so he does it for a couple things, right?

44
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:47,270
So here's the regular data and then here is it detrended and time time-varying volatility

45
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,740
removed Even does it on the VIX? So you guys might like that one.

46
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Here's the VIX Once you detrend it remove the time-varying volatility,

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,620
but you guys can see there's no volatility here But there's a ton of volatility

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,720
over here you get this and we can actually use this signal now to get a better Indication

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,060
of where the markets going.

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,360
So that's what I'm working on right now I Show you guys that we need to join what

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:24,080
is on the the y-axis there Axis here is actually something called a zed score.

52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,970
So it everything is now turned into How far how far did this thing move away?

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,960
Given there's no trend and The volatility is constant. Yeah,

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,380
so you turn it into a mean reverting asset exactly and it's these are standard deviations

55
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,020
Zed score is a standard deviation, right? So if we see number two here,

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,490
this is a two standard deviation move to the upside Or in this case two standard

57
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,560
deviations away from everything else right,

58
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,360
so we we create it into a stationary asset meaning volatility and the mean is the

59
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,750
same across time And there's something like super important When you're doing when

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,150
you're trying to quantitative modeling quantitative trading You're building out

61
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,250
your own products building out your own systems This is gonna be really helpful.

62
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,950
Took me a while to like really get into this stuff.

63
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,820
It's really helpful It's really really helpful. Yeah,

64
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:35,150
this is like you're two or three or five or never So let's jump into We're gonna

65
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,410
go over forward volatilities.

66
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,040
I think you guys are gonna find this pretty interesting Let me just log into thinkorswim

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,520
here guys.

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,940
Okay, so while that loads So let's go over to vol trader.

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,420
We're gonna look at This term structure here. Okay,

70
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,200
so we're gonna look at Apple Apple had earnings today.

71
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,160
So this is right before Apple's close So we're gonna be looking at data today before

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,700
the earnings announcement. What do you guys notice about this?

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,500
So this is the so let me explain this first.

74
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,310
This is the implied volatility term structure Meaning how is the why where's the

75
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,130
implied volatility through time?

76
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,100
Okay. So for example,

77
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:36,720
this is the 10-day implied volatility This is the 20-day implied volatility 60 90

78
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,080
120 to 52 So a really basic way to think about this for the guys that are familiar

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,710
with skew like maybe to conceptualize in your mind When we look at the skew graph,

80
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,460
we look across the option chain right,

81
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,720
so we look at like all the different strikes for one for like one set of days to

82
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,620
expiration and We look at how the volatility changes across that surface With the

83
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,750
term structure we're looking this way. So we're looking through time Right,

84
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,750
so one we're looking across all for a given time period and then we're looking at

85
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,590
given the set How does it change based on different sets as we go through time?

86
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,920
Exactly Just so just so what Sean's saying here if you guys want to see it on the

87
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:40,540
chain itself Co is saying like if you merge the two you get a 3d graph of the The

88
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,720
option. Yeah. Yeah, what ballast of that for sure, right?

89
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,920
No koa saying that actually yeah,

90
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,380
so you actually get a 3d So I'll show you guys what the surface actually looks like

91
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,150
I think we've pulled this up once before Yeah,

92
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:03,160
it was like a 3d model like a wave or no. We were looking at a Yeah,

93
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,500
I think I think we were looking at that. You're looking like can't remember.

94
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,650
Okay, so this is what the option chain actually looks like Yeah,

95
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,770
Neil those for Boma,

96
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,040
okay,

97
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:49,720
let's get a local vol model here instead Yeah,

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,360
well any any of these are right,

99
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,900
but I thought I saw one that was really good before Anyways, well,

100
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,780
let's take a look at this.

101
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,690
So this is basically gonna be I wish I could make this big guys.

102
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:21,580
So Here is let's say days to expiration on the on the x-axis here Y axis is implied

103
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,210
volatility. I'm sorry. The Zed act.

104
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,540
This is the Zed axis is implied volatility and This is the y-axis and this is the

105
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,070
Zed axis Okay,

106
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:37,050
and you can see this is exactly what Apple's what Apple would look like high implied

107
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,810
volatility at the front low implied volatility at the back and Then through time

108
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,870
we and then sorry through the skew.

109
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,780
We see that the calls are much cheaper than the puts Okay,

110
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,900
so this is what the 3d surface This is what the option chain if you were to put

111
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,020
every single option and plot it all this is what it looks like Okay,

112
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,540
and you guys are trading one of these So let's say you come into the options market

113
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,780
and you and you like this one right over here You sell this one.

114
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:18,670
You're selling this on the whole surface So here we have the y-axis is the implied

115
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:25,750
vol the x-axis is the days to expiration Why does can someone tell me why it looks

116
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,190
like this?

117
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:36,980
And I'm so upset. I poured some cereal It's soggy Cereal soggy, but whatever.

118
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,720
Okay. Why does the why is the implied vol surface look like this?

119
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:52,040
Let's see John do you freeze? Oh, no, I'm here. I'm here. Okay.

120
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,750
I thought you froze Let's just looking at something Okay Event ball in the front

121
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,320
exactly,

122
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,480
right there is a Event that's happening tomorrow and this option is way higher.

123
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,580
But let me ask you guys a question though Let's really try to think about this.

124
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,850
This option is gonna see the event But why but this option is also gonna see the

125
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,860
event why is this one higher Right,

126
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,760
if we look at the option chain this options these options are gonna see the event,

127
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,560
but so are these ones Events tomorrow. This is October.

128
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,870
This is gonna experience the event Why is it that this one we look at the implied

129
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,110
volatility is so much higher, right?

130
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:58,580
This is 98% and this is only 41 why is it code saying because people are rushing

131
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,680
to be a part of it? Okay Anyone else?

132
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,720
What do you guys think disagree agree with code?

133
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,070
Steven saying IVs calculated per day 10 days one event more than 120 days three

134
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,990
events The further ones are and then shakes is saying the further ones are exposed

135
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,710
to longer-term vol versus tomorrow's one with fall That is mainly because of earnings

136
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,130
Siddhartha saying earning or event vol is currently factored in but not for the

137
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,380
later months Okay,

138
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,720
I think Steve I think Steve hit it I think Steve hit it so let me just pull up the

139
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:50,210
whiteboard here You got it there So

140
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,370
we're gonna have our front our first week option one week option. Okay,

141
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,500
this option is gonna have five days Actually, we're gonna say three days Okay,

142
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,540
we're gonna call it DTE days to expiration.

143
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,520
You guys gotta get familiar with with the terminology three days to expiration We're

144
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:23,330
gonna have another option that has 50 days 50 DT Okay,

145
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:35,330
the implied vol for this Implied vol is gonna equal to 30% here,

146
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:48,100
but it's going to equal to Guys, I'm pulling up a notepad here.

147
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
This is not a big fan.

148
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:05,630
Not a big fan of that whiteboard What's happening Jordan? Sorry guys.

149
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,370
I'm gonna switch right? I'm not a big fan of that whiteboard.

150
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,170
I'm gonna switch over to white pages here One sec,

151
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:54,040
let's make that big so we can all see we got option one three DT IV is

152
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:10,540
gonna be we call it IV one is gonna equal to 80% option 250 DT IV

153
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,370
is good IV two is gonna equal to 30% so we have two options one expiring in three

154
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,880
days like Apple and one expiring in 50 days with only 30% and So some of you guys

155
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,800
are saying it's because everyone's rushing to buy these options Well,

156
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,720
if that were the case What we could do is we could sell these options and buy these

157
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,500
options and capture almost a risk-free profit Leave more like this if this Was was

158
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,920
this if this was factoring in a move?

159
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,040
But this wasn't we could just buy this sell this and we capture we'd capture a free

160
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,690
move Right.

161
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,890
So obviously the market sometimes it does that sometimes they'll give us some inefficiencies,

162
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,000
but very rare so we need to understand what's really happening here and Steve said

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,360
it great if you have an option with three days to expiration It's gonna be more

164
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,980
sensitive to that event. Okay?

165
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,860
Let's break it down one step further This option has three days.

166
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:18,710
It has a 3% move It has a 2% move priced in on day one a 2% move Priced in on day

167
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,670
two and then on day three it has the earnings event Okay,

168
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:32,750
now what is volatility it's the average of all the days It's the average volatility

169
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,670
of all the days.

170
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:40,880
So can someone tell me what is the What is the implied daily move on this option?

171
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,950
What is the implied over the next three days? What is the implied daily move?

172
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,850
Yeah, okay, yeah,

173
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,580
I don't know I just I don't know if I cut out or you cut out no no I was waiting

174
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,940
for the guys guys.

175
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,000
What is the what is the implied daily move with an 80% option over the next three

176
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,300
days?

177
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,800
Kyle said it 5% right Raph. Remember it's the volatility Divided by 16.

178
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,250
So in plot, so the implied vol is 16 is 80 we divide by 16 Okay,

179
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,630
and that means every single day the market is expecting a 5% move 5% move and a

180
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,680
5% move Okay. Now let's I'm gonna keep asking You guys questions here.

181
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,490
Does this make sense? Does this make sense?

182
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,170
Apple has earnings tomorrow and the market is 80% vol and it's implying 5% 5% 5

183
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,890
% Does that make sense?

184
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,600
No, it doesn't make sense Right.

185
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,860
It does that doesn't make sense Instead we said it's 2% 2% and then the earnings

186
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,140
event So if the average has to be 5, what is this earnings event?

187
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,890
What is the implied move here? Well,

188
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,440
this has this has to equal 15.

189
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,190
So the implied move here, right? We got five five five Right,

190
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,100
the average has to equal five. Yes, the guys are saying 11 11.

191
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:54,290
This has to equal 11 so it's 80% because the average is 5% and The missing number

192
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:02,580
here is the implied move number and that's 11% Costing why are there he's got it.

193
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,070
It's got three DT Now, let's look at a 50-day option Okay, actually,

194
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,050
you know what because 50 is gonna have too many numbers let's just do let's just

195
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:23,030
do eight Okay, let's just do eight. Okay now What happens if we did like this?

196
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:31,600
2% 2% 2% Right because these are these days these 2% days are the non event volatility.

197
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,380
It's the non event.

198
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:44,780
So 2% 2% 2% what we got here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 And then we have the implied move which

199
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,800
we said is 11% Okay, sorry about this this IV number.

200
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,290
Let's get rid of that for now Okay,

201
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,070
so for the 30-day option or the 8-day option,

202
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,470
can we all agree that this is what it looks like?

203
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,280
Can we all agree that this is what it looks like?

204
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,840
we have seven days of non events and one day of the of the 11% both these options

205
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,400
have the 11% move if it has to be if this Was let's say 5% you could buy this and

206
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:24,060
sell this This has to be 11% So what's the volatility here?

207
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,660
What is the implied volatility for this 8-day option?

208
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:40,560
Neil saying 50 Let's see new two four six eight ten twelve fourteen 25 25 divided

209
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,000
by 8. What do you got there?

210
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:53,570
What's 25 divided by 8? 3.1 3.1 2 5. Yeah, 3.1 2 5 Okay,

211
00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:03,960
3.1 2 5 times 16 Neil hit right on the head 50 the volatility for this option is

212
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:16,070
50% So it's not because this one's more expensive or people are rushing into this

213
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,830
one. It's because Volatility is the average.

214
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:22,920
Okay,

215
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,000
just the first thing we have to go with understand before we talk about forward

216
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
volatility So,

217
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,510
let me know if you guys have any questions about this Go ahead a very important

218
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,510
question. He's like, okay now, how do we make money with this? Cool I love it.

219
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,950
I love it man. I love your attitude. You always oh, well,

220
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,300
no your practitioner You show me the money. I Like it. Okay.

221
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:58,460
Does anyone else have questions about this because we need to understand this you

222
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,830
know, I didn't I didn't see your I didn't see your answer,

223
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,440
but it was because the Because it's more sensitive.

224
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,620
It has less days to expiration So the volatility of the event volatility has a bigger

225
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,880
impact on the option price Right, imagine this was a 1 DTE option. Okay,

226
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,660
what would the volatility be of this option?

227
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,990
If if it was a 1 DTE option first first guy gets get gets gets the money Well,

228
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,510
we're traders here.

229
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,960
We gotta be quick What's what's the IV of this option 1 DTE?

230
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:38,480
It has earnings in it Come on guys one color saying 15. No, it's saying 80.

231
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh my goodness. Come on guys. We got this. Come on Really guys?

232
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,810
Are we just throwing numbers here?

233
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,280
Who said it Siddharth Steven beautiful.

234
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,620
It's 11% because it's got the earnings event and Only one day times 16, right?

235
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:08,900
This is it's just it's just this so the volatility would be 176% Okay,

236
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,720
so that's why you see that's why you see this on Apple.

237
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,970
Oh, I thought you were a mathematician dude. What happened?

238
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,560
only complex equations a no, uh No arithmetic. Okay.

239
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:34,660
That's why we see this That's why the 100 252-day option is this low still has the

240
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,660
event priced in it But it's it's it's not gonna move the needle when when the event

241
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,320
comes down It's gonna be diluted or it's gonna be diluted by all the other regular

242
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,600
day-to-day activity But this is gonna be the most sensitive So once we're up,

243
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,780
let me see I'm gonna give him one more second Just to make sure you guys understand

244
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,620
it fully any questions and then we're gonna go into forward ball Which I think is

245
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,220
really eye-opening for it was eye-opening for me. Hopefully, you know,

246
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,370
it's eye-opening for you guys Looks like we're good to go good to go.

247
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:13,560
Nice so What is this concept of forward volatility? Well,

248
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,560
let me ask you guys a question.

249
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:28,020
Let's go back to the white page Once let's let's say we're looking at this two options

250
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:35,050
here. We're looking at this One DT one DT option and this a DT e option. Okay,

251
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,160
we're looking at these two right here What is the market implying?

252
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,950
between these events So what happens we look actually we look over here what happens

253
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:56,310
after this After after this expiration is gone Where is this volatility gonna be

254
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,700
what's gonna happen to it? What is gonna happen once? You know,

255
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,640
even if it wasn't an event, but what's gonna happen once it's gone, right?

256
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:16,900
Let's look at the S&P that doesn't have this type of term structure Okay What's

257
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,880
gonna we know the implied volatility for the 60-day option and we know the implied

258
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,020
volatility for the 90-day option But what's gonna happen in between 60 and 90 days?

259
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,530
Right think about like this. So yeah,

260
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,010
I feel like Sean would explain this better But I'm gonna I'm gonna try to pull Sean

261
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,450
here and explain this real up explain this good You get to the whiteboard.

262
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,240
So here we are today Sorry, here we are 90 days from now.

263
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,020
Okay,

264
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:20,550
here's 60 and then here is the future So this is the 90-day option.

265
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:26,600
This is the 60-day option and this is Zero. Okay,

266
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:38,500
and let's say the IV for the 60-day option is 30 and this is 40 Well,

267
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,420
what is this telling us? Well,

268
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,640
this 60-day option is saying from 60 days until zero days we are gonna have 30 percent

269
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:57,470
volatility and this 90-day option is Telling us that from 90 days until zero days.

270
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,290
We are gonna have 40% volatility,

271
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:14,120
but what about the volatility between 30 and 40?

272
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,800
What is happening in here? Because if we think about it guys,

273
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,570
I should have done this in a different color. I mean Okay,

274
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,310
whatever if we think about it Rosie and then it'll erase the last line. Yeah,

275
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,310
or command Z Do you know how to change color?

276
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:40,180
Just do it at the top Is it format, uh-huh?

277
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:42,980
Okay,

278
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:49,340
so here's this the option now I'm gonna be blown away and be blown away if someone

279
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,620
can tell me What is wrong here? What's wrong here? What is what?

280
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,440
What is misleading between these two options?

281
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,740
I actually might use I might honestly I might stop the live.

282
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,660
I might stop the live and just say go go learn from this person What is wrong here?

283
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,770
Okay. Well while I think of that Sean should I grab my charger?

284
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:21,490
What are you guys thinking Um,

285
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,790
yeah Jordan go through an example that again Because I when you went away from the

286
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,110
computer, I may have paused the recording and not got that Okay, gotcha.

287
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:41,630
Gotcha So we got two So Sean, are you saying I should do? This is zero or no.

288
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,130
Yeah losing now. I'll be too confusing now. No, no, no go back Okay,

289
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:59,320
so here is zero okay over here we have 60 DT Okay,

290
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,060
and we got 90 and I'm not gonna draw as many lines on this this time guys So you

291
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,190
guys can maybe get a little more better picture of it.

292
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,770
So we got 90 DT Actually,

293
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:24,270
I'm gonna let you guys fill this in This option has IV of let's say 20 and this

294
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:37,880
has IV 80 so here this option is saying 20% volatility over the next 60 days 20

295
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:46,220
% volatility and This option is saying 80% volatility over the 90 days okay,

296
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,780
so I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna draw.

297
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:55,800
I think it's gonna be too much So if this is saying 80 IV and this is saying 20

298
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,920
What do you guys think the IV is gonna be in here in this region?

299
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,150
What do you think the forward volatility is gonna be in this region?

300
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,740
Call was saying 120 It's gonna be high.

301
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,740
We don't know there's a formula for it We don't know the exact number right now

302
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,230
Okay,

303
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,890
but it's gonna be damn high it's gonna be extremely extremely high and yeah I'll

304
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:28,320
do the I'll do the code super quick. So forward vol. Okay,

305
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,790
and guys is the forward vol It's gonna be coming on the terminal as well So you

306
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,850
guys can do calendar spreads is that no one was in gold and we haven't really talked

307
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,280
about it. So It wasn't in there.

308
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,820
But anyways It could be in the couple hundreds. Yeah, it's gonna be huge.

309
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,040
It's gonna be absolutely huge, right?

310
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,620
It's gonna be like and we have it or something. Yeah,

311
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:57,960
so we said how many 60 and 90 6 So it's gonna be a hundred and thirty five percent.

312
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:04,580
You can see right down here a Hundred and thirty five percent is gonna be the volatility

313
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,900
inside Inside this region.

314
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,300
Okay,

315
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:28,070
but over the average over the 90-day period It's gonna average out to 80 Okay,

316
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:28,990
it's gonna average out to 80,

317
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:37,520
but we're gonna see 135 here and we're gonna see 20 here.

318
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,660
So to answer Koha's question out. How do we make money on this? Well,

319
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,540
we would look we would say well,

320
00:31:45,580 --> 00:32:01,100
let's let let's take a look at a stock Let's take a look at a stock Okay,

321
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,820
this is this isn't volatility,

322
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:12,090
but we can pretend this volatility Let's say this is realized volatility and we

323
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:19,640
notice that forward volatility is only 70 It's only point seven zero the forward

324
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,640
vol. Let's say between the 60 and the 120 option 70 well,

325
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,840
we know Once that option goes once once that one up once the first option expires

326
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,580
The back option is gonna be worth 70 implied vol.

327
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,540
That's what the market's saying Now, let me ask you guys a question.

328
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:53,000
Does 70% implied vol make sense on this graph Khoa's

329
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,280
saying it's cheap Cheap What we do? Yep. So what can we do?

330
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,720
We can sell the front we can buy forward vol Okay,

331
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,660
that's the answer we can buy forward vol But how do we do it?

332
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,720
We can't go to the market say hey,

333
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,970
give me some forward vol We have to create it.

334
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,350
So we can do is we can buy a calendar we can sell the front and buy the back and

335
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,410
Once this goes as once this gets closer and closer and closer and let's say this

336
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,830
falls off eventually This is gonna get repriced to let's say I don't know maybe

337
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:27,820
120 110 but you bought it when it was at 70 You bought the forward vol at 70 and

338
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,340
now it's 120.

339
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,420
Okay,

340
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,940
so that's how we can trade calendars to make Make good cash to make good money,

341
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,620
right? We gotta find that inefficiency in the market Obviously,

342
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,880
I'm sure you guys just think just for me telling you guys this is like how do I

343
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,840
do this? Right,

344
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,680
and that's why that's why it can be done right because you can't just go out and

345
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,840
do it You can't even use think or swim to do it. No,

346
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,020
no one's looking at forward vol.

347
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,460
So for that reason You can definitely make money on there,

348
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,350
right it's a relative value play But you're selling the back buying you're selling

349
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:13,160
the front buying the back you're buying forward volatility for the future So what

350
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,240
do you guys think was I was that eye-opening? Was that really cool?

351
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:22,280
What do you guys think? You guys think it's really cool Yeah,

352
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,040
the guys are liking it. So it's still a little confused Okay. Well,

353
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
that's why we're here. That's why we're here. What are we confused on?

354
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,660
What are we confused about? Yeah,

355
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,820
and like I also get like that sometimes with concepts like this you need to sit

356
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,540
in them for a bit yeah, you know,

357
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,350
it's not like you're gonna like you're not gonna walk out of this lecture and You

358
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,790
know have it down pat But what I do recommend is I'm hoping that all of you have

359
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:50,160
a paper account at least on the side Try to think of an idea Right.

360
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Let's chat about this tomorrow during the market See if you can find anything and

361
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,930
if there is Then uh, you know,

362
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,730
maybe try and start will help you try and structure trade.

363
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,430
That'll be the easiest way to learn But also Jordan what I was just thinking was

364
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,970
if you want to go back to the terminal and show them Are you able to see this in

365
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,650
the term structure?

366
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,340
No, it's gonna be it's gonna be in the new one. You could bring up the new one.

367
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,160
Yeah, okay Yeah, it's gonna be the new one.

368
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,200
There's actually gonna be a forward full column.

369
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,480
It's gonna be different But there's different forward falls, right?

370
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,580
there's forward vol between the 20 day in the 30 day between 20 in the 90 day between

371
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,400
the 30 day in the 60 between the 60 in the 10.

372
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,760
There's so many combos And so we're gonna have a whole bunch of combos we actually

373
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:41,760
have a forward ball section for calendar spreads But quickly guys,

374
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,260
what is the you guys take a guess?

375
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,160
What is the forward vol between the 20 and the 50-day option here? Okay,

376
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
we're looking at let's just look at the calls here Yeah,

377
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,010
let's look at the calls and let's look at the okay.

378
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,990
What what do you guys think the forward vol is here?

379
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,470
Between the 20 and the 50.

380
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,840
Okay, so is this still the whiteboard guys?

381
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Dude, how the hell did Neil see it then?

382
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,260
Yes You have to be kidding me Nellie took a guess and you got it, right man.

383
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:49,320
Don't kill me, dude I think I've been sharing.

384
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,760
I think I've been talking sharing my screen sharing the wrong screen for quite a

385
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,120
while Actually, I didn't know you had anything else open. It's so funny.

386
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,600
I thought we were just chatting Okay, fuck you ruined it.

387
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:10,050
I gotta get a new one. I can't leave That's hilarious Okay. Okay 20 and 50-day.

388
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,050
What is the what is the forward vol here guys between the 20 and the 50?

389
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:35,400
We're just looking at the calls for the Nasdaq You'll

390
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,640
say 20 again. No, because it's not 20 at this time. Neil. Haha.

391
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:51,420
Nice try bud Think if thing you can fool me twice a What's the forward vol here

392
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,040
guys super quick?

393
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,620
52 no to pricey 30. Yeah, so Siddharth saying closer It's gonna be above 24,

394
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,340
right because think about like this We're saying this 50-day option is saying this

395
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:13,130
it's gonna have 22 out of the 50 days It's gonna have 22 days that are 22 percent

396
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:19,280
volatility meaning in order to get 24 We're gonna have to have something bigger

397
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,020
than 24 for it to average out 22 plus something bigger than 22 has to average out

398
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:30,170
To 24 and so the forward vol here we just do it super quick and I can send you guys

399
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:43,290
the code if you want it So we got 22 24 20 50 it's gonna be 25.2 Okay.

400
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:52,370
So now you ask yourself the question You ask yourself the question in 20 days When

401
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:57,600
this is gone, do you think the September volatility?

402
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,640
So when it's at 30 DTE now,

403
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,710
do you think it will be 25.2 if your answer is yes There's no trade if you think

404
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,280
it's gonna be 19 Then you'd want to sell the back by the front if you think it's

405
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,600
gonna be 45 You would sell the front by the back.

406
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:19,940
Okay,

407
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,260
so that is the forward volatility Hope you guys hope you guys learned a little bit

408
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,800
about it So it's you know,

409
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,300
and then you just so let's say like let's say we thought it was cheap Okay,

410
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,680
we come in we buy calendar spread and you guys can see how this is gonna go through

411
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,040
time So let's say yeah, let me just cancel this. Okay,

412
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,090
so you guys are gonna see how this is gonna actually move So let's say we get closer

413
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,790
and closer to expiration.

414
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:52,080
Okay closer and closer and closer and closer and closer and closer As we get closer

415
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,600
the market starts to reprice that forward fall,

416
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:02,210
but what's gonna happen back is gonna start pumping up Backs gonna start going up

417
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,510
going up going up. Let's say we think it's 30 vol Should be 30 forward fall.

418
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,780
That's gonna start pumping up pumping up pumping up and we end up with something

419
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,560
like this Okay,

420
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,080
and this is why gold calendars are gold because they're so multidimensional You're

421
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,750
so multidimensional Cool,

422
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:29,340
so we're gonna leave it at that Hope you guys enjoyed you guys enjoyed this You

423
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,580
know when I first learned about forward volatility, it was very cool for me.

424
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:39,110
Hope you guys find it cool as well Can you so Koha saying?

425
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,590
Okay, Koha. I'm gonna get back to that then. Okay,

426
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,470
cuz that's gonna be for the end.

427
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,770
Oh wait George Why can't we use term structure for this?

428
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Why can't we use term structure?

429
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,560
This is the term structure to give me a little more info there This is the term

430
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,600
structure, right?

431
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,280
This is this through time volatility through time if you mean like why can't we

432
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,100
use the forward ball?

433
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,690
Okay So you have to be able to calculate the forward ball.

434
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:18,270
So what I'll do I'm gonna put a forward ball a forward ball calculator So you can

435
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,440
for example have the calculator window right here And then you could see well What

436
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,840
is the forward ball between this and that so you type in the numbers and then that

437
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,660
would come the forward ball?

438
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,040
Right you you can look at it here But I don't have the actual calculator in there,

439
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,140
but I can put it in no problem,

440
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:43,880
right I'm just guys reminder like this terminal was originally built To get people

441
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,680
excited about trading get people to get into trading right away and start making

442
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,280
money, right?

443
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,050
That was the original Idea behind this terminal the new one though. Yeah,

444
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,520
I wasn't to overwhelm you That's gonna you guys will you guys will be finding new

445
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,610
stuff out about it a year from now Okay,

446
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:09,680
and then koa saying Koa saying can you explain why vol went from 68 to 42 in seven

447
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,200
days and then jump back to?

448
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,790
Then jump back to 82, so let's take a look Let's take a look real quick,

449
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:29,530
isn't it guys how amazing is it though that Amazon is Dominates the Nasdaq it dominates

450
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,730
the Nasdaq so much that the move move the whole Nasdaq Yeah The Apple jump to that

451
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,180
right? Yeah, it's unbelievable Well,

452
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,580
it would've been such a good long vol trade guys, and it was cheap.

453
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,520
We should have bought some but We love being short gamma.

454
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:56,150
Let's take a look koa and actually I'm gonna show you guys how much money you can

455
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,120
make selling vol Okay,

456
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,120
you guys are gonna be blown away blown away Let's take a look.

457
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,740
So koa I never actually jumped backed up and never jumped back up.

458
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,260
It stayed low.

459
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:16,870
Let's go back to Let's go back to this date Jan 13 Okay,

460
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:20,230
I know everyone's excited about price and a lot of you guys here now are starting

461
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,850
to get excited about vol I'm gonna get a little I'm gonna get a little more exciting

462
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,490
for you guys. Okay,

463
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:42,200
and make it a little bit more exciting Okay,

464
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,140
let's see what happens when we sell vol at a reasonably high price on Tesla and

465
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:54,860
we sell let's say Let's call it November fall just like we're doing with SLV.

466
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,760
Let's say we sold a straddle Okay,

467
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,080
so we have no theta so you can't say realize volatility was low. Okay,

468
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:13,510
we're gonna be looking strictly at implied vol Look at this guys Look what happens

469
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:13,710
here?

470
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:29,240
Our straddle goes from seven hundred and seventeen dollars all the way down all

471
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:39,260
the way down to five hundred and ten bucks You lose two lose Was it 40% of the straddle

472
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:50,870
in two weeks in a week and a half a 40% of a $750 straddle in two weeks.

473
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,740
That's that's huge Right.

474
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,580
Obviously you have to put up a lot of money for this But it's just if you're on

475
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:05,260
the long side Let's say you are you're buying vol you can make 40% on a number longer

476
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,860
dated options have a lot They're a lot more expensive.

477
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:14,560
So if you make for example on our on our SLV trade We're already up 15% on a six

478
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,550
dollar straddle way back right on a $21 $20 stock So you can make a ton of money

479
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,370
on implied volatility a ton unrealized vol on volatility trading you make a ton

480
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:30,970
of money It's there There is a lot of money to be made and not a lot of people are

481
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,200
looking at this All right,

482
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:42,540
you guys know that it's just our group John anything you want to say I'm gonna end

483
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,700
the live there at 650 No, it was good stuff,
