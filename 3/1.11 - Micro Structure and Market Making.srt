00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,560
perfect What do you mean I for discord yeah,

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,400
I had to choose a different setting Okay, guys, let's jump into it.

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,460
So Sean is not gonna be here today.

19
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,900
So it's just me hosting the lecture we're gonna be talking about market making microstructure

20
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,240
and You know try to give you guys more understanding of how this how the markets

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,900
actually working,

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,100
you know You're always in there placing orders buying and selling and if you can

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,080
understand how this how this whole thing is working Of course, you know,

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,700
it's so complex,

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,360
but if you can get a general grasp of how this thing is working Then you can do

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,140
better going forward right remember strategies change right markets change strategies

27
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,380
change straight change And so you have to be fully equipped to be able to take on

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,380
new events that come up Okay, and by understanding how markets work,

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,460
you can obviously be more equipped to do that.

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,860
Keep in mind guys This is a silver course. So a silver lecture.

31
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,340
So I'm assuming that A Lot of you guys already know what I'm gonna be talking about

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,580
some of the words. I'm going to be using and So for the bronze guys,

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,420
if you don't understand it,

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,560
that's totally fine These are all being recorded and you can work your way up to

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,060
to silver eventually All right.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,060
So let's jump into it's great to see a nice little turnout here so what we're gonna

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,200
start with guys is We're gonna be talking about Working orders,

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,820
okay So I know sometimes you guys see me,

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,420
you know I've heard like a hundred lots and it's like I've been doing it all day

40
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,080
trying to get filled But I spent three hours trying to get filled and let's say

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm trading an illiquid market it like takes up my whole day right or 150 lots and

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,280
There's a reason for it. Okay,

43
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm gonna go over here and show you what usually I'm doing because so not all the

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,500
time I'm trading in liquid markets,

45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,900
but sometimes I am trading illiquid markets and we're gonna go over why sometimes

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,970
I trade them and What's really happening with the market makers here? Okay,

47
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,130
so just wanna make sure everyone can see my screen if you can't see my screen Just

48
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,970
comment down below. I know we've got some new guys here.

49
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:49,370
Let me open up the Let me open up the live recordings Okay So yeah,

50
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,330
if you guys you have a question write down in the live record in the live chat Write

51
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,530
it down in the live chat just above this video and I'll be able to to see it there

52
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,630
Okay,

53
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,590
I usually have Sean checking that for me so if I don't get to it right away,

54
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,180
sorry about that guys So what we see here is here's an option chain. Okay,

55
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,900
so I'm in my interactive brokers account and here's an option chain I'm looking

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,580
at QSR and We're I'm getting quoted the bids and being quoted on the ask,

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,080
right?

58
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,340
So there's a market maker behind this screen who has a fair price for volatility

59
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,800
and he's pricing on both sides Okay,

60
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,040
so this is probably TD Bank right now Right,

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,000
so you can go in and see on the exchange who is who are the big market makers?

62
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,600
So,

63
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,840
you know in the in the equities markets is usually Citadel or Susquehanna But in

64
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,140
the Canadian market it is let's say TD. Okay,

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,800
there's actually only four market makers in in Canada Okay,

66
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,460
so here we're gonna see So if we're looking if we're looking right over here,

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,540
for example, the market maker is quoting.

68
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,580
So let's look at the 64 option He's quoting the bid at 35 cents and the ask at $3

69
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,220
and 30 cents So what that means is he's willing to buy at 35 cents and he's willing

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,700
to sell at $3 and 30 cents Now this is so wide.

71
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,420
This market is so wide and basically, you know,

72
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,030
my edge is gonna be gone If I'm trying to trade in this thing,

73
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,650
right if I think balls under price, for example,

74
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,520
my edge is gonna be gone So I have to try to you know,

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,970
I have to try to find find a way to get this in market maker to take my order Okay.

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:39,550
Yeah Yeah Sure, it's it's pretty much full screen on my end.

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,190
Let me see here mark. Let me see That's the best I can do Yeah,

78
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,310
that's good guys. Okay, perfect. Okay for some reason on my screen.

79
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,930
It looks like it's almost full screen I don't know why but anyways It's full screen

80
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,850
now. So We can see it.

81
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,570
We're all good so market makers quoting a bid and he's quoting an ask right and

82
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,530
What he's saying here is fair value is somewhere in between So this is a first off.

83
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:15,110
This is a very illiquid option chain very illiquid and he's saying Fair value to

84
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,730
him is somewhere in between this number Okay,

85
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,670
so if we're looking at the 35 cents and $3.30,

86
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,750
it's somewhere in this number and what he's doing is he's putting 20 lots on the

87
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,580
bid Okay, so if I put in a market order for 20 lots I'd get filled instantly,

88
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,700
okay, he has 20 lots there He also has 20 lots on the ask Okay.

89
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,920
So if I want to went to buy this I get 20 I get filled 20 lots right away And then

90
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,160
we don't know what come in behind that so this is We'll say this is one market maker

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,590
now. I Need to get a better film. Okay,

92
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,010
when you're treating an illiquid market, it's really tough.

93
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,090
Look at this We got the open interest is three Okay,

94
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,770
the open interest here is 19 Very illiquid.

95
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,820
So what you can do is You can come in and start pushing the market maker down.

96
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,700
Okay,

97
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,970
so I'm gonna do this live here for you guys So we're going to be trading the 72.

98
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,590
So the 72 is trading at $6. Okay,

99
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:33,580
so he's trading at six bucks So right now his ask is six Okay,

100
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,880
so I put in my order for $5.95 and he jumped me You see that he went from six to

101
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,680
five ninety and now he's quoting ten Okay,

102
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:58,480
so we're gonna keep it going So here he goes again. He jumps me again,

103
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,380
right and he's actually quoting his whole lot 20 lots right,

104
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,340
so this is think about it like The market maker is he's sitting there and he's saying

105
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,380
well if you give me 20 slices of pizza Okay,

106
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,080
like so this is the supply demand right if you give me 20 slices of pizza I'm satisfied.

107
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,720
I was craving pizza. And now I got 20.

108
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,540
I'm happy now once you're full the next 20 slices of pizza They don't taste as good

109
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,040
anymore Right.

110
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,200
So if I ding that 580 he all of a sudden he just ate the 20 slices of pizza and

111
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,520
now he's gonna move his market To show that right. He's gonna widen his spread.

112
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,500
Maybe he's gonna go 590 or $6.

113
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:52,920
So we're gonna keep bringing this guy down Right,

114
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,660
so we can just keep bringing him down bringing him down bringing him down until

115
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,140
there's a point There's a threshold where he's gonna knock him down anymore.

116
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,580
I Didn't do it in this video, but eventually he starts to join me.

117
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,870
So we go from let's say we go down to $5 now Instead of so let's say he's quoting.

118
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,430
Okay. So for example, let's say he's quoting 570 here.

119
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:21,660
I come in at 565 He's not gonna jump me and go to 560 Instead he's gonna join me

120
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,400
He's gonna join me at 565 Okay,

121
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:32,680
so let's say I quote a one lot and he's quoting 20 it's gonna go from I'm gonna

122
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,440
go at 565.

123
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,140
He's gonna join me So it's gonna be 21 lots at the ask and because I'm a retail

124
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,720
trader I get first dibs So if someone comes in and buys the option,

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,300
I would get first dibs on the sell before him Okay,

126
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,790
so this is this is this is how this game works So do you guys have any questions

127
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,470
about that?

128
00:09:53,050 --> 00:10:02,950
Because we're gonna we're gonna keep going deeper It's because I'm a retail I have

129
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:13,370
preference It's just the rules so That is correct.

130
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,190
If you if you were in a market maker So let's say it's you and me Neil that come

131
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,650
into the market and you were there first you'd get first dibs over me Okay,

132
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,370
but it's I can't remember the rule.

133
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:29,810
It's a Mark my nose better than me if you still if he does it's um I'll find it

134
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,490
for you Neil and I'll send it to you. But there for most exchanges.

135
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:45,860
There's a rule where The client gets the order before you do Okay Gotcha.

136
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,620
Perfect. Thanks mark. Okay,

137
00:10:47,840 --> 00:11:00,120
so you're gonna so you're gonna get filled first Okay, Neil Yeah And then yeah,

138
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:18,900
yeah jump in there Mm

139
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,200
-hmm.

140
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:23,650
Yeah,

141
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,830
and I think those are called A Price improvers because there's like there's sometimes

142
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,670
maybe not in super liquid markets,

143
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,910
but there's sometimes hidden liquidity where you get filled at the mid right Yeah

144
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,860
Mm-hmm.

145
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,300
No, no, no mark, you know, it's uh,

146
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,580
I think you have a little bit of your pretty knowledge on this Microstructure stuff.

147
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:38,440
So if you want to chime in go for it Awesome,

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,400
great So, yeah, so but if you guys can see here What's happening there? Right?

149
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,180
We have the market maker.

150
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,900
He's sitting on the bid and if I wanted to come in now for 20 lots I just got 30

151
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,960
cents better than when I first started right? It was five.

152
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,380
It's 570 rather than six dollars Now sometimes there is hidden liquidity that you

153
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,280
don't see But when you get into really really illiquid markets Usually there actually

154
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,160
is no hidden liquidity and I'm gonna explain what's happening here Okay,

155
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,660
so first off the less liquid you go the less market makers there are right thing

156
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,400
boys as um, if there's more competition Right,

157
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,020
and obviously what drives the competition is the volume but there's more competition

158
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,740
Then you're gonna have more market makers participating if you have less Competent

159
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,980
competition, right?

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,920
You're gonna have wider spreads and you're not gonna have people trying to get in

161
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,240
and out in between Right,

162
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,540
and so that's that's why we're seeing such widespread in In this market because

163
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,740
on this exchange really have four market makers that are you know Maybe not the

164
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,620
most sophisticated when we go on to something like, you know in the u.s.

165
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,100
Where we have extremely efficient exchanges with Citadel and Susquehanna running

166
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,180
the show over there, you know,

167
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,000
you're gonna have nice tight spreads And then also something in Canada as well is

168
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,150
that you can't have You have to be a designated market maker,

169
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,470
so you can't let's say I'm You know,

170
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,010
let's say I have enough money and I decide to quote both sides.

171
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,590
I can't do that Right.

172
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,450
I can't actually even apply to the exchange to become a market maker so I can quote

173
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,670
both sides of my broker but in the States you have a lot more competition and that's

174
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,390
why you're seeing like Let's like something on Apple. For example,

175
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,750
there's a lot of retail volume as well.

176
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,370
The spreads are so tight So when you guys are Eventually at some point in your careers,

177
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,470
you guys are gonna say like I wish I knew something about liquidity So this is why

178
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,230
we're going through that right now because it's so important,

179
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,950
especially if you find a stock that's you know mispriced Right option that's mispriced,

180
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,970
but the spreads are too wide. Can you work a better order?

181
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,370
Can you work in order to get a better price? Okay,

182
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,110
so usually was on something like Apple Amazon Facebook SPY You don't need to worry

183
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,630
about this stuff,

184
00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,870
but when you get less liquid Right when you're trading a two billion dollar You

185
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,230
know company that only has a couple hundred lots traded a day.

186
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:11,090
This stuff becomes important Right understanding how micro structures working So

187
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,450
do you guys have any questions about that?

188
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:24,960
Okay, nice. So we're gonna continue here so Okay, so what's happening here?

189
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,400
So let's open up.

190
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:37,820
So let's get rid of this video here So what it what's happening here?

191
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,800
well We said the market maker We said the market maker can only have let's say a

192
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:57,200
few slices of a pizza before he starts changing his order Okay so Yeah,

193
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,890
oh That's right. Thanks, man. Thanks for that. Okay. Okay guys,

194
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:18,550
I think pop pop pop it right back in Okay,

195
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,010

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:34,700
It's good It's good Okay,

198
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:43,100
I'll give one more second and then we'll get to it So let's say you come into the

199
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:51,570
market And you want to buy this? 320 call Okay on on NVDA you want to buy this?

200
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,000

201
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:05,910
So here's your call Here's your call on NVDA now How is that what's gonna happen

202
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,810
here? Right? How is the market maker gonna make money?

203
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,720
Now 95% of the time guys, we're gonna be interacting with a market maker Okay,

204
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,280
if you I'd say more than that 90 98% of the time we're gonna be interacting with

205
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,080
a market maker So it's under it's important to understand what's happening here

206
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:28,570
So let's say you want to come in and buy this now the market maker is gonna say

207
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,150
He's gonna have to hold this position if he can't find a seller right especially

208
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,750
in an illiquid market Okay,

209
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,820
pretend we're in a liquid market still He can't go and find a seller He has to yes,

210
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,220
he's gonna sell you this option.

211
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,620
So you're buying it He gets to sell you this option and now he has to hold inventory

212
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,040
Okay, that's that's not what he wants Right.

213
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,340
He wants to market maker wants to remain neutral at all times I know a lot of people

214
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,720
say like all the market makers are out to get me guys market makers are not out

215
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,240
to get You okay.

216
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
Their sole job is to provide liquidity quote the bid quote the ask and collect a

217
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,320
spread every time They love high volatility high volume scenarios, okay,

218
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,300
we're widespread and lots of volume they love it That's their sole job Okay,

219
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,900
they're not taking a view on volatility.

220
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,260
They're not taking a view on direction of the stock Okay,

221
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,600
they're solely trying to quote you and sure they can have alpha strategies in-house

222
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,200
But that that that's beyond the point and besides the point So you want to come

223
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,900
and buy this call?

224
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,880
now what the market maker is gonna do is If he can't find if he can't if he can't

225
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,940
buy it from you for three dollars and sell it to To Neal for three dollars and ten

226
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,460
cents if he can't do that.

227
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,740
He has to take inventory So this is what's gonna happen.

228
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,880
You're he's gonna charge you an extra five cents. Let's say Okay,

229
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,680
and then what he's gonna go and do is he is going to create that exact same call

230
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,480
through a synthetic Okay, so this way is what he's gonna do.

231
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:12,010
He's going to buy the stock Okay So just make sure guys,

232
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:30,720
here's our call Okay He's gonna buy the stock And then he's gonna buy a put Look

233
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,120
at that He just synthetically created our call. It's the exact same trade.

234
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,650
There's the call there's the call you just bought and There's the since that there

235
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,120
is the synthetic Okay,

236
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:54,500
so he now he has a riskless position and he just charged you five cents Extra Okay,

237
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,280
so you are because as a trader we're okay.

238
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,230
Sometimes giving up that five cents to make a trade Right.

239
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:08,390
Our objective is to make is to turn this $30 call into a $60 call Right over let's

240
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,610
say a week or two weeks or three weeks But the market makers job is to do this transaction

241
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,770
with with the person on the other side of the trade thousands of times a day So

242
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,730
all they need is five cents from you and you're you're you are okay with that five

243
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,500
cents So that's what's happening, right?

244
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,980
They're just creating the synthetic Do you guys have any questions about that?

245
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,430
Right, so They're actually selling the call.

246
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,810
So they're taking the opposite trade, but it's the exact same thing.

247
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,700
Yeah Right because you're buying imagine we were selling the call.

248
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,280
How do we say that imagine you were selling the call?

249
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,050
Then they would take on the exact same trade Increase synthetic and charge you five

250
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:05,270
cents for it Okay,

251
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,890
so they're not out to get you All they're doing is creating a market for you and

252
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,810
they're charging you a little bit but they're doing it thousands of times throughout

253
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:19,130
the day Does anyone else understand have questions about that concept?

254
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,740
So if you're looking if we're looking let's say at this call option here So I think

255
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,910
some guy will meet will meet talked about this It's mind-blowing how that guy has

256
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:43,980
like 500,000 Twitter followers Let's take a look at this option right here This

257
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,860
option is two dollars and thirty cents wide So his claim was don't buy this option.

258
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,760
It's too illiquid Okay, don't buy the in the money options.

259
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,270
They're too illiquid But they are just as liquid and in the money option is just

260
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:05,110
as liquid as an out-of-the-money put Because the market maker can synthetically

261
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,080
create that trade Okay,

262
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,780
so just because sometimes you'll see like super wide calls Super wide like let's

263
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,120
say you want to buy in the money call and you see a super wide spread Doesn't mean

264
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,860
it's illiquid the way you want to look at it is look take a look at the puts if

265
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,520
the puts are liquid the calls are gonna Be liquid because the market maker will

266
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:34,220
just synthetically create the put otherwise it's an art Okay And I'll show you I'll

267
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,450
show you what I mean by it's an art Okay, let's buy it.

268
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:47,670
Let's buy this call So we're buying this call for $88 Okay,

269
00:22:48,050 --> 00:23:00,280
so max risk on the trade 88 let's do a one lot max risk on this trade is 8820 bucks

270
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:31,790
Let's go and create this synthetic What

271
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,910
do you mean because this is 99 Delta Because the extrinsic is the same right like

272
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,980
take a look here now. Here's the stock right,

273
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,290
and then we're buying the put and The extrinsic value is the same remember that

274
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:53,190
put call parity says Let's go here That the extrinsic value on the call strike for

275
00:23:53,190 --> 00:24:00,880
let's say for the 270 call it has to be the same for the 270 put They have to be

276
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,420
the same. Otherwise, which I'll show you right now. You'll take a look.

277
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:11,970
So if we did buy this for $88 Okay, if we if we did buy this for 88 bucks,

278
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,830
okay,

279
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:18,870
so this is the ask on the option If you did buy this for $88 then the market maker

280
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:27,470
Could synthetically sell This one and look at this one only eight eight eight thousand

281
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,610
six hundred dollar risk So we're dropping our risk by two thousand dollars.

282
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,790
Now. That is such a widespread Okay,

283
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,990
and what that means is that it allows someone like even me or you to Come and make

284
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,430
an arb here So it becomes competitive Right,

285
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,020
and the market maker is only it only needs five cents So that's why the fair value.

286
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,860
So neil I want to ask you a question What is the fair value of this of our call

287
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,480
option here of the 260 250 call option?

288
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,880
given given this put Given this what is the value of the call option?

289
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,360
Right, it'd be basically yeah,

290
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,460
it'd be eight thousand because let's say the market maker takes five cents You'd

291
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,080
get filled you'd get filled at Eighty seven dollars not eighty eight dollars and

292
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:30,470
twenty cents Okay Are you sure you get it?

293
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,350
What's wrong talk talk me through because if you have questions everyone else has

294
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:51,800
questions Okay.

295
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,260
So let's say you come in you And you buy this So what does that mean for the market

296
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,520
maker?

297
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,000
What does it mean if you buy this What is he holding?

298
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:21,170
Right So this is what he's holding Okay So let's go add this position here riskless

299
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:30,340
trade he captures 125 risk-free Right here.

300
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,730
Here is his here is his position he has from you Okay,

301
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:42,380
he short the in the money call so if he buys If he sent if he sent so he shorted

302
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:51,040
in the money call and if he makes one synthetically then He has this position and

303
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:57,060
this a long call plus a short call of the same strike equals No trade no position

304
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:08,220
on Exactly, right. It's not a risk neutral. It's risk-free.

305
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,960
He he owns exactly Right,

306
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,740
they cancel each other out he gets the extra of for making that for making that

307
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:25,160
commission From for make that transaction perfect And then you also might think

308
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,380
well,

309
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:32,050
this is going to cost them the the dealer margin But the truth is so if he has this

310
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:38,270
position on He's going to basically have no margin for this So you can put on millions

311
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:46,440
of these a day Okay market makers get special treatment when it comes to that They

312
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,300
got amazing financing a whole bunch of really cool stuff that happens that goes

313
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,230
on in those firms Okay,

314
00:27:53,310 --> 00:28:00,060
so he might have a million of these on and then as as the um As the order flow changes,

315
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,300
he starts laying them off. So now this is inventory.

316
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,080
So he has these this position on as his inventory Okay And now let's say let's say

317
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,540
joe from down the street comes in by and says hey, you know what?

318
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,870
I'm looking to i'm looking to uh to buy a call option Or he's looking to sell a

319
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:24,110
call option right then he's going to lay off this call And then he's going to close

320
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:35,870
out this position Okay So he remains he remains neutral At all times he tries to

321
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:41,470
not always he tries to So,

322
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:46,510
let's see what happens here When we are doing so we're gonna we're gonna see how

323
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:52,610
we how how he decides where to put his spreads So,

324
00:28:52,730 --> 00:29:01,570
let's take a look here So here this is a this is a market maker. Okay,

325
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:09,430
most of the time guys this bid and this ask is a market maker Inside is fair value

326
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,610
Okay. So how does he decide that? Well, it's inventory,

327
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:29,330
of course but a lot of the times for especially for liquid stocks let me uh So the

328
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,390
market maker might say okay. Well, so he always quotes involved.

329
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,870
He doesn't quote in price. Okay.

330
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,990
He's always quoting in vol terms Market maker thinks the at the money fair value

331
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,090
volatility is 30 Okay,

332
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,680
this is what he thinks fair value is for those options So what he's going to do

333
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:57,540
is he's going to put an ask I'm, sorry a bid Okay at 25 Okay,

334
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:10,000
and he's going to put an ask at 35 So this is how he's going to start off Now this

335
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,180
is acb. Okay. We're talking acb now.

336
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,820
This is this is the acb so he's going to quote right in here all of a sudden you

337
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:29,820
have The retail community start hitting this They want it So he's now going to start

338
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,580
so now he's starting to get inventory Okay.

339
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,800
So remember one slice of pizza is not the second slice of pizza is never as good

340
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,400
as the first slice So he's not going to charge 35% anymore. He wants more.

341
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,220
Okay.

342
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:54,010
So now this is going to become 36 36% But guess what more retail traders start flooding

343
00:30:54,010 --> 00:31:01,020
the market Okay, and nobody Nobody is buying Nobody is selling at the bid.

344
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,420
Everyone wants to ask So he's going to start moving this up 37 Okay,

345
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,890
this is how the demand supply is working in the market Now eventually there's going

346
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,410
to be so now this is before predicting alpha comes in and starts selling vol Okay,

347
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,800
and taking it off the market makers books. This is before that Okay,

348
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,780
eventually He's going to get so full Okay,

349
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,240
he's gonna get so full these acb puts That now he's going to start skewing his markets

350
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:38,980
So before let's say 30% was fair value remember And so we quoted 5% less and 5%

351
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,700
above Okay.

352
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:52,070
Now let's say fair value Is 35% That's his fair value now after all this retail

353
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,590
came in He doesn't want all this trade on the book, okay,

354
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,830
let's say it's 10 it's 10 Let's say it's a 950 pa terminal hasn't updated yet.

355
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,350
And we and we haven't taken the market makers left on his own in the market What

356
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,310
he's going to do is he's going to skew his book.

357
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:15,130
So fair value is 35% and what he's going to do is he's going to like this 34% for

358
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,220
the bid Okay,

359
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:31,020
he's going to go 40% for the ask Or let's say let's let's call it 42 Okay 42 so

360
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:40,640
now all of a sudden even though his fair value is 35 mid Is now let's say 39 He's

361
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,240
skewing his markets. He's making Sorry guys.

362
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:51,230
Let me make this a little more attractive here he's making This 34% look much more

363
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,370
attractive Than this 42 Okay.

364
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:07,370
So when we see wide markets guys Mid Does not mean anything When we see volatile

365
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:14,440
markets with ACB mid means nothing right when there's a lot of volume going on in

366
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,660
a stock but relative to what it usually is so not like I'm talking spy where there's

367
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:24,420
usually you know, it's very competitive and The volume is usually high.

368
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,720
I'm talking when you know,

369
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,320
ACB volume volume goes from 20 million to 200 million dollars 200 million volume,

370
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:43,900
okay Mid Markets get wide mid does not mean fair value anymore Okay so If we're

371
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:51,230
selling If we're coming in and selling The options to the market maker Sorry,

372
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,410
if we're if we're coming in and selling options and we're taking off So he has inventory

373
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:13,870
and now now pa comes in Let me erase this Okay,

374
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,040
let's go Let's go green Okay, so market maker, okay,

375
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:28,450
he's got inventory let's say he owns a thousand ACB calls Predicting alpha comes

376
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,470
in and says, you know what?

377
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,640
We'll take we'll take a hundred of those from you Okay,

378
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,820
he is gonna be more than generous to lay those off to us Okay,

379
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,390
we actually might get so his fair value was 30 35 percent Right,

380
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:52,780
we might actually get the mid here But at 39 right mid was 39 but a buyer won't

381
00:34:52,780 --> 00:35:00,720
get the mid Okay, he's skewing his books Do you guys have questions about that?

382
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,900
Dude, do you see how are you guys starting to see how this works,

383
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,280
especially with earning season, right?

384
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:17,140
so RBC will have a desk that tries to Take take the blow when people are coming

385
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,420
in buying options Right,

386
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,640
the demand for options is way higher than the supply for options before an earnings

387
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,980
event So market makers are getting paid now,

388
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,900
right and dealers are getting paid to come in and and take on the blow and take

389
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,940
on the load Right.

390
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,820
So that's why a lot of the time guys like right like right but like around like

391
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,960
350 355 We get like these amazing fills right near the ask right,

392
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,700
not all the time,

393
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,400
but on something like Microsoft or Facebook like those stocks were just like it

394
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,140
tracks so much buyers We always get those nice fills but on something that's less

395
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,020
liquid and there's not a lot of buyers, right?

396
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,410
Like like you've seen us struggling with some of those less liquid names Okay.

397
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:07,310
So this is how this is how this is all working At a very high level right at a low

398
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,370
level, of course, it gets way more complex, but a very high level.

399
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:18,600
This is how The markets working with us and interacting with us Do you guys have

400
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,300
questions about that?

401
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,880
No questions. Well, I must I must have put all you guys to sleep you know,

402
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,800
I thought like For me at least like when I first learned about like how how markets

403
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,620
work. I thought like wow,

404
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,010
you know This is so this is so cool you know get to kind of like See how you fit

405
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,780
into the market right and who you're really interacting with So you sure you guys

406
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:59,170
don't have any questions there? Yeah okay, no, no,

407
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:07,290
so Just because it's a liquid doesn't mean you get the mid It's It's right.

408
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,210
So it's it Depending on where the where the market is skewing.

409
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,890
So in a liquid market, you don't have a lot of buyers In fact,

410
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,450
you have no buyers So when you're selling you're probably get way worse than mid

411
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,750
Because you like the market maker is literally gonna take on inventory for you But

412
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,790
if you look at right,

413
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,930
it's all about the demand supply so if you look at a stock where there's a lot of

414
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,900
volume and a lot of the volume is by orders Then you might get better than the mid

415
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,350
Right, or you might get the mid and the mid is not fair value Right.

416
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:51,120
Remember how that we said the market makers skews the book to make right so So we

417
00:37:51,120 --> 00:38:05,390
have 35 and 43 okay, but the market maker says Fair-value is 36% Okay,

418
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:15,840
he's making the bid look so attractive So we come in mid is 39 we We might get this

419
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,190
But a lot of time we actually will get this Because he's more than happy to lay

420
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,430
off.

421
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:31,000
He has so much inventory is more than happy to lay off some inventory to us Okay,

422
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,980
and this is gonna happen.

423
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:39,060
This is this is really prevalent in Low market cap stocks that have like insane

424
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:45,460
amount of volume a CB One of some of the other ones that we traded guys like VT

425
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,580
IQ SPC all those names Where all of a sudden you get a whole bunch of order flow

426
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,640
and like, you know,

427
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,350
the market makers are scrambling You're gonna have them skew in there.

428
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,370
You're gonna have volatility go crazy,

429
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:03,520
which is why we saw ACB volatility 500% Right,

430
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,980
it's not because the market maker said hey,

431
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,200
you know what fair value is 500% It clearly wasn't like the market only moved a

432
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,500
hundred and twenty percent So clearly there's no way that the market maker is that

433
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,800
wrong?

434
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,060
But what happened was it was just so much order flow coming into the market That

435
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,700
the market maker is taking on inventory.

436
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,260
There's only one way flow happening It's only buyers coming in like who in heaven's

437
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:34,260
name is selling options on ACB after a 30% move Who is selling that on a low market

438
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,960
cap stock It's too small for big for big funds to trade it.

439
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,320
They probably can't even trade it.

440
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:46,200
It's like against their risk limits So you've no you've all demand no supply and

441
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,660
that's why Implied volatility was so high and so we're coming in there We're gonna

442
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,020
get we're gonna get the mid bids were bitten ask was wide But I remember coming

443
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,360
in there and like instant fill at the mid right and who knows Fair value on the

444
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,440
market makers book was probably, you know,

445
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,200
ten points lower and his forecast of volatility was probably a hundred points lower

446
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,540
Okay, but he's not trying to take him. He's not true.

447
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,840
He makes money neutral He's not trying to take a view on volatility.

448
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,240
He sometimes does right?

449
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:32,320
Especially if he's holding inventory But it's not all the time Okay Yeah Any more

450
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,340
questions about that?

451
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,960
We're gonna end it there we'll leave we'll open it up for if you guys don't talk

452
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,600
about anything else But 841 I will leave it there. I'm pretty sure that's uh,

453
00:40:46,340 --> 00:41:03,780
We just double check my notes here Yeah Yeah so

454
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:13,520
One of our goals Maddie is We want you to understand how things work Okay,

455
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,540
because markets change strategies change,

456
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,000
but if you can get a fundamental understanding of what's going on You're gonna be

457
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,700
more confident and you'll be able to change your change your strategy quickly,

458
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,060
so The goal of this Maddie is to give you more confidence when you're trading be

459
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,680
like, okay I understand why I'm playing volatility is high It's because well,

460
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,400
you know,

461
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,900
there's a lot of order flow coming in and the market makers are probably Taking

462
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,760
on too much inventory.

463
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,360
So it makes sense for me to come in and sell and sell the options Another thing

464
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,260
you can do is when you're trading in liquid stocks, right?

465
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,960
You're not just gonna go in and try to get filled up the mid Well,

466
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,180
you're gonna try to try to find. Okay. Well, where is fair value here? Right.

467
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,200
I know on interactive brokers. For example,

468
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,880
they have something called the mark Let me see if I can pull that up here quickly

469
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,270
Okay, so you guys see this here mark? Yes, this is not Yeah,

470
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:17,590
can you guys see my interactive brokers platform here? Okay, so See this mark.

471
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:23,050
So this is so what interactive brokers does is they fit a spline? Okay,

472
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,350
so they try to find well What is the fair value of?

473
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,410
These options if we were if we were to say they were all the same volatility or

474
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,450
near the same volatility Okay, how can we fit the best fit spline?

475
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:46,400
and so It's 367 is there a fair value so if I come in here and I buy for 570 That's

476
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,280
ridiculous. I put an order for 570. That's ridiculous, right?

477
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,760
Or let's say mid here is $4 and 30 cents if I come in there and place more for $4

478
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,960
30 cents I'll probably get scooped up Right if there's some hidden liquidity in

479
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,130
here so One of the reasons I'm you know,

480
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,810
I'm doing this as well as so you guys can say well Maybe if I'm trading a liquid

481
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:11,710
stock don't just go for the mid Okay, try to see you try to see okay. Well,

482
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,270
where is where should this liquidity be?

483
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:18,660
okay,

484
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,130
and obviously there's there's techniques to do that like but it requires a little

485
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,810
bit of programming right you got to be able to take the implied volatility of Forecast

486
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,390
or something?

487
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:37,930
so that does take some programming but You know other than that you have to just

488
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,030
try to look at it and say well, where is where's fair value?

489
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,450
Right if you guys want to pick up programming,

490
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,570
I know Maddie starting to learn it, which is awesome You gotta be like,

491
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,250
okay Well, where do I think fair value is here?

492
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,610
Is it at mid or is it probably a lot less right if the spreads are wide?

493
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:58,760
Maybe I can start a lot a lot less than mid Okay Did that answer your question Maddie?

494
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,990
Awesome. Awesome Yeah, Maddie. I like I hope you know,

495
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,870
this also gives you a lot of a lot more confidence understanding. Well,

496
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,910
why is implied volatility high?

497
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:28,220
Okay Yeah Maddie

498
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,920
did you see the the where I was showing the video of me trying to pull down the

499
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,360
market maker?

500
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:45,630
Okay Yeah Yeah Right. Yeah super quick. So he's 570,

501
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,370
but he's actually willing to go less So I'm gonna go 565 drop him down drop him

502
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,170
down drop him down.

503
00:44:51,450 --> 00:45:04,560
Then I'm gonna hit him Okay Yeah Just gonna hammer him exactly because We know that

504
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,060
his fair value is probably a lot less.

505
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,900
There's no way he's this So this tells you this tells us that he's not confident,

506
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,820
right?

507
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,570
He's not confident with his forecast or just liquidity is so bad so he's quoting

508
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:22,420
so wide and So we're gonna bring him down because we think that he's willing to

509
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,360
come down and we're gonna keep bringing him down until He stops coming down Well,

510
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:34,060
I will clear him up Yeah,

511
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,520
I'm telling you Maddie this is gonna come in super handy when you start trading

512
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,620
super illiquid stocks If you start trading them,

513
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:55,480
yeah now Yeah Okay. So Kel Kelly got question here,

514
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:00,780
so If you identified that it's it's illiquid Why enter into the trade in the first

515
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:06,900
place since there's probability that it'll be difficult to exit the trade 100% 100

516
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:13,070
% so It's not just let's get in and then we're done right it's we can get in and

517
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,200
then Well, we now we got to work our way out Right.

518
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,540
So we're getting dinged on both sides.

519
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,900
Now the reason why we would ever be trading in a liquid market is because There's

520
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,790
probably gonna be more mispricing Right think like think about like this if you

521
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:39,470
if there's no competition in that space Right think about like the super The micro

522
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:45,840
cap stocks Those earnings events are probably not gonna be priced efficiently right,

523
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,140
so you could come in and take a directional view because the stock the price of

524
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,920
the stock is not Reflecting something in the market, right?

525
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,060
If everyone's looking at all the analysts are looking at the stock then it's gonna

526
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:00,380
be priced a lot more efficiently I think about real estate. For example,

527
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,820
the real estate market is so much less efficient In the stock market because there's

528
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:12,120
there's no liquidity there So though that's the only reason why are we going into

529
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:20,520
a liquid illiquid names and that's to be finding opportunities Finding larger mispricings

530
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,720
that are gonna cover your transaction costs Right. I mean,

531
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,260
how many how often are you gonna find a mispricing in Apple?

532
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,600
Probably probably never well,

533
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,800
I wouldn't say never but probably not that often But if you want to the smaller

534
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:43,830
cap names all of a sudden You might find some opportunities here and there I'll

535
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:51,330
go answer your question Right, right.

536
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:59,060
The the more the more liquidity you have the more efficient it should be Perfect.

537
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:11,230
No problem. No problem Hey, bud Thanks.

538
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:22,620
I did the exact same thing it So it was six like it was it was it was a liquid market.

539
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,560
Remember it was like I can't remember how wide the spread was It's pretty wide Mm

540
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:27,720
-hmm.

541
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,920
So what I did was so you wanted to buy let's say it was 555 You wanted to buy here?

542
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,640
Okay, and the market maker was quoting you 655. So what I did was I said,

543
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:45,760
well Let me come down five cents and I came down five cents and he jumped me Right

544
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:57,110
came down another five cents. He jumped me and then you got dinged Right,

545
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,120
right. So remember it's a it's that pizza slice So he ate a peach.

546
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,260
I said I'm done Right,

547
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,760
maybe maybe maybe it was a small market maker at that point. No,

548
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,620
it doesn't always happen You know,

549
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,690
you can't do this on Citadel but that was an illiquid stock right,

550
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,750
and there's probably not the greatest market maker on the other side of the trade

551
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,330
and Remember, he's not losing money from that.

552
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:24,610
Like I guess in the sense that He's he's still he's still only gonna go down to

553
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,530
where he thinks he can still make money. So keep that in mind Okay,

554
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:33,620
so in this case scenario When it was six dollars,

555
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,180
he's making a lot of money But when we're down to 570,

556
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,620
he still thinks he can make money there Okay,

557
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,600
he's not he's not going into a losing trade for us,

558
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,280
obviously He's saying I can still make money at 570,

559
00:49:49,440 --> 00:50:03,260
but we're just bringing him down a little bit Okay That's good.

560
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,340
No Do it like does that make more sense now?

561
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:16,340
What happened there and during that trade? Okay Okay, so we'll leave it.

562
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,440
We'll leave it at that guys So that was a little bit about market making some microstructure

563
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,920
and Yeah,

564
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,340
I hope you guys found that pretty pretty insightful I mean when I first found out

565
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,560
about how the hell the hell these market makers are working and how I interact with

566
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,880
them I thought it was like so eye-opening for me.

567
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,920
So I hope I did a good job explaining it to you guys A little bit eye-opening for

568
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:45,940
you as well Okay, perfect If you guys don't have any more questions,

569
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,320
we'll leave it at that This was being recorded and I'll put it up and I got yesterday's

570
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,280
recording that I'm gonna throw in right after this live It's all done Or two days

571
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,820
ago recording.

572
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:03,930
So I'll throw that up right now Yeah Right couple bucks couple bucks.

573
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:17,830
We got in there But yeah, okay guys So we'll we'll leave it at that Okay,

574
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:23,530
perfect. Cheers guys. Yeah, no problem guys. Yeah. Awesome. Awesome Oh guys,

575
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,030
just so you know,

576
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,130
the shit show is not gonna be opened right now because I sent Sean a message I can't

577
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:28,730
get in touch with him.

578
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:35,240
I Don't know how to how to open it up So we're going to we're gonna have to deal

579
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,940
without it today But what we will we'll be back at it tomorrow unless it's already

580
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,740
opened. I see someone posted in there. Ha Look at that. No,

581
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:53,280
you hacked the system, buddy That was it. Hey, don't kill me. Okay All right,
