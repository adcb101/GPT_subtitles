00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Hey guys, and welcome back to another silver video in today's lesson.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,640
We're going to be talking about my personal favorite topic Which is relative value

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,400
now,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,400
this is how I want you guys to think about this topic Imagine you own a $5,000 TV.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,420
You look on Kijiji and it's being priced for $5,000 You then also go to another

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,860
website.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,400
Let's call it Amazon and you see a very similar TV being priced for $3,000.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,880
Well, what would you do?

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:37,480
You would sell your $5,000 TV and buy that $3,000 TV and this is how we're gonna

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,730
be thinking about relative value trading or imagine we're looking at Pepsi Pep and

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,710
this is how the stock moves.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,410
Well, if I asked you, what do you think Coca-Cola would look like?

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:08,570
I bet you would say something like this Because Pepsi and Coca-Cola have the same

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,810
industry same market cap same underlying fundamentals They're very similar companies.

15
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,590
So you would expect them to move very similar with each other now imagine a scenario

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:31,230
where we wake up one morning and Coca-Cola trades like this but Pepsi Gets smoked

17
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,570
and is trading down here.

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:41,070
Well all of a sudden we have a relative value situation we can sell Coca-Cola and

19
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:48,610
Buy Pepsi and and hope for this spread to collapse in the future what we would be

20
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:56,500
betting on is for maybe Pepsi to come up here and Coca-Cola to move down here in

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:03,260
which case we would make money on our long from buying Pepsi and we would Also make

22
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,400
money from our short on selling Coca-Cola now,

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,900
it doesn't have to be exactly like this.

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,340
We could also see something Like this Coca-Cola shoots up,

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:22,390
but Pepsi Increases even more so even though we lose on our short position We make

26
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:30,430
more money on our long position on Pepsi and this is relative value Given one asset

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,490
What should this asset be priced at?

28
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,910
So this is what a lot of my trades are actually made of where we're trying to look

29
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,290
for relationships between Certain underlines this is something that is used in the

30
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,710
professional space all the time In fact,

31
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,750
almost all the big option traders use something similar to relative value.

32
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,100
They are Buying one asset and hedging with another asset a lot of professional traders

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,020
don't like to have Delta to the market meaning they don't like to lose money when

34
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,600
the market goes down and make money when the market goes up They want to be neutral

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,760
So these relative value trades can help with that We don't care what happens to

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,600
the S&P 500 the next day the S&P 500 you go up here down here sideways Wherever

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,280
as long as this spread closes,

38
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,920
we're gonna make money So these spread trades are not one-offs They actually happen

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,170
all the time if we were to let's say zoom in on this part right over here We might

40
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,140
see the spread So, let's say this is coca-cola and this is Pepsi,

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:51,220
right we actually might see this Where we are trading this spread when we get these

42
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,340
gaps in the market we can start buying the one that's moving away and selling the

43
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,470
one that's Remaining high and waiting for this spread To come back together now,

44
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,390
we can also do this in the volatility market Which is where we are trading right

45
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,950
now and we actually find much more inefficiencies and why is that? Well,

46
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,190
anyone compares trade coca-cola and Pepsi.

47
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,950
It's very liquid All the big fund managers are doing long short equity,

48
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:25,290
but not everyone is doing long short relative value in the volatility space So,

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,830
let's see what that looks like We would imagine that Pepsi and coca-cola have the

50
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,590
same amount of volatility And if Pepsi is moving 5% a day coca-cola is probably

51
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,970
moving very similar to 5% a day So we would expect that the volatility would be

52
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,370
the same for both the implied volatility for coca-cola so say IV for coke IV KO

53
00:04:47,370 --> 00:05:02,500
is equal to 20% and Imagine we saw Pepsi implied volatility Was 60% Well,

54
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,720
there's got to be a mispricing here Pepsi should be moving very similar to coca

55
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,820
-cola. Why on earth are they?

56
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,480
expecting a 20% move or 20% volatility and Pepsi is expecting 60% volatility.

57
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,260
It doesn't make sense that the same underlying factors So what we could do here

58
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:32,110
is a pairs volatility trade We could buy volatility on KO on coca-cola Right,

59
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,740
and we would do this by buying a straddle and we would sell volatility on Pepsi

60
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,820
And we would do that by selling a straddle and the way we would think about it is

61
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,320
if anything were to happen in the market Coca-cola would pay out a lot more than

62
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,020
what we lose on Pepsi And this is what we call volatility arbitrage or stat arm

63
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,360
in the volatility space It's a very reliable way to make money one downside of this

64
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,940
is that To sell a straddle naked It's gonna cost quite a bit of margin So that is

65
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,560
why a lot of the bigger players love this trade because they get access to better

66
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,320
margin, right?

67
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,000
They get access to portfolio margin and you know retail trader might not be able

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,740
to get access to that So that's one reason why this kind of strategy is huge in

69
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,500
the professional space So the way you can make money and a lot of time the way I

70
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,460
look at trading is I like to use one What I mean is if Pepsi is trading at 60 and

71
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:42,990
coke is trading at 20 maybe fair value around here is 40% that is the fair value

72
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,630
for these underlyings right,

73
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,230
we would imagine that the implied volatility of Pepsi at 60% is still pretty efficient

74
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,710
and We would also say that while the coca-cola trade is also probably pretty efficient.

75
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,020
These are both pretty liquid names So what we would do is we would buy the leg let's

76
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:12,750
say in this case coca-cola and Just trade one of the legs so we would remove the

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:21,710
short straddle and Just buy the long straddle and hope that the volatility is somewhere

78
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,720
in between these So this is what I like to do a lot of the times Another way we

79
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,280
can do this is imagine we have two equities SPY and some illiquid ETF Maybe like

80
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,680
a small cap ETF and we see that the implied volatilities are 20% and 60% Well right

81
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,540
away we would assume that this Option chain is gonna be a lot more liquid.

82
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,120
It's gonna be a lot more efficient SPY is a lot more efficient.

83
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,980
There's more eyes looking at it. There's more liquidity.

84
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,580
There's more hedge fund managers There's more smart people trying to trade SPY and

85
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,260
if SPY is assuming 20% implied volatility and this small cap ETF is assuming 60

86
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,280
% implied volatility And it's very similar to SPY Well,

87
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,640
what we can do then is we can say well, let's sell an iron condor here,

88
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:17,700
let's sell volatility on this and Hope that This number is correct that the SPY

89
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,000
is the efficient market and that this is the inefficient market and so we can trade

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,100
one leg here and we would just for example sell an iron condor and realize this

91
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,240
20% volatility for This small cap ETF.

92
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,560
So this is a lot of what I do I trade one leg usually and I look for inefficiencies

93
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,500
like this in the market So now that we're all excited about relative value Let me

94
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,800
give you an example of a trade that I did and posted with a group and actually some

95
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,800
group members took last Week that was extremely profitable now that we're all excited

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,220
about relative value trades Let's actually look at an example that I took last week

97
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,640
with the group that made amazing profits I think we made 25% on this trade in just

98
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,440
two days Now a lot of you guys might be like 25% in two days whoop-dee-doo But that's

99
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,640
25% that we made off of inefficiency in the market.

100
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,400
That's real money This it wasn't a lottery ticket that we decided to you know to

101
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,860
go to church afterwards and start praying This was something that we saw in the

102
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,060
market We took advantage of and we had a high probability of actually winning and

103
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:34,490
making money So let's dig down and see what exactly we took so IWM was trading at

104
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:42,340
60% Implied volatility the options market thought that IWM was going to move about

105
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:49,080
4% on average per day I also looked at SPY Which is a very similar ETF.

106
00:09:49,660 --> 00:10:02,940
It is the biggest 500 companies and the implied volatility was 29% Meaning only

107
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,440
about a 1.8% move on a daily basis now,

108
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,800
this is a huge discrepancy Now think about it guys.

109
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,680
These ETFs are very similar. They move the same.

110
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,200
You can look at it historically They move the same or very close to each other.

111
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:29,040
This doesn't make sense So what I decided to do was sell an iron condor on IWM.

112
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:44,880
I sold the 127 141 141 151 iron condor for a total of $7 what

113
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:54,320
I was betting on was this number 60% being way too large and the S&P 500 is the

114
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,420
most liquid ETF in the world I was assuming that this number was a lot more efficient

115
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,600
than this number So my alpha leg or the leg that would make me money would be this

116
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,170
one So I decided to sell 127 141 151. Oh,

117
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:25,250
it's not sorry 155 My apologies iron condor for $7 now the next day IWM went from

118
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:36,480
141 to 143 a $2 move right away This started dropping because the move was not as

119
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,820
large as the market was expecting So we took a little bit of profits on day one

120
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:51,640
on day two the stock dropped back down to 141 and which we were able to exit this

121
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:59,700
position at $5 So we sold it for seven and we bought it back for five within two

122
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:10,740
days Meaning we captured a profit of two dollars So it turned out that this market

123
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:18,060
the S&P 500 was more efficient than IWM and that this number 60% implied volatility

124
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,750
was way too high It should have been at something like let's say 45% and by doing

125
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,410
so we did a fantastic job of making Some money.

126
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,270
So I hope this real-world example is getting you guys thinking about how you can
