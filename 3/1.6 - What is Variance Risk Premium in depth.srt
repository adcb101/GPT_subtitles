1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,890
Oh, man. Okay. Recording. Thanks, Eric. Dude. Brilliant.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,450
Sean already killed me. Okay. Wow. We got some cool answers here. Okay.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,570
So in percentage returns. So blessing is saying 8%. Okay. So daily,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,710
daily blessing. Marcos is saying 0.4%. So Marcos.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,130
Okay. So 0.4%. Okay. So okay. Steve's saying 0.007%. Koaw is saying 0.02%.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,360
Okay. Okay. Ains is saying 0.3%. 0.03%. Let's see if someone...

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,000
Trent's saying 0.006%. Okay. Who had the lowest? Here it is. Trent.

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,060
There it is. Trent's saying 0.003%. Let's take a look, guys.

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:01,160
Let's take a look. 0.0002%. So what does this mean? What does this mean?

10
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,450
It means every single day. So while you're holding equity,

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,640
let's say I go buy the S&P 500 today. Every single day,

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:22,460
I am making this much money. Okay. For 0.0002%. So if I have, let's say,

13
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:29,120
$100,000 invested. Okay. I have $100,000 invested.

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,960
Then every single day, I'm making about $286.

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,580
Was that $100,000 or was that a million? That was a million.

16
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,040
If I have a million dollars invested, okay, every single day,

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,960
I make on average $286.

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Now,

19
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,130
here's a really tough one, guys.

20
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,710
What do you think the most frequent return is going to be?

21
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,310
Like what is the median return? What is... So if we hold equity here, okay,

22
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,590
we're holding equity every single day. On average, we're going to make $286.

23
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,930
Some days, we're going to make $1,000. Some days, we're going to lose $8,000,

24
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,770
okay, if we have a million dollars of equity.

25
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,700
What do you think the most frequent return is going to be?

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,300
What do you guys think? Higher or lower than $286 a day?

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
What do you guys think here?

28
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,500
Sorry, guys. I got to move the chat over here. I can't see you guys. Hi. Hi.

29
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:58,270
Hi. Who's saying lower? Blessing. Blessing. It's higher.

30
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,250
It's going to be higher.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,850
Blessing is always spot on with these. She must have had a busy day today.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,860
Okay. So if we take the median, right, we take the median of the RETs,

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:26,500
of the RETs, okay, it's going to be 0.0006.

34
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,900
So almost three times more than the mean. Now, why is that the case? Why...

35
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,350
So if we took the median, okay, so we multiply that by a million, okay,

36
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:51,100
so 50%... So the median tells us the 50% mark, right? So 50% of the days,

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,120
we're going to be more than $634. And 50% of the days,

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,990
we're going to be less than $634. Okay. Now, why would that be the case?

39
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,320
Thank you. Thanks, Steven. Okay. It's because there's a big left tail,

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,060
meaning that stonks can go down fast, right? So because of that,

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,420
because the stocks go down fast, right,

42
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,970
you're going to get paid a risk premium, right? Because stocks can go down 50%,

43
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,270
you are going to get paid a risk premium. Otherwise,

44
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,660
why in God's name would you hold the stock, right?

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,550
Why would you buy stock if when you lose your job, equities go down as well?

46
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,210
You lose your portfolio, right? Think about this. When you lose your job,

47
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,490
the market's usually going down.

48
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,590
So why in God's name would I basically buy something where I'm going to lose my

49
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:57,530
job? And when I lose my job, I'm also going to lose my money and my portfolio.

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,270
It doesn't make sense. So, you know,

51
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,590
you're going to get paid an equity risk premium.

52
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,400
And if we do this, guys, check this out, okay? If we go, you know,

53
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,700
if we sum up the average,

54
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:28,560
if we cumulatively sum up those returns, right? Those returns that we just had,

55
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,680
we plot them.

56
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,940
Yeah, Tico, you see, I think Sean needs a new computer, man.

57
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,640
I think Sean needs the new computer, Tico.

58
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,620
Oh, you know what, Tico? I think this is the answer.

59
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,970
And the reason why I'm talking to Tico there is just because we had a little call.

60
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,210
So there you go, right? When we add up those returns,

61
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,970
we find that we get the equity price or the S&P 500.

62
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,180
So everyone understands equity risk premium because we're going to jump over to

63
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,860
variance risk premium.

64
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Yeah, exactly. Right, Marcos?

65
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,840
So you add up all those little small days at the end of the year,

66
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,780
and you're going to get, right? Check this out. 0.00, what was it? 2.8, Marcos?

67
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,660
2.8 to the power of, or sorry,

68
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,500
okay? This is going to be very cool for you guys.

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:49,370
To the power of 252 trading days in the year, check this out, 0.0738, right?

70
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,590
There's that equity risk premium right there, right?

71
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,350
This is what you're going to get paid on at the end of the day.

72
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,650
If let's say your risk premium, let's say you made 0.002, okay?

73
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,400
Let's see how rich you would be at the end of the year. Steve B,

74
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,320
you ready for this one? Here we go. You double your money, right?

75
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:19,000
So just making a 20th of a percent every day would give you a huge return at the

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,180
end of the year, okay? So obviously, if we can find risk premiums, right?

77
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,170
That give us a little bit more money, but we're going to make quite a bit.

78
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,770
We're going to make quite a bit of money.

79
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,320
So we're going back to what Blessing was saying there.

80
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,620
It means you make a lot of money.

81
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,700
So let us get symbols, okay? We're going to do something very cool here.

82
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,100
Okay, guys, we're going to get what our buddy Justin was talking about.

83
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,560
We're going to get symbols. We're going to get the VIX. Okay,

84
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,160
now can someone tell me what the VIX is in brief? Okay,

85
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,660
the VIX is actually a very complex product,

86
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,810
but if someone could just give me a super quick idea of what the hell the VIX is

87
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,700
while I get everything else set up here.

88
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,450
What I'm just doing right now, guys, is I'm just calculating the volatility,

89
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,220
the realized volatility for the S&P 500.

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,320
Just bear with me, guys, for one quick second here. I promise you,

91
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,660
this is going to be very exciting. It's going to be very exciting.

92
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:02,130
So let, you know, oops. Let's take a look here. So what do we got here? So,

93
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,460
well, okay. So we got, maybe we talk, okay. Yeah, thanks. Cool. Okay,

94
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,280
so Marco's saying it's the volatility index. Great.

95
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,060
Renato's saying it's the vol of the S&P, okay.

96
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,840
Measures without any options of the S&P. Someone's been doing some studying.

97
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,930
Good work, Justin. Blessing, I haven't looked at vol Q and VXN.

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,700
Maybe I have looked at VXN actually, Blessing.

99
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,680
I don't think I've looked at vol Q. That's the volatility of the Qs, right?

100
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,260
Maybe not.

101
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,860
And co-op, send me a link to the singer Yang Zeng. Okay,

102
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,440
so what the volatility index is, is it's basically the implied volatility,

103
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,140
okay, of selling, or no, not selling, my apologies.

104
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,900
It's the implied volatility of the options on the S&P 500, the 30-day options,

105
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,770
about the 90 moneyness. And moneyness means if the stock's trading at 100,

106
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,600
it's the 90 strike, okay. So it's just below the at the money options,

107
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,620
the implied volatility. And so what it really is, is the market's,

108
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,540
it's the market's prediction of what the volatility in the future is going to be,

109
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,790
okay.

110
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,830
The market's prediction of what the volatility in the future is going to be.

111
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,700
That's what the VIX index is for the 30-day options, okay.

112
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,900
So for the 30-day options. Now, what I just did here was,

113
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
what I just did here, guys, was I calculated. So here's the VIX.

114
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,290
So let me give you an example, okay. The VIX closed at 10%, okay.

115
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,630
The VIX closed at 10%,

116
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,940
meaning that the market thought that there was going to be 10% volatility going

117
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,160
forward. And what, you know, at that time, at that time being,

118
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,360
the market was moving about 7%.

119
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,240
Now, we want to look at the variance risk premium, okay.

120
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,500
So given this data that I just showed you guys, what do you,

121
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,600
can someone explain to me what the variance risk premium is?

122
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,480
Just given this data that I'm just showing you right here,

123
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,900
what do you guys think it's going to be?

124
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,280
So this SPY vol, this is the volatility, okay. This is the realized volatility,

125
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,750
what's actually happened. And this is the implied volatility, okay. So what's,

126
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,310
like, what do you think what we're going to do here? Perfect. Thank you.

127
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,620
Thank you, Eric. It's going to be the difference. Okay. Okay, Mr. Smittypants,

128
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:53,040
saying delta, delta between. Okay. So, but what we need to do, though,

129
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,290
is we need to, well, we need to lag the volatility.

130
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,230
We need to lag the volatility, right? Because think about it like this, guys.

131
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,730
What we're looking at right now,

132
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,090
what we're looking at is this.

133
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,770
So this is time.

134
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,000
And we have the volatility that's looked like this,

135
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,400
and we have the implied volatility that maybe looked like this, right?

136
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,370
But what this VIX right here, okay, let's say this is the VIX. And sorry, guys,

137
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,550
you know, I'm really bad at sometimes, when I get a little technical,

138
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,430
I kind of, I kind of get bad at explaining, but this is the VIX,

139
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,850
and the VIX is saying, well,

140
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,560
what is the volatility going to be in the next 30 days? Okay.

141
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,640
What is the volatility going to be in the future?

142
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,110
And so we can't compare it to the realized volatility here to get the equity risk

143
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,740
premium or the variance risk premium. What we need to do is we need to say,

144
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:05,250
okay, what's actually happened, right? And we need to compare this with this.

145
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,970
We need to compare what the market implied versus what actually happened.

146
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,930
So what we're going to do is, is we're going to shift this back.

147
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,700
We're going to shift this back. So that's what I'm going to do right now. Okay.

148
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,760
A little bit of data science there for everyone, right?

149
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,300
Everyone in this group loves data science.

150
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,160
Okay. So we're going to call this one DF. We're going to call it actual,

151
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,620
actual vol equals two.

152
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,740
And okay, we're going to blank it back one month. Cool.

153
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,750
So now let's take a look, guys. We got the data. Everything's looking good.

154
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,530
So let's take a look super quick and we're going to plot it.

155
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,950
So you see that guys, look at this. We took this number.

156
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,770
That's 21 days in the future. Okay. 0.007. And we moved it all the way up here.

157
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,970
So we can say, okay, well, on 2007, January 3rd, the VIX was saying,

158
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,210
the market's going to have 12% volatility in the future. And so we said, okay,

159
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,080
well, what actually happened in the future? And let's bring it back to today.

160
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay. And now we're comparing apples to apples. All right.

161
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,830
So everyone's good with that. Tell me if everyone's good with that.

162
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,730
I need to know.

163
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,970
I need to know.

164
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,160
What do you guys think? Are we getting smarter or am I just getting crazy?

165
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,180
Am I going a little crazy over here? What is going on?

166
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,260
Eric, that's funny, man. If you saw me full speed,

167
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,620
I don't know if you're being a little sarcastic there.

168
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,840
If you saw me full speed, dude.

169
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,580
Okay. Marcos saying yes, but market conditions change every year. You bet.

170
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,220
You bet. So I'm going to plot this Marcos and we're going to take a look.

171
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,480
We're going to take a look because Marcos, you are 100% right.

172
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,470
Can't come up with a decision looking at the past.

173
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,410
Blessing saying, so VRP is VIX minus RV.

174
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,610
Blessing took the words right out of my mouth.

175
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,220
Took the words right out of my mouth.

176
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,930
Can't come up with a decision looking at the past. Absolutely.

177
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,510
Let us create the spread. Here we go, guys. DF, VRP.

178
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:56,360
We're creating the variance risk premium equals the VIX divided by actual vol.

179
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,710
Okay.

180
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,710
So before we actually do that, I'm going to plot the two so we can take a look.

181
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,240
Okay.

182
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,620
Let me just make sure we're good here. Sorry, guys. Bear with me. Bear with me.

183
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,240
Excellent. Here we go, guys. Ready?

184
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,210
So what do we notice? Come on. Who's the data scientist here?

185
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,050
What do we notice, guys?

186
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,740
What do we notice?

187
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,930
Who is the data scientist in the group?

188
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,200
So Eric, I'm definitely going to plot the difference in a second,

189
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,130
but as a good data scientist, we need to visualize the data.

190
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,800
We need to really take a look at it, right?

191
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,780
We'll take a look at how these things are looking. Just, you know,

192
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,320
just quick notices, and then we're going to plot the data.

193
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,720
We're going to plot the real data. Mean reverting?

194
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,940
Koa is saying mean reverting.

195
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,140
Koa, really? It definitely is mean reverting. Is that the...

196
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,980
What else do you notice there?

197
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,960
VIX is lower more times than high.

198
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,470
Oh, thanks, Stephen. I was going to say, where's Stephen's post here?

199
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:59,150
So the VIX, which is the black line, usually overstates realized volatility.

200
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,700
It usually overstates realized volatility. Now, what does this mean?

201
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,420
Before we plot the spread between them, what does this mean? Well,

202
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,480
let's take a look. Let's go to an option calculator,

203
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,970
and this is in the terminal.

204
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,610
So what does this mean, guys? Well,

205
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:30,530
imagine we're looking at an option on a stock, Tesla, that's trading at $800,

206
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,440
and we are looking at the $800 straddle, and the days to expiration are 20,

207
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,690
or 30. Sorry, we're looking at the one-month options,

208
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:51,250
and the implied volatility is 30. The implied volatility is 30. Well,

209
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,830
the option today, or the straddle today,

210
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,330
is going to be worth $27.40 for the call and $27.40 for the put.

211
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,810
So we're at $55.

212
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:12,740
So the straddle is going to be worth $55. But if the stonk realizes 20 vol,

213
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,900
right, if it realizes 20 vol, well, that option today is only worth $36.

214
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,830
So on average, if this is continuous, right, on average,

215
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:35,200
we're going to sell these options for $55 and basically realize only $36 worth.

216
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,620
So we're going to make money on average. So let's go back to our graph here.

217
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:51,040
So we realize that the VIX on average outpaces realized volatility, okay?

218
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,360
It outpaces realized volatility. So on average,

219
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,140
those options are going to be expensive, right?

220
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,020
And let's actually plot what Eric was saying, okay?

221
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,480
What do we call it again, Eric? VRP.

222
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,340
Not a great graph, but you could see here, right? Here's the line.

223
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,520
Here's when realized vol and implied vol are the same. It's at this one line.

224
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,740
And you can see, right, in March 2020,

225
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,400
realized vol outpaced implied vol like crazy, okay?

226
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,000
So we lost a lot of money here. But there are some times where, you know,

227
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,360
if we go back to the last graph, right,

228
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,040
there are some times where the stock doesn't move at all, yet it was implying,

229
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,520
you know, 15% and it only realized 5.

230
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,870
So those are times you're going to make a lot of money selling volatility.

231
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,050
But then there's are going to be times, right? If we look over here,

232
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:56,380
for example, the market implied about 18% and it actually realized 85, right?

233
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,790
So, you know, selling vol here would be a big loser. But let's go see what the,

234
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,910
you know, what the mean is here.

235
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,220
And this data is going to be a little bit biased.

236
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,820
I can't go into the nitty gritty about that.

237
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,630
So what this is saying is that on average, okay, on average,

238
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,810
volatility is going to be 32%,

239
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,350
implied volatility is going to be 32% higher than realized vol, right?

240
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,270
So the implied vol might be, let's say 10, but the stock realizes 8.

241
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:43,450
So that's what the variance risk premium is. It's the premium, right?

242
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,460
We're getting this extra premium for selling volatility.

243
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,760
And so just like the equity risk premium, you know,

244
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,580
I could be here all day trying to back out, you know, the returns for this.

245
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,170
We are going to make some money.

246
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,630
Now the good news is the variance risk premium is a bit higher than the equity risk

247
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,320
premium. Okay. It's a bit higher, it's about 2% higher.

248
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,790
The bad part is it can be a lot trickier to take advantage of. Okay. Right.

249
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,170
We're going to have some Delta hedging involved, you know,

250
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,370
a little bit more transaction costs could be a little trickier.

251
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,610
So what you could do is, right, and I really like this one is selling puts,

252
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,090
right? Selling puts, what do they take advantage of? Well,

253
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,650
selling puts take advantage of, well, who's got it? I'm going to ask you guys,

254
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,350
what does puts take advantage of? What does, what, give me some of the,

255
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,510
give me some of the premiums for selling puts take advantage of and why?

256
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:48,460
Did you guys fall asleep? Oh, no, sorry. Oops. Sorry, guys. I didn't,

257
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,480
I was not scrolling down.

258
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:01,230
Trent saying some skew premium, some Delta and skew. Oh, great one, Marcos.

259
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:08,820
Great one, Marcos. Pulumi. Pulumi saying Delta skew and vol. Wow, Pulumi.

260
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,940
I thought, I thought you lost it, man. That's exactly right. Okay.

261
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,270
That's exactly right. The selling the put, right? Selling, what is it?

262
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,590
Let's think about the put. The put,

263
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:30,650
let's think about the structure of let's say a Delta 25 put. It is long Delta,

264
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,790
meaning equity risk premium.

265
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,620
Stonks go up. Stonks go up. So we get that long Delta.

266
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,060
The short put is short Vega,

267
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,870
meaning we get variance risk premium.

268
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,810
Okay. What about skew? Well, if you put it a little bit out of the money,

269
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,210
we get the skew premium.

270
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,300
So we can structure a trade that's going to take advantage of all three of these.

271
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,390
And, you know, that's why on average you see,

272
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,470
I don't know if you guys have ever seen the put index.

273
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,750
I'm going to find it for you guys right now, if you guys want to bear with me.

274
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,960
And Pulumi, I'm going to give you a call right after this, okay? SIBO put.

275
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,420
Okay. Oh, this is the skew index indices. Just bear with me here, guys.

276
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,280
We're going to figure this out.

277
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,640
SIBO benchmarks.

278
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,580
Look, they even have an iron butterfly one. Okay. Okay.

279
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,110
20 Delta buy right index. So this would be selling those covered calls,

280
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,410
those Delta covered calls, right? Let's see how this is done.

281
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,710
Oh, is this here, right? It's done okay. It's done okay. Oh, look,

282
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,890
they got the same graphs as the terminal.

283
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,180
Okay. Let's look for the put right index.

284
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,200
5% protection put. What do you guys think that one looks like?

285
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,360
Buying Delta 5% puts.

286
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,000
Buying Delta 5% puts. Put right index. Here we go.

287
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,900
Here it is, guys.

288
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,760
And you can see it's done very well, right?

289
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,340
I won't be able to compare it though. Compare. Here we go, guys. Here we go.

290
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:28,470
Okay. So let's see if we can figure this out, guys.

291
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,020
You know what? They don't make it easy.

292
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,040
They don't make it easy. But so right now we're getting a little bit of,

293
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,800
so it's going to look like under performance,

294
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,880
but it's going to be a higher sharp. So you can scale. Man, so bad.

295
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,160
Sorry, guys. You know what? Should I do it? What time is it? 840?

296
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,540
Should I download and plot?

297
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,280
Let's do that.

298
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,360
This guy needs a new computer. Someone get this guy a new computer.

299
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,420
Are you guys still with me or did everyone fall asleep?

300
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,380
Let me give a little like or something.

301
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,500
Give a thumbs up on tonight's live if you're still awake.

302
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,990
Sorry, guys. It looks like it's not happening.

303
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,610
SIBO needs to get their stuff together.

304
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,720
Long story short, there's been a lot of research, a lot of studying,

305
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,980
a lot of data that's gone into it.

306
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,320
The put indexes outperform the SPY on a better risk-adjusted return.

307
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,880
So you can get leverage.

308
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,250
You can get leverage by doing so.

309
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,080
Selling puts has a better risk-adjusted return. It's not much better.

310
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,740
Otherwise,

311
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:47,070
everyone just sells puts and then that variant risk premium disappears on average.

312
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,090
And of course, it's going to go through periods of drawdown. Hey, Lawrence,

313
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,720
great to see you, man. The only person that said here, everyone else is... Oh,

314
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:06,880
here we go. Never mind. Hey, Blessing. Okay, Blessing's saying, yeah,

315
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,980
Blessing's saying, I'm a little bit confused here. And you know what, Blessing,

316
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,960
that is totally okay.

317
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,520
I think Steven is also a bit confused here because I'm not hearing much from him.

318
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,260
So let's talk about it, Blessing. What is going through your head?

319
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,980
What's a bit challenging here? I am usually not the best at explaining stuff.

320
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:32,640
So,

321
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,980
all right. So I'm going through the comments now.

322
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,890
So if you sell one-year puts... Marcos, this is 30-day puts.

323
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,960
This is selling 30-day puts.

324
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,320
Do you have the risk of a naked put? Yes. So Blessing,

325
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,160
the risk of a naked put is the same as the risk of a stock on the downside,

326
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:29,080
right? If the stock goes down, it can go all the way to you know, down to zero,

327
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,720
just like with a put, right? You sell that put,

328
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,330
the stock can go all the way down to zero. And so that's why, right?

329
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,970
You're getting that equity risk premium embedded in that put.

330
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,820
If we look at what a put looks like versus the call, right?

331
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,150
So here's our short put, right? This is the payoff for our short put.

332
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,770
And if we look at the stock payoff, it looks like this,

333
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,840
right? So both of these have that risk to the downside.

334
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,300
And so you're getting compensated for bearing that risk.

335
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,820
Marco's saying you beat SPY in the long run.

336
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,760
You beat SPY in the long run marginally. You know, it's not a huge beat, right?

337
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,600
Because variance risk premium and the equity risk premium are correlated,

338
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,460
right? You got correlated risk premiums.

339
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,820
Okay. Yeah. Risk adjusted. Exactly, right?

340
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,300
So the other thing Steve's saying is, well, if you leverage up, right,

341
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,000
you're going to have some more risk, right? The stock continues to go down,

342
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,420
right? Well, you can be in trouble, right? You can have some big jump risk.

343
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,380
And then the broker calls you and says, you're being liquidated. Okay.

344
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,900
And there are certain things that have higher risk premiums,

345
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,740
like premium on the S&P 500 has a higher risk premium than selling puts on CCL.

346
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,440
So is there any questions about that?

347
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,780
And a lot of people have made millions and millions and millions of dollars selling

348
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,360
puts and making funds and selling puts. They get too greedy. They leverage up,

349
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,280
they blow up, but it's not their money.

350
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,540
But a lot of people have made millions and millions and millions and millions of

351
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,330
dollars selling puts.

352
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,400
The liquid love,

353
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,610
Sean looking at liquid love?

354
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,940
Is that what Sean's doing late at night?

355
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,610
Far left.

356
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,120
Oh yeah. Yeah, right. I don't know. I'm scared to open that.

357
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm scared to open that.

358
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:37,560
So no, no. Cause you're listening to a liquid love on YouTube. So yeah, yeah,

359
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,440
yeah. It's good. It's good stuff. You guys hear that? It's good stuff. Okay.

360
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,400
So Steven saying on Bloomberg, I'm not sure we're talking about there, Steve,

361
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,300
but guys, that is basically the live.

362
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,420
I hope we all understand what the variance risk premium is now.

363
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,570
We went into pretty extensive detail about what it is.

364
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:03,800
And what it basically means is that on average, you're going to get paid.

365
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,360
On average, just like the equity risk premium,

366
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,780
every single day you get paid a small amount of money,

367
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
even if you don't see it that day.

368
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,210
So any questions? Otherwise I will be signing out.

369
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,820
I think it was good. What'd you guys think? Was it a good one?

370
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,670
They set up so good. Like just like, I just really want,

371
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,110
I like love talking in this, this thing. It's great. Right.

372
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,690
You look like you're in a spaceship. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Guys,

373
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:44,250
this liquid love playlist. It's really cool. And look, like I'll mute it.

374
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,110
Look at the background. It's a little skeptical.

375
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,530
It's all these like little coral reef things.

376
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,940
That looks a little skeptical. If you ask me, Sean, it looks a little,

377
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,600
what the hell is that?

378
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,440
It's the ocean. It's the ocean. I don't know. Eric,

379
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,020
what do you think about that, man? What do you think in there, Eric?

380
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,570
Yeah, I know. Blessing. Mine too. Mine too. Blessing. Yeah. It's a,

381
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,670
it's a good, if you like, like, you know, I don't know. It's funky music.

382
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,970
That's for sure. Okay. Let's see the good laughs here. Let's see all the lols.

383
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,890
Okay. So blessing. Nice. So blessing saying, how do you execute?

384
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:49,440
So you sell a 30 day and every 20 days,

385
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,250
buy it back and sell a new one or let it expire and sell a new one.

386
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,190
So you're just basically doing it. It's just like buying a stock, right?

387
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,370
If you want to get exposure to that equity risk premium,

388
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,280
you just buy the stock.

389
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,660
If you want to get exposure to the variance risk premium or this risk premium that

390
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,710
we talked about, the combination of a couple of risk premiums, sell the put,

391
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,320
sell the put and just roll it.

392
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,240
Just keep rolling and rolling and rolling and know that there are going to be some

393
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,420
big losses. That's why you get paid. And the beauty,

394
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,330
the beauty of this a blessing is that we can go back in time to when the victims

395
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,410
created in 1999.

396
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:35,100
And we will see that this variance risk premium has lasted for years, right?

397
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,940
Something has lasted for years, 30 years, 40 years. So we have confidence.

398
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,700
I think this thing is probably going to last in the future or continue to be in

399
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,560
the future, right? There's going to be losing periods though, right?

400
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,030
As Marcos was saying, if it never had losing periods,

401
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,570
there would be no risk premium. It has to lose, right?

402
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,810
You have to pay out sometimes.

403
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,950
There's going to be periods where it doesn't work, right? But in the long run,

404
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,990
you guys can talk to Steve about this,

405
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,250
like value momentum risk premiums and oh, Pulumi, Pulumi still alive?

406
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,540
Pulumi? There's going to be risk premiums, right?

407
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:18,550
That go through really bad periods and periods that are like value, right?

408
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,470
And periods are really good.

409
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,530
Eric, they are the Delta 50. They're the Delta 50.

410
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:31,050
I believe the Delta 40s or Delta... Steve B, if you don't mind,

411
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,510
can you post the paper from AQR in the group? Delta 30 puts,

412
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,410
those have the highest sharp ratio, Delta 30 puts.

413
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,860
Marcos is saying, so if you sell every time it spikes on average,

414
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,240
you increase your chances.

415
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:01,620
Okay, Marcos. So the answer is you increase the chance of it coming back down,

416
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,000
right? Because it's mean reverting, but that's adding,

417
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,420
you are now adding a filter. You're adding a statistical signal, right?

418
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,080
And so you're also missing a lot of the times where it doesn't spike.

419
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,940
Like look at this whole year in 2017, where you got no spikes,

420
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,420
you got maybe one or two spikes and you missed out on months and months of collecting

421
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,000
that risk premium. So there are strategies though. So like, for example,

422
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:41,600
a strategy is sell puts when the VIX term structure is in contango, okay?

423
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,840
Sell puts when the VIX term structure is in contango,

424
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,900
buy those puts back when it's not. So here, let me just show you super quick,

425
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,920
Marcos. But now we're building a strategy. So that's something different,

426
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,510
right? We're just talking about collecting a risk premium, okay? That's there.

427
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,710
It's always there. It's there for everybody. You sell those day in, day out,

428
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
okay? But you can get better, right? You can do better than a risk premium,

429
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,830
right? But now we're talking about building a strategy.

430
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,710
That's going to be for a totally different life,

431
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,470
but I'll just super quickly tell you. That's how a lot of funds work.

432
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,940
When this is looking like this, okay? When it's looking like this,

433
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,900
you sell the puts, okay? You sell the puts. When it goes backward, okay?

434
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,000
You buy back those puts, okay?

435
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,270
So when the front month is above the second month, you buy back those puts,

436
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:42,190
okay? And the reason for that is, is because, let me show you, Marcos.

437
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:54,850
What that does, Marcos, is this. It keeps you always in on this period,

438
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:07,400
but it gets you out, Marcos, right here, so that you don't have that huge loss.

439
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,850
But what's the downside to that? Well, Marcos, it also gets you out right here,

440
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,870
and it gets you out right here,

441
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,520
okay? So by doing that, it stops the blowouts, okay?

442
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,190
But you give up buying back at the worst possible time.

443
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,780
Then you can add a second filter that basically says, well, if we add this,

444
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,600
well, now we actually stayed in during this one,

445
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,640
and we stayed in during this one, and this one.

446
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,290
So now we just added some benefits.

447
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,480
But that's strategy development, Marcos. That is not for tonight's live.

448
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,240
But I love how you're thinking, dude.

449
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,060
Blessing, so not just on the VIX, you can sell it on the S&P 500,

450
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,800
but you can sell it on the VIX. It's another risk premium you can collect.

451
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,260
That's called the vol of vol, okay, right? The VIX is volatility,

452
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,250
and we're selling volatility on the volatility, right?

453
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,810
So that's going to be for another live as well. It's like inception. Exactly,

454
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,110
exactly. And then you can sell vol on vol on vol.

455
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,120
That's the inception risk premium. You don't even know if you're in anymore.

456
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,020
Exactly. You might be trading delta one at that point. Yes.

457
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,020
Okay, guys, that is the live tonight. That was a good live.

458
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,560
That was a fun live. And we will see you guys back next week.

459
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,100
So have a wonderful night, everyone. Hope you didn't miss me too much.

460
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,380
He's right there, guys. I'm here, guys.

461
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,020
And I'll be sending the liquid squidly love to everybody. Oh, it's just,

462
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:11,640
don't send it to anyone. I'm sending it to Trent. Okay, and blessing.

463
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,450
I'll send that to you as well. Okay, see you guys.

464
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,910
At least let me post up the shame.
