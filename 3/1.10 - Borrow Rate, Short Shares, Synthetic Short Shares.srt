1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,990
How's it going, everyone? In today's live,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:12,160
we're going to be chatting about the borrow rate and how to find it.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,180
And what does it mean? What does the borrow rate mean? And also,

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,120
how to synthetically short shares when there's none to borrow. You know,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,600
we hear this all the time. Oh, you know, I really want to short this stock,

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,210
but I can't borrow it. Right? And so, as traders,

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,170
we always got to try to find workarounds. Right? And so,

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,390
there's lots of ways that we can do that. So,

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,920
that's what we're going to be talking about in tonight's live. Oh, wow. Pulumi,

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,410
what's up, man? What's up, dude? Haven't seen you in a while. Okay. So,

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,530
let's jump right into it. So,

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,790
we're going to actually be talking about a couple of the hype stocks just because

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,510
we are seeing it there. Okay? So, let's jump right into it right now.

14
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,990
So, let's take a look at GME. Okay, here's GME.

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,910
And, whoa.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,170
Sorry, guys. I haven't seen GME today.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,170
Sean, did you know this? What happened? That it's trading at this high?

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,210
I didn't know it got to $3.80 now.

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,560
Okay. So, when we look at GME, guys, you know what's moving after hours.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,980
We're just going to mess our data up. So,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,460
let me just pull that up real quick and we can see it. Okay,

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:51,880
so GME closed at $3.45. Okay, so GME closed at $3.45. So,

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,570
let's go over to this. We'll go over to the 350 strike here. Now,

24
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,570
what do we notice about this 350 strike? Well,

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:07,760
one thing that I noticed right off the bat is that these puts are trading $20 more

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,010
than these same equivalent calls. Right? Do you guys notice that?

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,430
That the ask here is $1.87. The ask here is $2.04. The bid is $1.72.

28
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,870
And the bid here is $1.65. It's trading so much more than, you know,

29
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,070
the puts are trading so much more than the calls. Now,

30
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,810
let's take a look at something like Apple, for example.

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,550
So, let me just make sure Apple doesn't have some… Wow.

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:53,650
So, Apple closed at $1.42.55. So, if we go to $1.42,

33
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,380
well,

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:03,100
what we notice is that basically the mid here of this option is going to be very

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,140
similar to the mid of this option. Right?

36
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,720
We can see $1.42 trading at the mid at $7.95.

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,290
And the mid over here is trading at $7.70. Okay? So,

38
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,670
they're trading almost exactly the same.

39
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,830
Now, what is causing that? Right?

40
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,880
What is causing that GME to have such a big difference? Okay? Well, Jordan,

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,640
maybe, you know, we need to mention something here because… Well, maybe,

42
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,800
why is Apple so different from GME? Right? Why is GME the different one? Right?

43
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,900
What do we normally see? Yes.

44
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,750
What we normally see is that the Apple money strikes should be trading the same

45
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,710
extrinsic value. Okay? Why is that?

46
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,900
And if they weren't trading at extrinsic value,

47
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,920
there could be an arbitrage done. Right? You could basically sell the put,

48
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,440
buy the call, and then short shares.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,460
And we're going to talk about that as we go through with the borrow cost. So,

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,520
here's a quick example. Let's say we want to put on this risk reversal. Okay?

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,840
So, someone might come in here and say, Oh, look.

52
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,710
What do we say? $3.50. Oh, look. There's an arbitrage. Right?

53
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:31,080
I can buy these for, you know, $170 and sell these for $200. Same strike.

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,240
Right? Let's take a look.

55
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,690
So, we're going to buy the calls and we're going to sell the puts.

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:06,620
I think there's some data really messing this up here.

57
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,980
Let's see if we can do it on AMC here.

58
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,270
Anyways, this will cost us about,

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,980
okay. What we can see here right away is that, look at our P&L. Right?

60
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,920
We are all the way back here. Okay. So, the stock's trading at $3.40. Oh,

61
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,380
that's why.

62
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,800
So, the stock's trading at $3.50.

63
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,560
Guys, you know what? We can't do it with this. The data is just too bad.

64
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,500
Do you want to try one more stock?

65
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,750
It's only with AMC and GME that we're seeing this. Plus,

66
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,530
it's after-hours data that's messing up the whole thing. Okay, draw it. Yeah.

67
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,700
Go forward in time so it comes off the graph. Or, go back.

68
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,230
Here's what you can do.

69
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,240
Go forward in time so that it disappears off the thing.

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,420
Oh, I like that. Good idea. Oops. Okay, keep going.

71
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,620
Okay, go forward again. Keep going. Will it disappear completely?

72
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,020
Alright, drop it to $0 for $0.01. I can actually increase it here.

73
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,710
You could basically come into the market here, sell the put, buy the call,

74
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,700
and GME's trading at $3.47, but our break-even is $3.25.

75
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,160
When we buy the stock, what does it look like? Right? When we buy the stock,

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:28,120
our break-even starts at $3.47.

77
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,720
Right? But look at this. So, if we buy Apple at $100 and it goes to $99,

78
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,750
we lose $1. But with this combo,

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,420
GME's trading at $3.47, but we can buy it at $3.25.

80
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,060
There's an issue here. Right? We could arbitrage this way, obviously.

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:02,410
We can just sell some shares and create a perfect arbitrage. Right?

82
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,310
Where P&L starts at $22,000.

83
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,800
However,

84
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,340
the reason why this is existing on GME stock is because everyone is short the stock.

85
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,900
Okay? Everyone is selling this stock. And so, for that reason,

86
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,840
the borrow rate is increasing. Right? The cost to borrow this thing,

87
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,320
it's getting hard to borrow. And so, if I'm going to lend my shares out,

88
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,610
I'm going to charge a huge premium. Because no one else is giving it up. Right?

89
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,470
So, if I give them up, I'm going to charge you a huge premium.

90
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:42,680
And that is why we see this in GME. It's because of that borrow cost.

91
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,150
The cost to borrow these shares. If I'm going to short these shares,

92
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,580
right? If I'm going to short these shares, well,

93
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,700
it's going to cost me $22,000 during that period. Right?

94
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,860
And that's why we're seeing this, you know, plus $22,000.

95
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,930
So, always remember that when we're coming into trading, you know,

96
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,450
people might say, you know, it's hard to borrow, I can't short the shares.

97
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,870
We can synthetically replicate those shares by creating this risk reversal.

98
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:21,840
Okay?

99
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,640
But instead, we sell the calls and buy the puts. Okay?

100
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,920
We sell the calls and buy the puts. But now, look at what's happening here.

101
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,290
We are now shorting the shares at $325. But the stock is trading at $347.

102
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:49,360
And that is simply just because of the borrow rate.

103
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,720
How the cost for you to be able to short those shares, right? Every single day,

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,630
if you're going to borrow someone shares, you have to pay them money. Right?

105
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,210
Every single day,

106
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,030
money's going to come out of your account that you have to pay the owners of those

107
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,160
shares. And this is what we are seeing here. Because that's, you know,

108
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,920
you're loaning them. Right? Whenever you loan anything, you know,

109
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,720
you're paying interest.

110
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,900
It's what makes it worth it for the other person to loan it.

111
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Exactly. How is that rate determined?

112
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,400
It's strictly determined just by how many sellers there are.

113
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,740
It's simply the market dynamics. Supply and demand, right?

114
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,580
If there's 50 million shares to go around,

115
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,640
then I know everybody is trying to sell these things. Well, if I'm the buyer,

116
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,750
I'm just going to be like, well, you're going to have to pay up. Exactly.

117
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,420
Right? And so the more and more people that come and try and short this thing,

118
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:56,090
the more and more we're going to see this happening. Right?

119
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,070
Where it's not easy to short. Right? Think about what's happening here.

120
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,720
The market's telling us that they think the stock is going to go down to 325.

121
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,060
At least.

122
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,790
And it's a no-brainer that eventually that this stock is going to go back down.

123
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,010
Right? And so, well, everyone's trying to do it.

124
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,300
And it's just getting harder and harder and harder. Right?

125
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,680
I would love to go and buy these puts. Right?

126
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,880
I would love to go and buy some 260 puts.

127
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,150
Guess what?

128
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:33,320
They're trading at such a premium because of that borrow cost being embedded into

129
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,730
that option. Right? It's easier to buy a call option. Let's see, 260.

130
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,390
So remember, this is at, so the stock was trading at 350. Okay,

131
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,710
so a 260 call option would be equivalent to,

132
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,270
I guess because of the volatility. Oh, this stock is so,

133
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:05,430
it's really out of whack. But it'd be basically equivalent to, you know,

134
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,730
buying a lot closer option. Okay? In terms of volatility.

135
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,580
So I know the data kind of, you know, messes up a little bit here, guys.

136
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,460
You know, the after hours data, GME being down 50 bucks after hours,

137
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,770
kind of messed with the data. But if you guys have any questions about this,

138
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,170
maybe you guys asking me questions can help me, you know,

139
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,070
really explain this a lot better. Yeah, Jordan,

140
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,710
I think while we're waiting for questions here, without using the live,

141
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,690
like take off the screen for a second. Just like explain it,

142
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,530
like try and walk through like, you know, what we're looking at here, right?

143
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,790
And why it's a value to look at.

144
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,190
So what we're looking at here is the borrow rate. Okay?

145
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,880
How much it costs to borrow the shares if you want to short them. Now, yeah,

146
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,660
if you want to short these shares, right?

147
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,280
It's a no-brainer that in the long run, this thing is going to go down.

148
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,760
And you can do that through buying puts, through shorting shares.

149
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,210
But the issue is everyone wants to do it, right? You might, you know,

150
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,270
there might, you might think, oh, everyone's buying these call options,

151
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,700
but there are a lot of people betting against this stock, right?

152
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,600
A lot of hedge funds, a lot of big money, not the small money,

153
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,500
but the big money betting against this thing.

154
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,730
And so that's going to drive up this borrow rate,

155
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,010
especially because there's no shares. There's 50 million shares.

156
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,620
So for that reason, the borrow rate,

157
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,940
the cost to borrow these shares are going to be very expensive.

158
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:55,360
And we can actually determine that rate by looking at the synthetic short shares,

159
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,040
which is the same as selling the call and buying a put on the same strike.

160
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,580
You are creating short shares. Okay, there's zero difference.

161
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,960
If there's a zero, if there's anything more than a zero difference,

162
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,360
an arbitrage exists, okay? Risk-free money exists. So Jordan,

163
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,480
when you look at the synthetic short shares,

164
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:30,120
how do you use that to determine the borrow rate? So in this case, you take,

165
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,580
so let me just show an example here.

166
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,100
So in this case, let's say it was $25,

167
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:48,150
okay? When we added up the puts and the calls, we got a credit of $25, okay,

168
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:54,290
for going long these shares. Well, you take $25, okay?

169
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,480
You divide it by however much notional value there is.

170
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,660
So let's say for example, it was $25 for 10 contracts,

171
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:14,090
which is 10 times about 350,000, okay? But obviously in option terms, 3,000,

172
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:28,030
here, 3 would be 350. It would be 2,500 over 350,000.

173
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,560
And so this would give us a number like 8% or, Sean, do you want to go here?

174
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,700
Let me pull up the math super quick.

175
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,860
It wouldn't be 8%. You want to fix that 2? It looks like a 7. Oh, it's 25,000,

176
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,400
not 2,500. Sorry, guys.

177
00:15:53,170 --> 00:16:04,970
25,000 over 350,000, which would be about 8%, okay? But this is 8% in 15 days.

178
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,920
So you would make 8% in 15 days,

179
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,120
right? Well, how many days are there in a year? Well, 365.

180
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:21,070
You just have to compound that out, right? So 365 divided by 15, right?

181
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,410
And that equals 2.

182
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,230
Sorry, Jordan. I can't help out. My phone's not in the room. That's okay, dude.

183
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,290
So equals to 24,

184
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,500
okay? So we have 24 periods of this 8%, right?

185
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,420
So we just do 1.08 to the power of 24.

186
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,100
Cool. It's saying it's 171.

187
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,140
So there it is. 171% to borrow these shares per year.

188
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,180
And I think it's a lot higher. The after-hour data isn't good,

189
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
but I think this number is actually a lot higher.

190
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,090
I think it's a lot closer to 3,500. 3,500 on a 350,000 notional.

191
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,320
So finish your thought.

192
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,320
I'm just going to follow up with some questions to dig a little deeper.

193
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,960
So it's going to be roughly about 250% a year to short these shares.

194
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,590
So how is it above 100%? Like what happens here?

195
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,370
In terms of how can it be above 100%? Oh, is there a spider on the laptop?

196
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,220
On the screen? Yeah, there is. It just crawled over the webcam.

197
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,770
One thing about these mosquitoes down here is they're fast, man.

198
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,630
They're so fast. Yeah, and dude, you're sleeping outside.

199
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,590
Do you have a mosquito net on your bed? No, this is where I'm sleeping.

200
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,950
You're sleeping in the jungle. Okay, I get it. Okay.

201
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,650
So when somebody just goes to short shares,

202
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,030
do they not typically know the borrow rate?

203
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,170
Do most people who short shares not know this? Yeah, probably not.

204
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,630
Probably not, to be honest. How are you charged it?

205
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,990
It's just going to come out. Comes out of your margin, out of your account.

206
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,190
Out of your account, right?

207
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,930
The owners are going to ask for it and the brokerage is just going to grab it from

208
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,290
you. Is it billed daily, weekly, monthly? Every single day.

209
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,670
Every single day money will come out of your account. Wow.

210
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,630
So is this the only way to see the borrow rate? Can you call your brokerage?

211
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,800
Like how would somebody who doesn't know about options go about figuring this out?

212
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,250
Some brokerages quote it. You probably have to give them a call and say, hey,

213
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,550
what's the borrow rate? You know, for example, Aria on E-Trade,

214
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,450
he said that he had to call them. Wow. Right? Yeah,

215
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,890
so you have to call the brokerage or some of them have it,

216
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,690
but you can always just get it by pricing out the synthetic.

217
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,170
So how do you put yourself in a spot to be shorting your shares?

218
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,630
Let's say you hold a bunch of GME shares and you want to put them up for short.

219
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:22,050
Yep. So some brokers will allow you to be in that program. I know IB allows it,

220
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,710
but the thing is though they take a huge, huge chunk out of it.

221
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,120
So if you want that borrow rate, well,

222
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,660
what you could do is you could create the synthetic long.

223
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,320
If you want exposure to the GME borrow cost, you know, the 250% annually,

224
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,880
which is fantastic. Well, you can just buy the shares.

225
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,180
So, sorry, sorry, buy the synthetic.

226
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,190
Okay. And then let's say someone's sitting here thinking, you know, okay,

227
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,830
shorting shares sounds pretty cool.

228
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,770
Why don't I just buy some GME and short it out and I can make some income?

229
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,160
Well, because the broker is going to take a huge chunk of that.

230
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,050
A huge chunk of that borrow rate. So if you want the borrow rate,

231
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,650
it makes sense to do the synthetic.

232
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,420
I'm just trying to think if I can ask you any other trickier,

233
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,920
tricky kind of questions, you know, messy out maybe.

234
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,480
Anyone else have a question? Any questions guys?

235
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,990
How can over 100% of the float be shorted?

236
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,410
That's a good question that I do not have the answer for. Ah,

237
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,550
you got him Steve. Yeah, Steve. I don't have the answer for that one, dude.

238
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,830
Unless, you know, a couple things that could be bad data. Maybe there could be,

239
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,210
you know, some prop bets happening.

240
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,720
I don't really know how you could short shares that aren't available.

241
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,220
But maybe there is one. Is the synthetic more risky than shorting the shares?

242
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,200
No, same thing. It's the same exact same thing. If there was any difference,

243
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,820
you could arbitrage.

244
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,680
If the synthetic was different from the shorting of the shares,

245
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,020
you could create an arbitrage.

246
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,380
And there's been times where like, you know, back when we were looking at NKLA,

247
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,720
for example, where it actually was there, you just couldn't get the shares.

248
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,820
Which is really, really interesting.

249
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,030
So, any other questions here? It's not a very long live tonight, guys.

250
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,090
You know, it's just, you know,

251
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,970
every night the goal is really to go over a topic. You know,

252
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,850
we're compounding out our knowledge here, right? So, you know,

253
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,930
I know we had a little bit of trouble with the brokerage that kind of put a wrench

254
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,500
in our demonstration of it. But, you know,

255
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,040
we still want everyone here to walk away with the knowledge about the borrow rate.

256
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,580
So, please make sure to ask questions here. We'll give it another minute.

257
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,120
But besides that, that is the lesson for tonight.

258
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,800
So, ask away.

259
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,200
Yeah, if there's no more questions. Back straight up against that.

260
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,840
Sylvain. Sylvain's asking like, is synthetic, you know,

261
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,190
is synthetics a golden topic? No, not really, Sylvain. I mean,

262
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,550
you guys do synthetics all the time, right? Maybe you just don't know it.

263
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,190
You know,

264
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,730
the iron condor that we teach about in PA is just a synthetic butterfly. Right?

265
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:55,890
Synthetic just means replicating with other things. Right? So, for example,

266
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,530
synthetic leather shoe. You know,

267
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,490
you're creating this leather with something else that's not leather.

268
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,860
If you look at a butterfly versus an iron condor that we teach at PA, well,

269
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,590
they're the same structure. One is just a synthetic. Right? So,

270
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,170
you can do a lot of things. Like, for example,

271
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:21,380
doing a covered call is a synthetic short put. You know, I always hear,

272
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,580
you know, one of the questions I love asking people is I say, hey,

273
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,320
when they sell covered calls, I say, hey, would you sell a naked put?

274
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:36,990
And they say, no, too risky. Because that's way too risky for me. Well,

275
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,750
the short put is the same thing as a covered call. Right? So,

276
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,070
we do synthetics all the time.

277
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,550
Maybe it's just a bigger word. But it's really we do them all the time.

278
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,960
Now, Kiko is asking, can we do the box with GME?

279
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,770
So, Koaw, always remember, dude. Always remember. If an arbitrage exists,

280
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,550
it will almost always be taken advantage of until it dries up. Now,

281
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,290
as we both know, it does happen.

282
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,210
But it's not going to be like the box is going to be a moneymaker going forward.

283
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:28,470
There's nothing special about a box. It's used for certain things. For example,

284
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,810
extracting out a dividend. It's used for getting the interest rate. Right?

285
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,930
Because an option has interest rate baked into the price of them. Right?

286
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,290
It's part of the Black-Scholes model. And so,

287
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:48,760
the box is a way to get that LIBOR rate. But there's nothing special about it.

288
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,840
And then Eric has probably the best question of the night, which is,

289
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,460
did you pay extra for the lights tonight? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,600
Or did you just find the light switch? Yeah. No, no, no.

291
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,480
I think one of the guys came back and they were on. Wait, what?

292
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,880
I just came back and they were working. Wait,

293
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,120
so they were there before they weren't working? No, you know what?

294
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,060
I don't think they were even here, to be honest.

295
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,480
Because now I just click on the switch that I use all the time.

296
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,800
And now it works. But the plumbers here are super nice.

297
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,780
And I think he just helped me out. Yeah, Eric.

298
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm thinking it's all the rum as well. Guys, I didn't have one drop today.

299
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,500
I'm so pissed. I had one fucking drop. Right after this live,

300
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,240
I'm going to fucking chug a whole 60.

301
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,200
Yeah, you couldn't button switch last night. That's funny.

302
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,100
That's why the lights work today. Yeah, exactly.

303
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,560
Stephen's asking, what is the box? It's for a different topic, Stephen,

304
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,700
but super simple. You just do a vertical on either side of the market.

305
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,620
We can talk about that maybe tomorrow's live. Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

306
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,860
We can do it. No problem. I'm sure Stephen wants to look into it tonight.

307
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,180
Stephen, it's just like you can Google it.

308
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,380
It's just putting a vertical spread on both sides of the market.

309
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,480
So it looks like this.

310
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,690
All right, everyone. That is the topic for tonight.
