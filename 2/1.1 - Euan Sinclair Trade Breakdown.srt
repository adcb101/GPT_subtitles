1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Yeah, if we actually start breaking it down here step by step marks,

I Do a good job.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,340
It's all right I think if if trading doesn't work out and if predicting alpha falls

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,240
through I've always got a backup career as a barber Yeah, you know what? Yeah.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,960

Yeah Who did a better job?

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,820

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,440
is just so we can So we can all be on the same page. Yeah,

but why the hell should we listen to this guy? so Okay,

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,440
so you and Sinclair is waiting for his picture to load So you guys can you guys

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
can see who we're gonna be chatting about.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,400
So he's a funny-looking dude a It's kind of a funny-looking guy.

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,790
He's actually Australian and Really smart guy.

29
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,430
He's partner at the firm Talton Capital.

30
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,290
He used to work as a serious trader for Bluefin Before going out on his own to become

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,650
a professional to be a partner in the firm So he went from trader to partner in

32
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,710
the firm and he's been trading options for you know,

33
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:45,110
probably over 25 years really smart guy has his PhD and Absolutely dominated the

34
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,170
the option space.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,230
He's decided to give a lot back to the the options community and he's written a

36
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,230
few Really good bucks.

37
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,150
You really good book really good books so we're gonna go through one of his trade

38
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,910
breakdowns and You know how it played out how he managed his risk and the whole

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,720
the whole play-by-play so you guys can see What an eight-figure trader does and

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,280
when I mean eight-figure trader I don't mean he's making a hundred and fifty percent

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,620
a year on you know,

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,600
a million dollars or five hundred thousand bucks What I'm saying is he manages a

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,860
lot of money And so he might make you know,

44
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,980
25 35 40 percent a year on his on his capital So with that said let's jump right

45
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,660
into it. So guys pay really good attention here. Okay,

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
this is very important You know,

47
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:46,860
it's it's it's really critical to learn from an in-depth Example so I recommended

48
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,800
this book to almost everyone in this in this group here It's called volatility trading.

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,100
It is a little bit Difficult,

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,280
it's pretty math intensive is a little math intensive For that reason we're gonna

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,360
we're gonna break it down here.

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:12,140
Are we all good guys? Looks good Maddie saying great book. Okay, perfect.

53
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,020
Thanks mark. Hey mark. Hey, great to see you here, man. Okay,

54
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,510
so This is gonna take me about I'd say 30 minutes to get through 20 minutes to get

55
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,540
through but this is a real-world example so in this chapter,

56
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,720
we are going to Break down a volatility trade that you and Sinclair did.

57
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,850
Okay from you know a predetermined plan to Consistently re-evaluating the position

58
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,990
so that our exposure is a reflection of our current thoughts Okay,

59
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,490
and we always say if we don't want to be in a position we get out of that position

60
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,990
And then finally they exit the trade and they go through an in-depth analysis of

61
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,720
what happened pre-trade analysis So the pre-trade planning analysis is usually the

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,300
most important part of any trade this is especially true for volatility trading

63
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,040
aka option trading as Our edge will only be accumulated slowly and noisily Without

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,160
a good plan in place.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,480
It is very easy to second-guess ourselves during the trade So we're gonna have a

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,100
strict plan.

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,470
We have to understand the plan So Apple was a darling of the markets.

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,750
This is June 25th,

69
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,690
2007 Apple was a darling of the market positioned at the confluence of the fashion

70
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,320
and technology industries It could seemingly do no wrong and its share price increased

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,780
more than a hundred and twenty five dollars per share Over the previous five years.

72
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,160
It had rallied on a split adjusted basis from eight dollars and fifty seven Which

73
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,810
was an increase of over one thousand percent Compared to the market where it only

74
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,490
moved fifty four percent So what he's saying is this stock was in the news people

75
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,160
were loving this stock Everyone was buying it and I don't know if you guys remember

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,640
he was talking about the Mac versus PC commercials Those were fantastic.

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,080
I don't you guys remember those but the iPhone was scheduled for launch Okay,

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,200
and this is you know, obviously a brand new product comes in market.

79
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,200
There was a lot of hype around there So June 29 was expected to be the catalyst

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:30,190
for another explosive burst right June 29th was the launch of the iPhone Apple was

81
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,360
a perfect example of the stock that people that many people expected to rally and

82
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,320
rally big Conversely,

83
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,500
the hype was attracting the standard number of contrarian types who were predicting

84
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,490
a huge flop This is the sort of situation that can easily result in overpriced options

85
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,330
as directional traders bet on large moves Bidding up the value of both the puts

86
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,190
and the calls Remember we said guys that 99% of option traders use options to buy

87
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,930
calls and puts to take directional views Though so that is what was happening here

88
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,930
People were buying and selling buying calls and puts to take directional views on

89
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,510
Apple and by doing that It was there was no one selling everyone was buying so it's

90
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:20,670
increasing the demand and there was no not enough supply So July implied volatility

91
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,250
has been going had been going progressively morbid for several weeks meaning it

92
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:37,370
was increasing rallying from the mid 20s to the high 30s After some discussion and

93
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,690
eyeballing the data We'd arrived at a consensus that the forecast of realized volatility

94
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:52,680
over the next three weeks Would be 29% and the July implied volatility was 41% So

95
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:03,170
if we go back to our graphs here, let's see if he posted the Okay,

96
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,530
so he's saying that the forecast of realized volatility is gonna be 29% That's what

97
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:15,290
he's forecasting. But the implied volatility was 41% Okay,

98
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,930
so this gave an edge of 41% Right in the way.

99
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:33,780
He calculated that was just simply it's this 41 minus 29 Right,

100
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,480
which is giving us 12 and we take 12 and divide it by 29.

101
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,880
Okay, so we've got 41% He thinks the realize is gonna be 29 implied is 41.

102
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,340
The normal spread for Apple was around 20 to 25 percent Meaning usually there is

103
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:04,360
a bias of 20 to 25 percent. But in this case, it was 41 percent Okay,

104
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,740
and then to put it in the overall context the S&P 500 Basically the vault the VIX

105
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,920
index right the volatility of the S&P 500 was only 31 percent higher than the forecast

106
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:24,840
volatility So here he shows a few of the volatility measures of Apple So the realized

107
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,860
volatility remember in the predicting alpha terminal we have the time series graph

108
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,000
of the realized volatility Here, maybe should I show that right now or just?

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,460
Yeah,

110
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,710
so here are all the different types of volatility models He's looking at so the

111
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,690
Garmin cloths volatility the Parkinson the close to close This is what he's looking

112
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,890
at right and we don't need to understand what these are We actually take care of

113
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:57,460
this in the terminal So he has all his different types of volatility here And so

114
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,500
what he did was he had all this these different models these different types of

115
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,320
volatility estimates So for example The yangzang was 31 the close to close was 28

116
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,230
and what he did was he took the average of all of these different estimates Which

117
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,490
gave him an estimate of 29 percent?

118
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,420
So that was his forecast of realized volatility at this point We were reasonably

119
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,120
confident that we had an edge in the spread between implied and realized volatility

120
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,200
both on absolute and relative levels We also had a clear catalyst that has caused

121
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,540
the spread and which and which we thought was being overplayed by the popular media

122
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,590
We decided to go short Apple implied volatility Now this is exactly I don't know

123
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,350
if you guys already seen this. This is exactly what you guys do right,

124
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,820
we We forecast volatility then we understand why volatility is there and then if

125
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,050
it makes sense we take a trade So during the so before we continue guys because

126
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,470
we're gonna go into Placing the trade.

127
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,510
So do you guys have any questions about what he's doing here?

128
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:19,400
Because then we're gonna jump into The actual actual the actual trade you have 30

129
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,380
seconds any questions?

130
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,600
How did he develop his forecast? Yeah,

131
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:34,430
so What he did was he basically took How much the stock moves so different models?

132
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,890
So let's say for example the yangzang actually We'll look at the close to close

133
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,910
because this is gonna make a lot of sense to you It's what's in think or swim the

134
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,220
close to close is basically how much the stock moves Every single day.

135
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,300
So let's say he looked at the last 20 days and he said well on average the stock

136
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,920
moves 10% Right,

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,950
that would be a volatility of 160 right 16 times the average daily move That's gonna

138
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,220
be your close to close volatility. So in this case Dan Daniel,

139
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,090
we got 28 Divided by 16 is about 1.5 1.7 percent.

140
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,000
So over the last let's say 20 days The stock Apple was only moving one point seven

141
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,180
percent a day So which we had a close to close volatility of 28 So this is just

142
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,450
one input then he would do something like the yangzang model the Parkinson,

143
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,430
right? We have the garch just like in the terminal.

144
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,140
So that's how he came up with these forecasts and then he averaged them all then

145
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,680
he averaged them all because each one has a little bit of a different view on the

146
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
market and if you take the Average of you know,

147
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,600
the crowd usually get a good estimate of the future.

148
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,860
Is there any questions about that? We're gonna we're gonna move on here.

149
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,250
Looks like we're good.

150
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,340
So here we go. Here's the trade starts During the afternoon of June 25th.

151
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:18,300
We started to sell we sold a 12 lot of July 125 calls at five dollars and ten cents

152
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:27,500
and bought five hundred shares at 124 so we basically sold it at 41 percent forty

153
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,420
one point two percent implied volatility So remember we talked about Selling an

154
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,920
option and then buying the shares selling a call like we did on I know for example

155
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,740
Where we sold the call we bought some shares against it and that's gonna create

156
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:53,310
something that looks like a straddle later How did he okay and then Daniels asking?

157
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,210
Hedging deltas. Yes. So let me just quickly show you guys here.

158
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,680
I gotta load it up Shouldn't be that bad. Okay,

159
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,520
well while that's loading we're gonna continue So later as the market broke we sold

160
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,200
50 of the July 125 straddles so you guys are familiar with this.

161
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:19,820
He sold the 125 straddles for $10 and 70 cents and then he also hedged his deltas

162
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,890
and Sold some shares against it at the end of the day.

163
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:33,370
We were short $1,450 worth of Vega now, this is a silver concept.

164
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,190
So I'm not gonna go too much in depth on this But what this basically means is that

165
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,600
if the stock the implied volatility went down one one point he would make $1,450

166
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:53,490
so this was giving an expected profit of roughly $16,000 so we had his expected

167
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,370
value already pre-planned Before he entered the trade or as he entered the trade,

168
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:05,250
but this number I'm telling you right now was already pre-planned Okay,

169
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,970
our hedging band don't worry about this.

170
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,610
We don't need to worry about this He hedged is he was figuring out his hedging his

171
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:20,350
risk management strategy here So we calculated it you know his all his Greeks his

172
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,170
haircut on the position meaning his margin on the position how much he has to post

173
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:30,200
up and His daily P&L now right away when he's making these trades he has transaction

174
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,800
costs He has a you know trade the cross the bid-ask spread.

175
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,200
So right off the bat.

176
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,120
He's down $121 just like you guys saw in the live when I was trading as soon as

177
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:47,510
I entered a position I'm already down a bit the next day Apple opened up slightly

178
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:55,580
higher at 123.97 in line with a slight rally in the overall market and the stock

179
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,360
dropped later in the morning We sold 50 more shares, I'm sorry,

180
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,090
we sold 50 more 125 calls and Under hedged them slightly to stay within our Delta

181
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,390
band.

182
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:14,490
Don't worry about that Our total expected P&L was now $20,000 and our hedging band

183
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,390
widened to 1,000 shares again.

184
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:25,100
Let's not worry about that that that silver concept So this was a very quiet day

185
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,510
in the market No hedging required and when he says hedging he means no Delta hedging

186
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,680
No hedging with the shares. No buying and selling the shares.

187
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,900
You can see his P&L now Yeah,

188
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,740
so his P&L for the day was five thousand three hundred thirty-eight.

189
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,440
His total P&L was three hundred and eighty-five So because there was a quiet day

190
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,900
right and we're short volatility Then if there's nothing happening today,

191
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,100
we are gonna collect our theta and not pay anything out.

192
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,600
Okay,

193
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,000
so he made five thousand three hundred thirty-eight on the day which put him up

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,280
to three hundred eighty-five So June 28th the next day another very quiet day Amazing.

195
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,110
He's short volatility. He's just collecting the premium here.

196
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:26,550
Let's see if this is up Just so you guys can see maybe see what's actually happening

197
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:36,670
here June 29 2007 There was a slight rally in the stock and some general choppiness

198
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,760
as iPhone related chatter seemed to be having some effect We had to buy 400 shares

199
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:52,050
on the rally Okay, so stock went up he had to buy 400 shares Yes, so Dan,

200
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:59,800
these are unrealized P&L because he still has the position It becomes realized P

201
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,220
&L once he closes out the position.

202
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,320
Okay,

203
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,920
so on this day he lost $823 and so his total P&L so far is six thousand and the

204
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,120
margin required for this position eighty four thousand So so far for example,

205
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,960
he's up about eight percent on his position in two days in three days There was

206
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,340
practically no movement at all. So July 2nd,

207
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,590
there was practically no movement at all in the stock Volatility softened considerably

208
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:41,340
to 34 and we tried to buy some back at the bid We were not filled so implied volatility

209
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,230
came down Right, and he's betting on it coming down.

210
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,990
So that's amazing for him So what he tried to do was he tried to buy back those

211
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,690
shares for a good price meaning at the bid right at the lowest price and Why is

212
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:03,400
he doing this guys well remember when our implied versus realized spread Collapses

213
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:10,480
we want to get out of the position so originally He had a forecast of 29% and an

214
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,750
implied of 41 huge edge But now it started to shrink So because you don't have that

215
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,350
big edge anymore. You want to take some risk off the table?

216
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,470
So he that's what he tried to do but in the market We don't just get filled at the

217
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,090
price. We want we get filled at the price the market wants Well,

218
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,290
look at our little our little buddies here.

219
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,990
You're like a little chipmunk that comes and hangs it. Oh, wow Okay,

220
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:51,020
so So we try to buy back he couldn't because the market didn't want it and so what

221
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,840
happened was his P&L now is now 7,500 bucks.

222
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,080
He's almost up 10% on the position,

223
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:04,040
but he still holds it July 3rd this morning We decided to liquidate the position

224
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,750
if at all possible Implied volatility at softened we had realized a good portion

225
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:16,410
of our expected P&L and we had a few other positions in our book This case this

226
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,530
gave us an issue with lack of diversification.

227
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:25,750
We had to be more risk averse particularly with the July 4 holiday coming up Further

228
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,770
we expected volatility to soften before the holiday which would make our liquidation

229
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,720
easy Even if we had to lift the offer We bought back our shorts at the average implied

230
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,100
volatility of 29.

231
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,160
So you see what happened here guys his edge completely disappeared now forecast

232
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,930
29 implied volatility 29 No more edge. Why are you in a position?

233
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,880
There's no more edge here. So we decided let me close it out Okay,

234
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,180
and what's happened? What else is going on here?

235
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,820
Is that in his book right in his portfolio?

236
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,420
He has more short volatility positions,

237
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,180
so maybe he had let's say short Amazon Volatility. Well,

238
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,440
he doesn't just want exposure now To short like by having short Apple in short Amazon.

239
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,760
That's a correlated position So he's saying you know what?

240
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,040
I gotta take some off the table now and my edge is gone So I'm liquidating at any

241
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,560
price even if I have to lift the offer Meaning even if I have to cross the spread

242
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:36,010
I'm taking it off Because the edge is gone there's too much risk now so total P

243
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,480
&L for this trade $18,000 his expected value is 20,000.

244
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:53,040
He made 18,000 almost his full expected value that was a profit of 20% in a week

245
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,330
20% in one week.

246
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:07,170
Okay, so he made 23% So do you guys have questions about that?

247
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,350
Because now we're gonna do the post trade analysis So that was the during that was

248
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,410
the that was the during the trade now, we're gonna do post trade So,

249
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,280
let me just quickly Open up thinkorswim here so you guys can see what he actually

250
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,720
has on.

251
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,920
So this is a position that you had on Okay, it's an iron condor,

252
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,850
but he's naked So it's a straddle and when he was hedging his deltas what that means

253
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:57,040
is the stock went from 362 to let's say 350 all of a sudden now he has a Directional

254
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,310
bias, right? Just move this up.

255
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,110
He has a directional bias now.

256
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,650
He wants the stock to come up Not go down and he starts losing money if the stock

257
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:15,980
goes down. So what he did was he shorted some shares Right.

258
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,580
Let me just show you what that looks like super quick.

259
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,540
Okay,

260
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,170
so you can see now Over here right without the shares Without the shares we want

261
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,800
the stock to go up, right? We don't want it to go down Right,

262
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,370
we make $5,000 at 361 and we lose $6,000 at 333.

263
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:52,360
So we want the stock to go from 350 So we hedge our deltas and now look we don't

264
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,060
we don't care if the stock goes down or up as long as it stays Here,

265
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:06,650
so we remove that directional bias and that's what he was doing Firefox there.

266
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,890
Yeah. Oh, yeah, there it is.

267
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:16,620
So let me just answer some questions here Okay How much capital would he have needed

268
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,640
for this play So in this case,

269
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,120
he needed 84,000 to make the 20 $20,000 but you for example might only need $8,000

270
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,190
to make the $2,000. Okay,

271
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:38,860
so it's it's it's all relative When you say a profit of X percent in options is

272
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,580
that on the total equity of the option of individual trade So Dan this in this case

273
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,620
scenario it was on his Margin requirement.

274
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,940
So if it costs you $10,000 to Make this trade.

275
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,270
Let's say it's cost you $10,000 to buy Apple and then Apple goes up a thousand bucks

276
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,660
You would make 10% so it's on the margin required.

277
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,870
So let's say you buy a butterfly for 20 bucks and the butterfly goes to $25 Well,

278
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:16,370
that's 20% gain or sorry 25% gain 5 divided by the amount you have to put up which

279
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:24,320
is 20 That's gonna be 25% Okay So, okay. Let's see. What else we got here.

280
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,880
Okay, when you say okay, yeah,

281
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,460
Danny Daniel's asking What could have what could he have done if the stock started

282
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,040
to move to the upside with the stock still work as a hedge?

283
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,420
Yes So Danny see how we have to short some shares and you guys were seeing me do

284
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,330
this all the time last week See how we had to short some shares when the stock went

285
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:53,230
down Well, what if the stock went up right? What if the stock went up here now?

286
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,850
We want the stock to go down instead of up.

287
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:02,140
So what we need to do is buy the shares And now look right now.

288
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,740
We don't care where the stock goes Okay, so he's just removing his Deltas.

289
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:20,960
That's all and What was the approximate entire portfolio risk I'm Not a hundred

290
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,240
percent. I'm not a hundred percent sure here mark.

291
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,220
He doesn't really he doesn't really talk about the the whole portfolio He just talks

292
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,880
about the margin on the position.

293
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:37,610
So I'm not too sure about that Doesn't this also happen when holding an iron condor

294
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:42,090
if the stock moves down too much? Yep, exactly So with an iron condor,

295
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,590
so let me show you super quick.

296
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,390
How you doing Sean being fantastic. Yeah. Yeah, it's good Okay,

297
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:13,080
so here's our iron condor We still have that if the stock goes down here if the

298
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
stock goes up to here We want the stock to go up or sorry.

299
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,320
We want the stock to go down Not up so we can hedge our Deltas here by buying some

300
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,760
stock and there you go Right now we now we are directionless Again,

301
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,900
so same thing happens Okay,

302
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,070
so And that'll be talked about more in silver Yeah And and just so you guys know

303
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,110
like it can get costly though to hedge so you don't be hedging all the time you

304
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:50,820
Want to be hedging is as infrequent as possible How do we calculate how many more

305
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,900
stonks to buy to hedge again So you would look at your Deltas and that'll be calculated

306
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,070
for you on on your brokerage Okay,

307
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,690
but we're gonna move on to post trade analysis Okay. So in seven days,

308
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:11,280
we made 18,000 on average haircut of 76 K thus giving us a return of 24% We lost

309
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,260
money on three days But on the first of these we were incurring cost by actively

310
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,760
crossing the bid-ask spread in the options And on the second day,

311
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,040
we were happy enough to sell more on the offer at the as the implied volatility

312
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,420
slightly went more bid So this is what you guys saw in my portfolio when I was trading

313
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,080
Live for you guys, right?

314
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,640
You saw me incurring a lot of costs at the beginning to put on these positions and

315
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,290
then you usually have to hold these positions For a few days Right.

316
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:44,150
So for example, I know is finally starting to come in So this is you know,

317
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,890
we always have to keep in mind of our transaction cost we can't forget about them

318
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,410
They're so important. We don't want to be trading frequently,

319
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,870
especially in the option space when the bid-ask is not one penny If you look at

320
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,910
the stock market or the Forex or whatever,

321
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:01,030
it's gonna have a very very tight bid-ask spread But in options,

322
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,410
it gets a little bit thicker Okay.

323
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,860
So what next he says this trade was unreasonably successful meaning most of the

324
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,260
time It's not gonna work out where almost every single day.

325
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,620
He didn't have to hedge It was just it was a really good trade, right?

326
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,160
Usually it's not gonna work like that.

327
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,620
If every trade was like that everyone would be rich, right?

328
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,600
But this is an example of a good trade a good breakdown, right?

329
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:35,520
We made almost exactly what we hoped for and did it in seven days Instead of holding

330
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:46,160
that and so instead of holding the position until expiration Okay Having to hold

331
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,960
until expiration is gonna expose us to more risks, right?

332
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,120
Our gamma is gonna start to increase We're not just looking at implied volatility

333
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,590
anymore. Our gamma is increasing Okay,

334
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,890
so our decision to exit was perfectly timed as 9 a.m.

335
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,530
Eastern the next day the stock began a strong rally to close out 127 This would

336
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:14,790
have not worked out well for us implied volatility rose to 43 and we would have

337
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,540
lost money hedging our short gamma This would be inevitable regardless of our specific

338
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:27,250
hedging policy as a daily range of the size would imply volatility about 110% Okay.

339
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,170
So what he's saying is we would have lost on implied volatility and the stock movement

340
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,230
okay, however,

341
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,700
if we did hold to expiration we still would have had remained profitable and Here

342
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,040
he breaks down the trade. So on this day,

343
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,220
he lost 120 then he lost 5,000 then he made 385 7,000 etc.

344
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,740
And you can see how his P&L looked through time.

345
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,710
So he entered the position here He went up luckily. He exited right here.

346
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,720
But the next day he got smoked and then he came back up Okay,

347
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,650
so this is what it would look like So here he's gonna talk a little bit about what

348
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,290
actually was was really what was he really thinking?

349
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,470
We do these trades on the premises that implied volatility is incorrect over the

350
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,510
lifetime of the option It's the average volatility that's important or the realized

351
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,370
volatility We can afford to have a few bad days The actual close to close realized

352
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,530
volatility was 30% over the life cycle,

353
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:36,240
which was very close to his 29% forecast Okay,

354
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,010
so we were unlucky because we had a large move that took us away from our short

355
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,350
strike.

356
00:31:50,450 --> 00:32:01,200
So meaning Here's his short strike Okay right here the 362 he had a large move That

357
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,110
took him down here Right.

358
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,510
So we had to hedge the position if he stayed right in here and time for the past

359
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,250
right as time passes He makes money, right?

360
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,970
So that's why guys when he said there was no there was no hedging the stock didn't

361
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:29,090
move All he did was Collect data the purple line moved up a bit Okay,

362
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:38,910
then he talks about this We should never get stopped out of a trade just because

363
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,730
we have lost money.

364
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:46,480
We exit trades if we no longer like them Losing money while deeply unpleasant should

365
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,900
never be the sole React should never be the the criterion for exiting Right just

366
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,300
because you're losing money doesn't mean you exit the trade the stock the trade

367
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,090
could keep going against you but if your initial idea is still intact keep the trade

368
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:09,470
on right a Basic cliche is always have a stop but this is overly simplistic and

369
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,580
it doesn't take into account the dynamics of the trade This is one thing I don't

370
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,640
agree with you is that I think we should have a ultimate stop where we say we are

371
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,560
We are wrong Okay,

372
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,180
we expect high volatility be transient So stopping ourselves out after every high

373
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,840
volatility burst is not a good idea Right if we think implied volatility is high

374
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,500
at 40 and it goes up to 43. Well, it still looks good to us Right.

375
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:45,700
So we need to we do understand that so instead of a stop based purely on P&L Which

376
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,460
I agree with we have a plan based on our edge evaluation and our initial trade size

377
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,870
Trades going bad shouldn't be too painful if they are kept small enough Okay,

378
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,390
so just quickly summary an old trading adage is to plan the trade trade the plan

379
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,940
Look for situations where implied volatility differs significantly from your forecast

380
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:14,220
both for Pacific stock and in context of the market Evaluate the fundamentals that

381
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,530
causing this this spread Do your research? Yeah, do your research?

382
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:24,000
execute the trade appropriate size and hedge it properly and then hold until your

383
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,820
your edge is either realized or your volatility forecast changes and Then continually

384
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,620
evaluate risk in context of your overall portfolio If you sell Apple and you sell

385
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,480
Amazon and you sell Microsoft,

386
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,440
you probably all you have one big trade You don't have three different trades.

387
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,840
So that is the breakdown Okay,

388
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,520
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually ask you guys questions now to see

389
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,270
how much you absorbed So you want you want to send that out?

390
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:03,930
Yeah so That's a question from while ago We actually instead koa if you if you still

391
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,090
have a question about how we forecasted the vol Just ask it again because we answered

392
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,990
that when Danny asked it Yeah,

393
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,730
so let us know if you have any more questions about that But for now,

394
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,890
we're gonna hop right into our little test here.

395
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:24,870
So just we have three questions Question one run for one minute. Good luck.

396
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,690
Okay. Let me see how many guys we haven't alive today.

397
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,160
We'll give another 30 seconds Okay,

398
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,010
15 we got 15 so I'm gonna wait for for you guys to get in here Wait for a couple

399
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:08,050
more Come on guys get him in.

400
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,090
I mean we got we got you got test your knowledge here.

401
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,740
Give that one more second.

402
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,090
Okay?

403
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:30,040
I press and pull right Okay Okay, so most of you guys got it, right?

404
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,000
Fantastic IV was greater than forecast, right?

405
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,920
He said the implied volatility was 41.

406
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,080
The forecast was 29 And he understood why the trade why it was bid Because everyone

407
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,760
was looking at the stock it had a catalyst coming up and everyone was being directional

408
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
It was pushed on the news.

409
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,660
He said right and that this was in 2007 So nowadays we are gonna say, you know,

410
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,660
it's pushed on the stock boards Cool raise his hand Yeah,

411
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,960
he said where's the test?

412
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,580
So it should be popping up on your screen as a part of the zoom Are you are you

413
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,450
on mobile? Maybe it may not pop up on mobile Okay. Yeah,

414
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:15,530
so it's it's showing up for desktop users I'm not a hundred percent sure where you

415
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,250
would find the pole on mobile Try clicking around the screen.

416
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,400
It's a it's a pole that we've launched Okay, okay.

417
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
There's only a couple questions call.

418
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,540
I wouldn't worry about it for this one It's only three questions for the next round

419
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,260
do it for the for the next life. Okay, stop sharing, right?

420
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:43,050
Yeah All right pole number two Another 60 seconds and meet this for a second.

421
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,050
See if our little buddy will come.

422
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:13,460
Oh, we can't see that So what the full question? That's okay Okay,

423
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,020
we got eight answers waiting for a few more guys nine ten eleven. Okay,

424
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,900
twelve perfect Okay, sweet. So Almost all of you guys got it, right?

425
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,090
Share results. Okay, so pretty straightforward, right?

426
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,700
He understood why why ball was expensive He planned his risk management and he estimated

427
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,500
expected value.

428
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,950
So there there's nothing really to be There's nothing really to be you know Shaken

429
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,470
up about what now we enter remember we want to take psychology out of trading as

430
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,310
much as we can because we're not good At psychology. No one is right.

431
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,340
Maybe maybe some people are I wouldn't I shouldn't say that Why go the hard route?

432
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,620
Plan everything out before you enter the position If something wild happens you

433
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,920
are you knew that this could this could happen if it does happen.

434
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,450
I'm out Right,

435
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,110
so you come in here knowing everything about how you think this trade is gonna break

436
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:16,410
down all possible scenarios The stock gapping up 30% What do you do then?

437
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:23,580
Right? You need to think about these things before you enter the trade Okay,

438
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,580
and because of that he was confident going into the trade and now all of a sudden

439
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:34,180
psychology is nothing It's something but all of a sudden it's removed a lot.

440
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,120
You're not you're not you're not guessing. Oh, maybe it's gonna come back Oh,

441
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,480
you know, maybe it's not gonna come back.

442
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,440
It's like no I pre-planned this am I being greedy if I stay in? Yeah,

443
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,400
you know am I being fearful if I get out you don't have questions like that anymore

444
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,450
exact next question Okay,

445
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,790
or last question and then I'm gonna go in the terminal super quick and show you

446
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,770
guys some of the features that we just Looked at here.

447
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,590
All right. Good luck guys. I think this one's let's see Okay, yeah,

448
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,770
this is this is a good one,

449
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:39,230
okay a few more of you guys to come in waiting on two more,

450
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,800
all right,

451
00:40:51,100 --> 00:41:00,330
and We're gonna end the poll right there So it wasn't that he had a directional

452
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,510
view on Apple instead It was that he didn't have a directional view on Apple.

453
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,510
So we wanted to remove that exposure Right when we're looking here,

454
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,010
for example,

455
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:19,320
I'm think or swim the stock went down here Let's say to 349 all of a sudden he has

456
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,980
directional exposure He wants the stock to go back up and he didn't want that So

457
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,700
he decided to trade the shares to get rid of that exposure So I'm glad I'm glad

458
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,380
Almost all of you got it,

459
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,470
right but keep that in mind With options we have the beauty of or in trading not

460
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,350
just an option with the beauty of Getting exposure to the risk we want and removing

461
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:44,890
the exposure.

462
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,810
We don't want and that's what he did He didn't want directional exposure.

463
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:57,670
So he removed it Okay So now I'm just gonna quickly jump into the predicting alpha

464
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:03,770
terminal if you guys have any questions raise your hand Or drop them in the comment

465
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,330
box drop them in the comment box.

466
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:11,980
We're gonna quickly go over this What info did he need to calculate that 20k expected

467
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
profit? Yep.

468
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:22,940
So all he needed was his implied volatility and His forecast of volatility once

469
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:32,670
you do that all you do is so it's right here so Here's his implied Okay,

470
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:39,400
his forecast was 29 and then he has to multiply it by this is something in silver

471
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,860
So if you're you know, if you're bronze, don't worry too much about this.

472
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,570
He multiplies it by his Vega exposure Okay,

473
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,050
so how much exposure he has to Vega?

474
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,870
So for example on this trade right on this Apple trade,

475
00:42:50,950 --> 00:43:05,320
let's go back to To today on this Apple trade we have $850 of short Vega exposure.

476
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,480
Okay,

477
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:14,350
so in our in that case we would do 850 times the difference So that's how he came

478
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:23,490
up with that It's like I noticed yeah,

479
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:37,340
I got it after we changed that password I sat there for so long trying to remember

480
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,140
what it was Really? Yeah, I couldn't remember it, but he figured it out. Yeah.

481
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,480
Yeah. Okay,

482
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:50,490
so a couple things here guys first thing is for the forecast of volatility We do

483
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,510
something very similar to what you did where we take a bunch of different factors

484
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,010
different models We add them up.

485
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,910
We take the average of them and then that comes out right over here so for Apple,

486
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,410
for example,

487
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:07,860
our forecast is thirty two point five eight and The implied is thirty three if this

488
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,650
was let's say 42 we could be selling volatility Okay,

489
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:20,020
then the other thing is you can see Historically how much Volatility Apple's hadn't

490
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:27,550
passed just like you did right where he showed He showed the volatility of one year.

491
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,420
Well,

492
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,960
we did the we have something very similar on the on the terminal What has the historical

493
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,180
volatility been a year from now a year ago, right?

494
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,620
So You know if so right now you can see implied volatility as high as 86 Imagine

495
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:51,900
or sorry realized volatility is 86 Imagine implied volatility was 300 would that

496
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,030
make sense? No, so we would sell options there. So this is the historical Okay,

497
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,210
so these are the few features that you know,

498
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,090
you used in his analysis that we actually have in the terminal.

499
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:15,520
Okay, so Daniel said if we wanted to do a quick forecast from the TOS platform,

500
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,300
how could we do that? Do you mean forecast of volatility? Yeah,

501
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,460
I think that's what he's talking about. Okay,

502
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:35,730
so In that case you would use Yeah In that case you would use

503
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:44,880
this Okay, historical volatility right there. Now, that's the close to close,

504
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,400
right? That's one of the forecasts the issue with this is it's not great Right.

505
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,940
This is not the greatest model ever. And in fact, it's it's very naive.

506
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,420
So you would say for example The implied vault the historical volatility of Apple

507
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,560
has been 33% in the past Meaning it's probably gonna be 33% in the future.

508
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:15,210
Now that is very naive So I wouldn't be too keen on using Just this alone You got

509
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,290
a good question from Chegg's.

510
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,130
So he said why doesn't the market calculate volatility like we do?

511
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,070
What do they do differently that causes the mispricing? Okay,

512
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,530
so first off Chiggs There are people that do exactly what we do right you did it

513
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,300
for example Right.

514
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,800
There are other guys that I've learned from that do the same thing that we do as

515
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,570
well The problem is and also what you mentioned is that a lot of option traders

516
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:42,310
don't price volatility They don't trade volatility Right.

517
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,830
How many times do you see people say I own Apple?

518
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:50,590
So I'm gonna buy some puts to hedge They don't care what the price is or I own Apple

519
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,790
So I'm gonna sell some calls to get a covered call and get some income They don't

520
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,960
care about the price of those calls Right,

521
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,960
or I'm gonna buy an Apple call pre earnings because I think Apple is going up After

522
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,590
earnings they don't care about the price of the call again, right?

523
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,870
So for that reason the market is not looking at the world through implied volatility

524
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,400
But we are looking at the world through implied volatility.

525
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,380
That's all that's only that's the only difference most of the world is looking at

526
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:24,230
the is looking at the market through a directional bias and For that reason we can

527
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:29,890
find edge in Volatility because there are the world of volatility is much smaller

528
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,700
So I hope that answers that question there What they do people do price it like

529
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:45,800
we do and they some people even use more advanced techniques Can we do any other

530
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,880
questions? I think that was a good little walkthrough. I you know,

531
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,700
I hope you guys There was I think it was a Q&A or was that that was it?

532
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,900
We finished it wasn't there I think there's one up here. Let me see.

533
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,070
I think that's the old one. Okay.

534
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:04,490
Yeah Mark says I was away for a bit But what are your thoughts on not Delta hedging

535
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,410
but instead using the parameters of the risk profile to define your risk?

536
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,990
Instead of Delta hedging. Yep. Yep, Mark. I Think that's you know,

537
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:22,990
because Delta hedging is expensive and obviously you know that So if you're not

538
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:27,810
going to Delta hedge Then you would you'd probably have a hard stop somewhere,

539
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:33,280
right? Like if the stock goes, you know, the stock goes Ten percent down.

540
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,530
I have to close out my position But yeah,

541
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:42,010
I mean There's nothing wrong with not Delta hedging as like I said,

542
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:48,460
it is pretty expensive So you would say for example Then you also have a directional

543
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,220
view though, right Mark.

544
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,460
So like let's say stock goes down to 380 all of a sudden You are long you you you

545
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,450
are You are short shares So,

546
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,310
you know you at that point you have to say well if I'm not if I'm if I'm bullish

547
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:06,820
on Apple You probably don't want to be in this position anymore.

548
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,400
So I Know I'm not sure. Did I answer that question mark?

549
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:32,110
Yeah Okay, so the only time Honestly mark, I actually I probably don't do it.

550
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:37,400
I like I'm probably the worst directional trader you're ever gonna meet Like for

551
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,150
example our Spotify trade I Close it out. Literally.

552
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,750
I bought it at the top close it at the bottom and it rallied all the way back up

553
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,250
We would have made 15,000 bucks just on that butterfly.

554
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,110
It pinned to our short strike a day later a day later.

555
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,830
Unbelievable So I'm honestly I'll be straight up with you.

556
00:49:54,850 --> 00:50:00,370
I'm not the grace Directional trader so as soon as I get too much Delta,

557
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:05,760
I'm gonna close it out But I know there are definitely people that do right but

558
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,760
then but then what you're really trading is instead of the implied versus realized

559
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,640
Spread you're you're trading the terminal distribution.

560
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,740
What is what is the stock today versus where it's gonna be in the future,

561
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,740
right?

562
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,500
You're at you're trading the end point So if you think for example Apple is gonna

563
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,440
is in support and resistance right now Do you think it's gonna stay within that

564
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:25,740
range?

565
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:33,180
Then you probably swing Delta hedge you just hold this position But you know,

566
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,820
I'm sure you're probably much better directional trader than I am mark So I wouldn't

567
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,900
I wouldn't be taking advice from me in that sense.

568
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:45,910
So if there's no more questions,

569
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,070
we're gonna wrap this up We're gonna go into the after dark for 15 minutes.

570
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,170
Yeah, we'll go hang out Yeah,

571
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,650
see if you guys want a couple new guys tune in here really happy to see you here

572
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,570
If you look in the discord, we have a category called after dark.

573
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,530
It has a text channel and a voice channel We're just gonna pop in there hang out

574
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:05,860
for a bit if you guys have any more questions for us Marco said do you ever trade

575
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:12,800
direction? I do trade direction, but it's not in the sense of Outright Delta.

576
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,860
So Delta just means direction and we're gonna cover all this in I think we're doing

577
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,580
a bronzer. No,

578
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:26,310
it's in silver Yeah So I don't usually take outright directional bets Because like

579
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:26,690
I said,

580
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,000
I don't have an edge in it and it's not that I don't have it like an edge in it

581
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,920
It's also the fact that I haven't spent the time I've seen what it takes to be a

582
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,900
profitable directional trader and It's pretty mind-blowing I've seen some of the

583
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,960
guys who work at some big funds that are doing some very cool data science stuff

584
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,090
with direction and It's definitely not an easy game.

585
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,850
I think there's a lot more money to be made in the vol space And so for that reason

586
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,040
I tried to remain directionless However,

587
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,960
there are some times where I do pack on some Delta Yeah,

588
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,390
so for example in the unbalanced flies on unbalanced fly exactly Danny had a question

589
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,470
that we should address Yeah, Mark,

590
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,530
so you like you like we know each other pretty well now and like, you know,

591
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,270
I do trade one three two flies they are they do have direction,

592
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:25,410
but They're also very sensitive to The skew right so we get like these really nice

593
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,130
risk reward trades and they're usually more of a risk reward trade than a directional

594
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:35,480
trade Yeah, I do. I do trade directional. Sometimes I try to find a small edge,

595
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,560
especially around earnings events But even then it's I'm definitely not the best

596
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,800
directional trader Danny had a question about the what did we mean by the risk parameter

597
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,570
in the brokerage? So like we're talking about this Okay, right.

598
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,030
So you just want to say like, what do you mean by risk brokerage? Okay.

599
00:52:55,090 --> 00:53:01,180
So so what Mark was saying is Do you ever just put on this trade and then don't

600
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,040
Delta hedge and instead have like a risk parameter where you know If the stock goes

601
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,340
below a certain threshold, you're out of the position, right?

602
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,200
Just like what we do in iron condors,

603
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:17,300
right when you guys are trading iron condors for bronze so Yeah,

604
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,380
that's exactly what he's talking about. But for me,

605
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,110
I usually like to hedge my deltas And yeah,

606
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,890
so that'll be in silver by the way for all this is a bronze live. Yeah,

607
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:30,630
we got into some silver concepts Yeah, we did. I think it was good. Yeah Yeah,

608
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:37,200
so You can have a hard stop right where if it touches the wing we're out So I will

609
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,440
do that I will do that sometimes Because Delta hedging is pretty expensive.

610
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:50,840
But most of the time I do like to hedge my deltas Okay, guys,

611
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,540
so that's the life that's the life we're gonna end it there and we'll see you in

612
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:01,470
the after dark for a bit Awesome. Peace out Yeah,

613
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,690
exactly It's funny because like because you didn't sinclair just basically said

614
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,940
like, you know, don't don't don't do But I think they're I think you know,

615
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,800
it's good to have a hard stop When you're wrong,

616
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,730
right know when you're wrong and and put it put it in there. Okay guys,

617
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:29,330
I'll talk to you in a bit Thanks mark Yeah,
