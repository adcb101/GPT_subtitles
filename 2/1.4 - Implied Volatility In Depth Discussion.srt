1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,300
Why do we look at the world in implied volatilities when we're option traders?

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,960
Why do we do that? Why do we not look at it through prices?

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,820
Okay. Why is it that as an option trader, you guys come in here,

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,240
a lot of the new guys come in here and right off the bat,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,640
they have to start looking at the world through this implied volatility lens.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,560
You know, why are we doing this? Wouldn't it make more sense to just use price?

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,990
What do you guys think?

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,340
I think Neil fell asleep, man. He's either freaking out or he fell asleep. No,

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,260
he just doesn't know the answer.

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,340
Okay,

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,010
so what do you guys think? Wow, no answer. All right, go for it. Okay,

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,150
I'm gonna have to share my screen and we're gonna jump into it.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,980
Is he asleep or alone or with someone? No, no, he's asleep. It's Neil, man.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,900
It's with someone.

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,630
Okay, so here we're gonna go to an option price calculator, okay?

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,950
And I want you guys to think about this for a second, okay? Neil,

17
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,830
so the question is,

18
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,410
why do we look at the world through implied volatilities and not price?

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,160
So I want you guys to imagine this, okay? So first off, 99% of retail traders,

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,240
99% of traders look at the world through price in terms of options.

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,320
The professionals always look at it through implied volatility.

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,960
Why is that the case?

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,260
Okay, so imagine we're looking at... Actually,

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,820
let me pull up thinkorswim as well. Okay,

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,780
imagine we're looking at a stock that's trading for 100 bucks.

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,320
It's trading at $100 and we're looking at the 105 strike call option.

27
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,450
Now, if that 105 strike call option was $3 or $2 or $8,

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,560
would we be able to make decisions off of that?

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,470
What do you guys think? While I sign in here,

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,710
let me know what you guys are thinking.

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,120
Because I feel like even with some of the guys here, Kyle, Neil, Steve,

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
I feel like I still have to ingrain this in your heads.

33
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,380
Right, Renato? We can't just... We can't make a decision.

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,450
If I'm looking at Apple, okay? And Apple's trading right now at $115.

35
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,140
And I look at this call option for 120 and it's going for $3 and 70 cents.

36
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,600
What does that mean? Right, Sean always says, learn how to price your asset.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,740
Is it cheap or expensive? Is it fair value? Do you know,

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,820
right? We can't gain any information from $3 and 70 cents.

39
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,410
Do you want to say something? No, keep going. Okay,

40
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,190
so now let's see why we want to look at it through implied volatility lens.

41
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,360
Well, the first thing we need to think about is, how are these options created?

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,920
How are they replicated, right? How can we actually value this asset?

43
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,090
And the way we can value this asset is through volatility. Okay,

44
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,730
options are a volatility product. Let's go into option calculator here, okay?

45
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,000
Stocks trading at 100. We look at the 105 strike call.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,040
Days until expiration is 30.

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Okay, dividend interest rates are zero and implied volatility is 30%. Well,

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,620
that implied volatility level. Okay,

49
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,040
so the implied volatility meaning what the market is expecting to happen corresponds

50
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,400
to $1.56 call option.

51
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,430
Okay, so now you're probably thinking, well, Jordan,

52
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,440
what the hell does volatility of 30 mean to us? Right,

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,140
it doesn't mean anything either. Well, we can actually see,

54
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,400
we can actually graph volatility through time, right? And we can see, well,

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,920
how has this thing moved, right? Now we're being able to see,

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,620
is this cheap or is this expensive, right? If we look at,

57
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,750
let's take a look here. Let's see how we can take a look.

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,120
So we're looking at Apple, let's say.

59
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,370
And what I'm going to graph is the historical implied volatility. Okay,

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,710
just by itself.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,780
I'm going to expand it. Yeah, so here's the implied volatility for Apple.

62
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,610
Well, now let me ask you guys this question, okay?

63
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,550
So first I'm going to ask you this.

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
So I'm going to graph, actually,

65
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,220
I'm going to graph this option.

66
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:48,250
Okay, so this is the, what was this? This is the November 20th contract. Okay,

67
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,010
November 20th contract. At the money call. Just out of the, well,

68
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,270
right now it's out of the money. Okay,

69
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,470
so let me actually go a little bit longer out here, guys.

70
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,230
I can only go back five days, it looks like. Okay,

71
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,130
let me ask you guys this question right now. Is this price,

72
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,030
so right now it's trading at $2.40. Is this cheap or expensive?

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,230
What do you guys think? It's trading for $2.40. Is it cheap or expensive?

74
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,530
Okay, here it is right here.

75
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,560
Okay, and this is what it's been trading at the last five days.

76
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,110
Cheap or expensive?

77
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,280
Koaw is saying cheap. How come? Why Koaw? Marco's saying it depends.

78
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,420
I like that answer better. Kyle's saying, I don't know. Right?

79
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,740
I like that answer too. Yeah, we really don't know.

80
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,800
We really don't know because this option, for example,

81
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,850
maybe it was at the money here and now it's out of the money. Right, well,

82
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,950
obviously it's going to go down,

83
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,450
but that has nothing to do with the stock price. Well,

84
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,610
it has nothing to do with the stock price, but it has nothing to do with,

85
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,050
right, it's...

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,920
It has nothing to do with fair value. Right, it was at a different price here.

87
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,660
The,

88
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,840
let's say Apple over here was trading at 120 and now Apple's trading at 115 over

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,020
here. Well, obviously this call option is going to go down,

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,320
but that means we have to have a view on the price, not on the option.

91
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,690
Right? On the price of the stock, on the price of the underlying. Now,

92
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,890
let's take a look at implied vol, okay?

93
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,160
Actually, we'll look at SLV because that one, oh shit.

94
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,460
It's so fucking funny, man. Always happens. Should've held it.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,170
Always happens to me, man. Okay. Okay, guys, I swear to God, these things,

96
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,150
I don't know who draws these, okay? I swear to God, they're not me.

97
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,240
Must be Chris. Chris must be taking over my computer. Okay, so we can see here,

98
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,260
right, guys? Let's take a look. Time frame set up.

99
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,220
You pinned up our strike too, man. I know, right? Should've held it, man.

100
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,840
Isn't that crazy?

101
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:36,660
And just to keep you guys in the loop, back in, right, back in July,

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,960
Sean and I were selling the 23s straddles on silver, November expiration.

103
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,660
And what do you know, guys? Pins to our strike, okay? Not the first time.

104
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,900
Won't be the last time. What else do you know, guys?

105
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,640
We fucking sold it like a month ago. Yeah, we sold it on the first breakdown.

106
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,260
Okay, so we can look at this graph right here, okay?

107
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,800
Without even doing any data statistical analysis,

108
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,780
we can look at this graph here and be like, okay,

109
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,200
this is expensive relative to history.

110
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Okay, relative to history,

111
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,700
this implied volatility is probably extremely expensive and is almost certainly

112
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,500
gonna go down in the future, right, which it did. Now,

113
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,720
obviously timing it perfectly is difficult, right? So for example,

114
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,840
we might've been, and we were, right,

115
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:35,380
we were selling vol here and it went all the way up to here, right? But,

116
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,080
you know,

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,800
we were able to manage the position and eventually it turned out to be a profitable

118
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
trade, right? Came all the way back down and then we exited around here.

119
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,260
Now, the whole purpose of this is, this is how we can view options, okay?

120
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,540
And it's not just the level of implied volatility, okay?

121
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,320
That's the most important thing as well, okay?

122
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
It's not just the level of implied volatility,

123
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,870
it's also for the surrounding options. And what do I mean by that?

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,110
Well, we look at Apple here and I wanna compare,

125
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,740
let's say the 120 call option and the 125 call option. Well,

126
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,020
the 120 call option is $4 and 5 cents and the 125 call option is $2 and 50 cents.

127
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,820
So why don't I just sell a whole bunch of these 120s and buy a whole bunch of the

128
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:36,400
125s, right? We have to be able to compare these options locally, okay?

129
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:43,120
So there's a globally and there's also locally and this is on a local plane here,

130
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,510
okay? So we can see, okay, well,

131
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:51,570
this option is trading for 47 and a half percent and this option is trading for

132
00:10:51,570 --> 00:11:01,720
47.13%. Now, what if this option here was trading for, let's say $1, okay?

133
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,350
So right now it's trading for $1.80. Imagine it was trading for a buck. Well,

134
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,650
we wouldn't be able to tell if it's expensive or cheap but we can because we use

135
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,210
implied volatilities. This would be 47 and a half and this would be 35,

136
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,760
right?

137
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,060
So we could do something now where we could buy this at 35% and sell these at 47%,

138
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,560
right, and make money.

139
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,730
And that is why using implied volatilities and looking at the world through implied

140
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,210
volatility is crucial in option trading and why you won't see market makers or professional

141
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,030
option traders quoting in price. They'll always quote in implied vol, right?

142
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,250
And I'm gonna try and explain it a little deeper here as well or just in a little

143
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,350
bit more of a simple way maybe.

144
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,120
You make money on an option, right? Let's say you were to buy a call,

145
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,760
not just when the stock goes up,

146
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,840
but when it goes up within a given timeframe past a certain point, right?

147
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,520
Remember the characteristics of what really an option is made up of, right?

148
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,780
You need to have a view on how quickly it's going to move as well, right?

149
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,140
And what we know volatility means is it's the size and speed of these moves,

150
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,630
right? It's almost like you can use,

151
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,350
similar to the way we use volatile in other words,

152
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,510
like Jordan has a great example with a drunk guy walking down the street,

153
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:30,990
right?

154
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:39,930
If we were trying to measure how drunk this person was just by asking him how many

155
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,530
beers he had,

156
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,270
we might not get a great read because who knows it might be a seasoned alcoholic.

157
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,650
He's had seven beers, but that's just a typical Tuesday afternoon for him.

158
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,730
He hasn't even got to the evening yet or maybe it's someone who's never drank before

159
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,750
and seven beers should put them in the hospital, right?

160
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,750
So we can't really judge it like that.

161
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,170
But what we could maybe look at is we could watch this person walk and see how they

162
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,990
stumble, right?

163
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:16,000
Maybe if this is the case, if this is the sidewalk, right? And we'll say,

164
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,270
this is the road, there's like cars driving here now.

165
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,690
Maybe the person walks like this,

166
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,190
right?

167
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,470
Maybe he's walking like this,

168
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,890
which he's got a good buzz going or maybe he walks like this.

169
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,540
Maybe he's pretty sober, who knows how many beers he had,

170
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,820
maybe he's pretty sober or maybe he's walking like this.

171
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,600
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but that's Neil after one beer.

172
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,720
That's Neil.

173
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,710
That's Neil, yeah.

174
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,870
But you guys get what I'm saying, right?

175
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,290
So volatility can help us explain things that price cannot, right?

176
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,190
Because at the end of the day, the option is not just about where it moves to,

177
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,170
it's about how quickly it's moving as well, right?

178
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,070
Volatility is the size of these moves.

179
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,810
And the implied volatility is what is the market saying those moves are going to

180
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,930
be? Now, if we looked at an option on Apple versus an option on Amazon,

181
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,050
both of them at the money, they're going to be drastically different prices,

182
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,810
right? Imagine the option on a penny stock versus the option on $2,000 Amazon,

183
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,350
right? The Amazon option might be like a few hundred bucks,

184
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,570
whereas the penny stock one is 10 cents.

185
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,590
Does that make the penny stock one cheap?

186
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,970
How are we supposed to compare these things and be like,

187
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,130
what are these options telling us about these different stocks?

188
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,770
The only way that we can do it is by having an apples to apples comparison to them.

189
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,990
And that's why we can use something like this, like volatility, right?

190
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,650
What if we looked at the volatility measures for each of them and we see that,

191
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,550
you know, sure the Amazon one, right?

192
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:09,380
Is maybe let's say $200 and the penny stock one is 50 cents.

193
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,020
But in terms of implied volatility,

194
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,820
maybe the Amazon one is saying this and the penny stock one is saying this.

195
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,900
All of a sudden we see that this penny stock one is telling us that the market thinks

196
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,420
this thing is going to move like crazy.

197
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,920
Whereas the Amazon one is telling us that it's actually implying that Amazon isn't

198
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,760
going to move much in the future, right?

199
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,220
Now you can see how once we move it to implied volatilities,

200
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,410
we can start looking at things relative to one another and start to make judgments

201
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,690
about what would need to happen in the future in order for this to be a profitable

202
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,870
or unprofitable trade if we bought or sold, right?

203
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,670
In order to help us make a better decision about what's this thing worth,

204
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,820
right? You know, anything you want to add there? Nope. I think it allows,

205
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,440
implied volatility allows us to look at the world on the same playing field,

206
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,340
right? Everything is lined up. Exactly. Right? Of course,

207
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,700
an Amazon call is going to be $50 and, you know,

208
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,000
a small cap stock is going to be or a small price stock is going to be $2.

209
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,570
You can't say this $2 one is cheaper than the $50 Amazon.

210
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,630
A lot of people actually look at the world like that, right?

211
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,590
We have to always look at implied vol,

212
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,200
okay? And Neil, do you actually want to share your story there?

213
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,260
I can't remember. Like, did you roll down the hill and then the goat hit you?

214
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,140
Is that how it worked? The goat nailed you with the picture up with its horns?

215
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,190
Okay. Anyway, so... And guys, at the end, after the live is done,

216
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,190
I'm going to go over some implied correlation stuff super quick.

217
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,630
I just realized I have Chris Cidio up here. I really got to stop. But anyways,

218
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,510
we... I thought we talked about this, man. Yeah,

219
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,250
we can go over the implied correlation post he just tweeted about for the more advanced

220
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:10,590
guys. Okay. So stocks trading at $100, $105 call price, okay?

221
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,470
Days until expiration, $30. Volatility, $30. Now,

222
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,390
look what happens when we change the price of implied volatility.

223
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,050
When we change implied volatility, okay?

224
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,730
So when we go from $30 to let's say $40,

225
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:34,260
the call option is going to go from $1.56 to $2.60. So if we think that today,

226
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,800
fair value or volatility in the future is going to be 40%,

227
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,080
that call option should be worth $2.60 today.

228
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,810
But because the market is saying it's only going to move $30, it's only $1.56,

229
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,780
right?

230
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,360
By having our own forecast of what volatility will look like in the future,

231
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,370
we can now say, is this cheap or expensive? And we can do this for any option.

232
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Because it's no longer about the price of the option,

233
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,620
it's about what that option has baked into it.

234
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,360
And the measure we can use that's baked into the option to compare them all is implied

235
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,780
volatility.

236
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,450
Yeah, I know. Good thing you're going to the gym, man,

237
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,130
or you probably wouldn't be on the slide right now.

238
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,170
That goat would have gone through you, man. Yeah.

239
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,030
So that is why we look at implied volatility, okay? Now, the next thing is,

240
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,510
well, how do we find these opportunities?

241
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,750
Where would we find opportunities where options are going to be over or underpriced?

242
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,320
So the way you want to think about it is, this is actually coming off of,

243
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,900
I've always had this idea, but I think Yoon said a lot nicer.

244
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,920
You can take advantage, for example, of risk premiums, right?

245
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,160
We always talk about this. Where is the market?

246
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,660
Where are people not willing to go? Right? So for example,

247
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,620
people don't want down and out put exposure.

248
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,260
And I guess before we hop into that, like something that should be said is,

249
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
it's not like you're just going to look at an option chain and it's going to be

250
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,380
like, all of them are 40 implied vol,

251
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,360
and you'll just see one that's like 20 implied vol. You know, the market,

252
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,940
something that people have to always keep in mind is,

253
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,820
the market is not perfectly efficient, but it's damn good, right?

254
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,240
So there will usually be like a reasonable explanation for why something would be

255
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,000
expensive or cheap. Now there's times where it's not. And when we see those,

256
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,890
we take advantage of all of them, right? Like BCLI, right?

257
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,510
We were in this trade right now, where you want to pull it up.

258
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,640
That's a good example. Right? Go through that. Because like, look guys,

259
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
here's the implied vol. The stock's a lot less liquid, okay? Look at this.

260
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,780
This is going for 185% and this is going for 262%, right?

261
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,510
Now a naive person might come in here and be like, arbitrage opportunity. Well,

262
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,810
the reality is this brokerage here is not giving you fair,

263
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,550
it's not quoting you the fair price, right?

264
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,810
They're using mid as an implied vol fair value.

265
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,680
So you might come in here and say, okay,

266
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,640
I'm going to sell a boatload of these and buy a boatload of these, right?

267
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,480
You might do, let's say a ratio spread here, right? Let's see,

268
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,380
1250 and what was it? 1750,

269
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,140
right? You might come in here and say, well, Jordan,

270
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm going to sell a bunch of these, right? I'm going to sell vol at 260.

271
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm going to buy vol at 185 and it looks great,

272
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,240
right? Look at this guys, it looks fantastic. You know, we're going to,

273
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,460
we basically, we get to, we're not going to lose money below,

274
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,470
if we hold to expiration below 24 bucks, right? And on the downside,

275
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,270
we're obviously going to make, you know, the 1050 bucks.

276
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,890
The difference more or less. And you might say, okay, well, you know,

277
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,890
if this was priced, for example, so you guys can see right here, right?

278
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's price this out. So here, 185 implied vol, okay?

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,160
This one looks pretty liquid. You can see the bid ask spreads pretty tight,

280
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,300
not super tight, but pretty tight, okay? But look at this one over here.

281
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,490
What if this was priced at 185 vol? How much should this be worth?

282
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,420
So right now, for example, the brokerage is quoting us a mid of $1.15, okay?

283
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,320
So let's go to our option calculator super quick.

284
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,690
Stock is trading at $10 and 20 cents.

285
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:55,520
And we're looking at the 1750 call is until expiration 25 and volatility 185,

286
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,300
okay?

287
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,590
So this option would go from $1.15 to 42 cents. This is the real fair value,

288
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:12,470
right? The real fair value is 42 cents, not $1.15, right? If it was $1.15,

289
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,330
we'd want to sell these as much as possible.

290
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,510
And the only way we were able to do this is through the lens of implied volatility,

291
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,790
not through the lens of the price,

292
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,360
okay?

293
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,930
Look at this one, right? This one's the mid here is $2.50.

294
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,660
It's trading at 450% implied vol. You know,

295
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,500
someone might come in here and be like, this is awesome. This is an awesome,

296
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,940
you know, an awesome sell. I'm going to get this for $2.50.

297
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,700
They start buying these, right? They start accumulating these at 185.

298
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,930
Then they come and start selling these and they realize I can't get this for $2

299
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:58,520
.50, right? Because they weren't looking at the lens of implied vol, right?

300
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,120
This is an arbitrage opportunity, right? Look at this, guys.

301
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:09,280
We can sell this for $2.50 and we can buy this for $1.20.

302
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,980
Arbitrage. There's nowhere on this graph where we lose money, okay?

303
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,020
And that is why this will never happen, right? You know,

304
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,300
this exact thing will never happen. I've never seen it.

305
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,840
You guys probably won't ever see it. Who knows?

306
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,550
But maybe leave a resting order. Some new book will come in and hit you, right?

307
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,250
So, you know, these are,

308
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,130
if we don't look at the world through implied volatility and we only look at price,

309
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,870
because I've seen a lot of the guys in the group, for example, be like, hey,

310
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,390
how can I lose money on this trade?

311
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,390
Because they were looking at it through price.

312
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,740
If you're looking at through implied vol,

313
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,850
you'll realize that the world's a lot different.

314
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,170
And that's how the professionals look at this game.

315
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,240
Kyle, down and out means, so if we're looking at the option chain, okay?

316
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,440
We're down. So we go down in strikes and we're out in time.

317
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,440
So down and out might be, let's say, a 200-day Delta 5 or Delta 10 put,

318
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,370
okay? Yeah, out in time, way out of the mind. Yeah, that's a down and out.

319
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,410
Basically betting on this thing going to zero in the long run.

320
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,810
Marcos is asking if we ever look at volume. We don't look at volume.

321
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,870
In the sense that a lot of other people do. Yeah, you know,

322
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:37,570
and that being said, Marcos, you know, you've been with us for a while now.

323
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,990
You know that we don't know everything.

324
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,490
And so I've heard of stories where guys would, you know,

325
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:48,090
find these small cap stocks. They have a huge print,

326
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:54,340
an aggressive print on the ask for, you know, let's say 5,000 contracts.

327
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,390
And you can tag along with those, right?

328
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,870
And that's actually a retail strategy that big institutions can't do.

329
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,330
That being said, I think you need to do a lot more.

330
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,160
It's a lot harder to do that than said.

331
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,320
Yeah, because now you're in the queue.

332
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,940
Ko is saying 5 cents versus $5. Did I just say something about that? No,

333
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,900
he's just looking at this.

334
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,950
Oh, the bid-ask spread. On the 20, on the 22.50. So someone, right,

335
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,390
is willing to buy this for 5 cents and someone's willing to sell this for $5.

336
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,910
There's basically no market there. There's no market here, right?

337
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,810
So you need to come in and be able to price this.

338
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:42,720
Now you can't price this without looking at implied vol, right?

339
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,140
You can't just come in here. Imagine you, imagine this Tico.

340
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,420
Imagine you come in here and you're like, okay, mid is $2.50,

341
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,460
I'm going to buy it for $2.50. You would be paying 450% implied vol.

342
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,700
And this is actually guys, what retail people do. Okay,

343
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
I'm convinced even though there is, you know,

344
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,620
there is something happening on this expiration.

345
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:16,020
I'm convinced some group posted about BCLI because of the volatilities through the

346
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,200
roof. And these are the guys buying these options,

347
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,190
right? We got to think about it. It's a cheap, like how in heaven's name,

348
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,660
let's wait, where are we, December, right? We sold the 18, right? Yeah,

349
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:33,900
you know,

350
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,740
how in heaven's name is this going for 390% implied vol on the downside,

351
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,770
right? These are things where, look at this guys,

352
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,870
the stock has to go to zero in order for us to lose money.

353
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,670
Like people are betting on bankruptcy here, right? And not just that,

354
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,170
it's like, well, there's, the stock doesn't go instantly to zero, right?

355
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,190
There's still, you know, a net liquidation value, right?

356
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,260
There's still value to shareholders here. So whoever's betting this,

357
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,440
betting on these things,

358
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,960
it's crazy.

359
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,380
And I think one thing that has to do with it is because the price is so low.

360
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,520
So if this was, let's say a $500 stock,

361
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,680
I don't think we would see 380% implied vol, to be honest.

362
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,300
We'd see maybe a lot less, like 200%.

363
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,920
And Koa is saying we should try and find all of these. Yeah, Koa,

364
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,880
you should start researching this, man. When we have time,

365
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,180
we'll be looking into it a lot as well.

366
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,300
But obviously time is of the essence for a lot of other things right now.

367
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,840
But guys, let me ask you a question, right?

368
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,630
Who the hell would want this payoff? At one point it was trading for two bucks.

369
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,620
Who would want this payoff here, right? This is wild.

370
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,510
This is a wild payoff to me, right?

371
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,620
Stock trading here.

372
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,540
I mean, hey, it could happen. You know, they could get paid off.

373
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,700
Your risk is like, it's like one-to-one risk reward for like,

374
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,180
for you betting on bankruptcy. Like in what world does this make sense?

375
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,040
Would it make sense to like structure a vertical here if you bet on it going down?

376
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:32,820
Yeah, it'd be a lot better. Right, like sell, you know. Even then, right?

377
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,180
It's still not good. It's brutal. It's absolutely brutal.

378
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,540
At least you're making money a little before. Yeah,

379
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,740
at least you're making money a little bit down here. But these, you know,

380
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,940
if we can't look at the world through implied vol,

381
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,720
we're never going to be able to see these opportunities.

382
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:58,520
Okay. Right. You know, I'll use the example I use for statistics and trading,

383
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,360
right? So any of the new members here who's been through the first week,

384
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,920
it's what I say to you guys when we talk about basic stats.

385
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,080
Implied volatility is the language of options.

386
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,280
You need to be able to speak the language to make money, right?

387
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,680
Like you wouldn't move to a foreign country where, you know,

388
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,590
the first language is different and not learn the language. You know,

389
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,800
good luck getting a job, right?

390
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,200
You need to learn the language of the game you're in to be competitive.

391
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,240
And that's what this is.

392
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,190
Yeah, like look at this structure, man.

393
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:37,860
You can't lose money on the downside and you're good all the way up until 30 bucks.

394
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,820
It's free money. Until they say we found the cure for coronavirus.

395
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,560
And it goes all the way. And they're like a mining company.

396
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,600
They're not even a... Yeah, I imagine they're a gold mining company. Come out,

397
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,940
guys, we found the cure. Deep down near the core of the earth.

398
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,300
It was sitting there in a vial for us. Yeah, I think it is a biotech stock.

399
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
So you always got to be careful of these, right? Yeah, brainstorm,

400
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,700
sell therapeutics. But it looks like the bet is it to go into zero. It's not,

401
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,360
no one's betting on this thing going to the moon. Look at the implied vol here,

402
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,600
right?

403
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,060
It might be worth financing a way out of the money call with our free money we're

404
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,330
gathering on the downside. Right? And like you guys know as well.

405
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,870
What are the odds these people are right? And you know, it's actually really,

406
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,490
actually really interesting about this trade,

407
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,650
which is why I think it's like a phenomenal trade.

408
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,910
And this is also how you guys can,

409
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,750
how we can look at the world through implied vol.

410
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,340
The implied volatility is actually higher to the downside.

411
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,200
So what do we know about skew? This is, you know, for the,

412
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,900
we're going to talk about this maybe tomorrow or Wednesday,

413
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,840
but what do we know about skew? Well, if implied vol is higher on the downside,

414
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,040
right?

415
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,120
That means that the market actually thinks the most likely scenario is to the upside,

416
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,960
but the volatility is to the downside. Now,

417
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,060
does that make sense for a biopharma stock that the volatility is to the downside

418
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:59,390
and the most likely scenario is to the upside? No. Right. It don't. It doesn't.

419
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,830
The scenario we should see is volatility to the upside.

420
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,510
And a trickle down if nothing happens. Right. Right. It's,

421
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,660
it's burning cashflow, burning cashflow, spike. But right, right now,

422
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,300
what the market's saying is making money, making money, smash down. It's like,

423
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,560
wait a minute. It's like, this isn't Apple.

424
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,420
That's not how these companies work. Yeah. So, you know,

425
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,060
I think this is a great trade overall.

426
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,060
And it's, it's, it's gonna be really exciting to see it play out.

427
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,780
I know a couple of guys are saying he bought a cheap November call to cover his

428
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,100
upside risk. Yeah. Yeah. So I think we're not, we're not going to strangle.

429
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,870
Yeah. He's actually in this position here. So we're not, Renato is in this,

430
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,810
right? So, and then he took some of the money and bought a,

431
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,780
I believe it was a November 35, right? So here we go.

432
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,220
So you guys are going to like this trade, right?

433
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,880
So Renato bought the Novembers. So this is him right here. Okay.

434
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,550
So right now he spent, so here's his, here's his core position. Okay.

435
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,010
Here's his core position. Now this company could release something huge.

436
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:12,790
We don't know.

437
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,760
Markets saying that there is going to be some type of big move coming up.

438
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,790
So let's say it does jump to 50 bucks, right?

439
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,330
Renato doesn't want that exposure.

440
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,230
So what he did was he spent 35 cents or 25 cents to buy some out of money calls

441
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,960
just to remove that blow up risk. Okay. Just to remove that blow up risk.

442
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,120
And that's actually very, very important in this game.

443
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,140
Okay. So do you guys have any questions about implied volatility?

444
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,040
A general idea of why we use implied volatility and we're getting into more advanced

445
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,000
stuff throughout the, throughout the week.

446
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,000
And then we'll just chat about implied correlation towards the end there.

447
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,840
Cause I know some of the guys would like that.

448
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,920
Actually, Kyle and Neil, let me know if you guys are still here.

449
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,120
Otherwise I will, or Steve, let me know if you guys are still here.

450
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,680
Otherwise I will skip out on an implied correlation.

451
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,870
I think they're still here. Okay.

452
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, Raph. Raph, what's going on man? And Lawrence is here. Lawrence. Hey,

453
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,700
Lawrence. I know you've been dodging me about those trade breakdowns, man.

454
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm following up with you this week. He has, eh? He's been dodging me. Okay,

455
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,900
guys. So no questions about implied volatility. That's it.

456
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,150
All right. Let's move on. Okay. So I'm gonna stop the live. Yep.

457
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,110
Let's stop the live. Okay.
