1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,960
Ok guys, now that you understand what a backspread is,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,400
we are actually going to take that backspread one step further and create a butterfly.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,820
Now a butterfly is the exact same thing as a same strike iron condor.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,130
So remember an iron condor,

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,140
we have a short put and a short call at the same strike,

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,840
and then a long put and a long call as our hedge.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,580
Well a butterfly is actually the exact same structure and there is no difference

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,280
between the two.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,300
So we are actually going to build out a butterfly through a vertical,

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,180
a backspread, and then into a butterfly.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,340
And I am sure some of you are already seeing how this is going to work.

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,110
So to recap, here is our vertical spread.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:00,290
When we cap it off and sell another call, we get a ratio spread.

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,390
Now what we can do here is we can buy another call that is further out of the money.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:16,530
And that is going to cap our loss. So we have created a butterfly spread.

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:26,060
An example would be, this is the 200 call, this is the 210 call,

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,620
we are selling two of these, we only have one of those.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,360
And then we are buying the 220 call, and we are buying just one.

19
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,310
So this is going to be a butterfly spread.

20
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,070
Now a butterfly can be used for many different things,

21
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,870
just like an iron condor. Remember,

22
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,690
a butterfly is an iron condor with the same strike.

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,270
So they can be used in many different scenarios.

24
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,270
One scenario is to be short volatility.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,150
If we think that the stock is not going to move that much, let's say the stock,

26
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,890
let's say Apple,

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,460
is trading at 210.

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,640
Well, we can buy the butterfly, so we are buying the 200 call,

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,440
selling two 210 calls, buying one 220 call,

30
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,880
and as long as the stock stays within this range, we are going to make money.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,340
But that's only one way to trade butterflies. And this way,

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,320
the butterfly is short volatility,

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,900
because we are short two call options that are at the money, or near the money.

34
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,280
But there is another way to trade butterflies, and that is to get direction,

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,860
to get delta, and to trade into skew. So remember, with the backspread,

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,240
we like to trade them when there is high skew. We bought an at the money,

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,100
we sold an out of the money put,

38
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,380
and then we sold another out of the money put to create the backspread. Well,

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,940
we can actually do the same thing with butterflies,

40
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,980
if we don't want this unlimited risk. So let's take a look.

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,920
Apple is trading at 210, and there is a lot of skew on Apple,

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,270
a lot of put skew. So what we can do here, is we can buy the 210 put,

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:32,400
sell two of the 200 puts, because the skew is high,

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,220
maybe the implied volatility here is 30, and here it's 35.

45
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,410
So these are very expensive. And instead of having unlimited risk,

46
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,050
we can actually buy the farther out of the money put to cap our risk off.

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,450
Now obviously, because there is steep skew, this put,

48
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,140
let's say is going to be 40%, is going to be very expensive.

49
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,220
So we're going to be giving a lot of our edge back to the market.

50
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,130
But one thing we are going to get is a debit, meaning we have limited risk.

51
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,450
So by giving up a little bit of edge, we get more margin efficiency,

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,310
and we get a limited downside, which is just the debit we paid.

53
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,330
Maybe this spread costs us $3.

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,200
So our max loss on this trade is going to be $3.

55
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,260
And what we have with this fly now, is we are actually directional.

56
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,920
So if the stock moves down, we're going to make a lot of money,

57
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,220
and if the stock moves too far down, we're going to start losing money.

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,660
So the way I like to trade these butterflies is when I think the stock is going

59
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,760
up or down, and I like to place the fly into the direction of the skew.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,540
And then I also think that the skew is very expensive.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,560
Now the way I like to trade these flies is I like to place them in the direction

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
that I think the stock is going. So if I think, let's say, Apple is going down,

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,900
then I'm going to buy one of these flies.

64
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,740
But another reason why I'm going to buy them is because the skew is expensive.

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,840
So if I'm directional, and there's skew in my direction,

66
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm going to want to buy this butterfly.

67
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,040
And this butterfly is going to offer me a fantastic risk to reward. In fact,

68
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,220
this butterfly right here might be giving me 1 to 10,

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,120
where I risk 1 to make 10. So this is where and why we use butterflies.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,140
Now let's talk about three things. Risk management, days to expiration,

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,300
and which strikes to pick. So in terms of days to expiration,

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,000
what's going to matter is your view on either volatility or direction.

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,280
What you're going to see is, if you go really far out in expiration,

74
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,680
your red line is going to look like this.

75
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,420
Let's say the stock's trading right over here,

76
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,600
meaning that even if the stock does go down,

77
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,020
you're not going to make a lot of money.

78
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,440
But if you trade a fly with 10 days to expiration,

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,880
what you might see is something that looks like this.

80
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,390
Meaning, if the stock does go down, let's say tomorrow,

81
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,790
your instantaneous P&L is going to be positive.

82
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,710
You're actually going to make money. And so if I do have a directional view,

83
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,390
which I usually do when I trade butterflies,

84
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,150
I'm going to be trading these a lot shorter days to expiration,

85
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,350
definitely under two weeks.

86
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,300
If it has more than two weeks,

87
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,060
I'm not going to be able to take advantage of the extra delta I get when the stock

88
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,840
goes down. Now what about risk management? Well, for risk management,

89
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,100
it's very simple. These butterflies usually give you a huge risk reward.

90
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,320
So the way I like to think about these is, if I'm wrong,

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,420
I'm not going to lose a lot of money. But if I'm right,

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,700
I'm going to make a lot of money.

93
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,440
So I usually think about these almost as a lottery ticket,

94
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,080
where if I don't win, that's okay. If I do enough of these though,

95
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,260
eventually my positive expected value in the trade is going to show itself.

96
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,690
Lastly, we're going to be talking about which strikes to pick. Well, again,

97
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,790
this is totally up to you. If you want to be short gamma or short volatility,

98
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:36,490
then you want to do something where the body is going to be at the money.

99
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,290
And if you want direction,

100
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,250
then this short strike is going to be in the direction that you want.

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,570
So if you're bearish, this is going to be below 210. The width of the strikes,

102
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:54,010
you really have to play around with them because there's no one size fits all strikes.

103
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,990
The wider you go, the higher the room for error. The smaller you go,

104
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,510
the smaller the room for error.

105
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,130
As this butterfly is going to start becoming very, very narrow.

106
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,580
So I hope you guys understand what a butterfly is and when to use it.

107
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,830
These are a very popular strategy that I like to use because you have max risk,

108
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,350
which is the debit you pay, and they're very versatile.

109
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,490
You can use them to be short volatility, or you can use them for direction,

110
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,010
or you can use them to trade into skew.

111
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,250
So I hope you guys found that video insightful,

112
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,690
and I'll talk to you in the next one.
