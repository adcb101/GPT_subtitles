1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,460
Alright guys, so in this live,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,000
we are going to be talking about filtering for put spreads in the Predicting the

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Alpha Terminal. We're also going to be briefly talking about put spreads,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,040
when to use them, when not to use them,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,160
how to be able to quickly find them in the terminal,

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,880
and then going into execution. The reason why this live is so important,

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,520
and I'm happy to see,

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,600
especially the members that came into PA using put spreads here,

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,140
is that the terminal has a lot of power,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,280
and there's a million different things that you can do with it.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,580
But the easiest way to get started using the terminal is to use it to start applying

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,600
data to the decisions you're already trying to make.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,620
If you're out there trading put spreads right now,

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,830
you can improve upon what you already do simply by adding this new layer of filtering

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,430
to the trades that you're looking at.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,270
So what we're going to be going through is,

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,630
there's going to be really two sections to this live. The first section,

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,650
we're going to keep it really straightforward.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,430
How do you use the terminal to find trades where you can be systematically looking

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,830
at using put spreads? If put spreads are your go-to tool,

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,860
here's how you can find trades to be trading put spreads on that are optimal.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Like the perfect,

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,820
a few filters you can apply that create sort of like the perfect storm for put spreads.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,200
Sorry, go on. At least from the volatility standpoint. Yeah,

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,280
from the vol standpoint. We obviously,

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,050
you got to have a directional view as well,

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,310
which the terminal doesn't forecast direction, it forecast volatility.

28
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,850
But from that standpoint, that's usually the component that's missing.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,590
Usually you have your directional bias without the view on volatility.

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,170
Now you can add that second piece to the puzzle.

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,220
The second half of the live is we're going to go into the components of our filter.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,800
Why did we care about skew?

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,580
Why did we care about the level of implied volatility, for example?

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,620
Why do we care about these things?

35
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,020
So that is what this live is going to look like. And then maybe we'll finally,

36
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,210
at the end, structure out a bunch of them. Exactly. Yeah. Okay.

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,590
So as we go along, make sure to leave your questions in the chat there.

38
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,450
I'll be keeping an eye on the chat.

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,850
If it's extremely pertinent to what we're talking about at the time,

40
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,330
we'll answer it. But if not,

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,910
you can expect it to be answered at the end of the live,

42
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,270
or maybe at the little break between sessions.

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,080
And maybe even before we share a screen, I thought I'd give a little story.

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,180
When I was first starting into trading and how put spreads were really the ideal

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,120
thing for me, right? So it was around the election time, 2016,

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,500
and implied volatility was very high going into the elections.

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,080
And I was also bullish on the market.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,860
And so the trade that I did was I sold an out-of-the-money put spread, okay?

49
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,240
I sold an out-of-the-money put spread.

50
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,580
I sold about the Delta 30 and bought the Delta 16 about 20 days out.

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,140
And I collected a premium and the vol dropped, stock rallied.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,860
And I thought this was the trade, right? It makes a lot of sense.

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,960
I think the stock is going to go up,

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,860
and if at least it doesn't come below this price, I'm going to make money.

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,240
Right? And so it's really like the perfect storm for a retail trader.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,640
And we always got to remember where we came from, right?

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,140
And try to put ourselves in those shoes to really understand what other people are

58
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,180
thinking of when we're talking about these put spreads, okay?

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,620
So just to make sure everyone's on the same page, if the stock, or here,

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,620
why don't we just put one on just so everyone knows that we're all on the same page,

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,340
okay? So Boeing, I was just talking to Pranav about this,

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,980
we think Boeing is going to go up. So we might come in and sell, for example,

63
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:09,630
it's trading at 207. We might come in and sell a 195, 185 put spread, okay?

64
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:21,530
Pretty typical from a trader standpoint, right? Here we are. Okay?

65
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,420
Boeing is trading right over here right now. And if Boeing continues to go up,

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,060
we're going to make some money.

67
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,540
And if Boeing doesn't go below a certain threshold, right,

68
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,080
we're still going to make some money. Which would be right here,

69
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,030
which would be over there. This is a pretty standard approach for a put spread.

70
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,010
Now, the thing about a put spread is it's actually very versatile, okay?

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,340
Depending on how wide we make the strikes, where we put the strikes, okay,

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
how far out in time we put the strikes, we will have different exposures,

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,520
right?

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,940
The beauty about spread trading is you can customize it to have a ton of different

75
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,480
exposures.

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,940
So let us take a look at this very particular one here, super quick,

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,420
just we'll take a look at a basic risk profile before we start to,

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,660
just so we can get a sense of what they're really expressing before we go and scan

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,740
for it, okay? So if we look right here, okay, we look down here,

80
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,060
we can see a couple of things, okay? We're long delta,

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,350
meaning we think the stock, we want the stock to go up, okay?

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,410
We're also long theta, meaning we want time to pass, right?

83
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,650
If time passes and nothing happens, we're going to make money,

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,940
and we're short vega. So if volatility drops, we're also going to make money,

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,500
okay? And that is the characteristic of this particular short credit spread.

86
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,920
So why don't we go in and start scanning for these, okay? And in the comments,

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,820
as we're going over to the PA terminal,

88
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,630
I want to ask you guys the question of what do you think we might scan for,

89
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,390
okay? What do you think we might scan for given this vertical spread, okay?

90
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,870
And we're going to, as you guys write down your comments there,

91
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,390
we're going to head over to the terminal and figure it out.

92
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,500
So we're going to head over to volatility insights tab. And this tab,

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,500
as you guys know, it has all the volatility characteristics.

94
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,780
All we're going to focus on right now is this top section up here, right?

95
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,560
This right here is what we're going to be using. This is the area,

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,540
it's basically just our scanner.

97
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,460
It allows us to filter all the opportunities out there to find ones that meet a

98
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,020
particular criteria for us.

99
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
So for the purposes of finding the trades to put spreads on,

100
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,070
this is where you're going to look, okay? So you just come to the terminal,

101
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,510
you go to volatility insights. Okay. And honestly,

102
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,170
this is Sean's bread and butter, I thought he was going to take it away here.

103
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,290
So we showed what our risk profile was, right? What we benefit from,

104
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,990
from time passing, from volatility dropping, from stock increasing.

105
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,430
So right off the bat,

106
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,930
we're going to need the most important thing of this put spread right now.

107
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,010
And as we can see quickly here from this put spread,

108
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,190
that our biggest risk is this Delta factor.

109
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,670
Meaning we need the stock to go up and we need the stock to go up.

110
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,330
So before we even put on this put spread,

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,200
our view needs to be that the stock is going to go up.

112
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,310
Whatever fundamental reason we have, it's got to be there. Okay.

113
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,390
And that should be sound. Now,

114
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,310
we're not really going to talk about the Delta view, but briefly,

115
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,430
that view of Delta needs to be sound. Okay.

116
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,990
You can't just say the stock is going to be breaking out,

117
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,210
so I'm going to buy this, sell this vertical spread.

118
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,010
You need something more sound, something more reasonable. Okay.

119
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,250
Something that might actually have an edge, right?

120
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,080
You need to have an edge in Delta. Okay. If you don't have that,

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:09,580
this trade is not the best trade to place. Okay. So that's the first thing.

122
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,780
Now obviously, you might be able to use this,

123
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,520
the scanner for your own Delta view. For example,

124
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,220
if you want to scan for call put ratio,

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,360
maybe you think that the more calls than puts being bought,

126
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,360
that the stock is going to continue to go up. Okay. So you might use that,

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,860
for example.

128
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,590
Another thing you could use is the skew, right? Which is basically,

129
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,990
this is a different topic for a different lecture,

130
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,590
but this kind of tells you where the market thinks the stock is going to go.

131
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:47,030
Okay. Most likely. But what we're really going to focus on first is volatility.

132
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,830
Okay. So we are going to make money if volatility drops.

133
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,530
So the first thing we want to see is that IV is greater than our forecast.

134
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,040
Right. So we might scan for this being greater than one. Okay.

135
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,990
Maybe we'll do like 1.5. Okay. Right off the bat,

136
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,280
we narrow it down to 400 stocks. Okay. So IV greater than our forecast.

137
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,240
What we also might want to see is that there's some implied volatility. Right.

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,800
So we might say, let's go over 35. Right.

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
There's got to be some juice in this thing.

140
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,050
And then the last thing that I like to scan for is IV rank above 50. Okay.

141
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,710
This at least tells us that it's above the median. Right.

142
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,460
That this thing probably could come down. Right. Oh, I'm sorry. That was... No.

143
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,380
You want this as well? Yeah. Yeah. In a second.

144
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,300
We'll first talk about the vols here. So actually, maybe we'll go above 60.

145
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,460
Okay. So now we have...

146
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,380
Right now we filtered for basically Sean's bread and butter daily live. Right.

147
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:56,200
It's the IV greater than forecast and implied volatility pretty high.

148
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,420
And there is some, at least some volatility. Okay.

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,420
So that's from the IV 30 that we just scanned for here.

150
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,970
The other thing I like to do, like, you know, you don't really need to,

151
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,680
you know, you don't have to do this, but I usually like to,

152
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,460
because it's a spread, right, we want to see some type of volume, right.

153
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,090
Some type of liquidity. If there's no liquidity, right. The more,

154
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,990
the more legs you have on a trade and the less liquid,

155
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,600
the more edge you're giving away. Okay. There's no two corners around that.

156
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,060
The less liquid, the more legs, the more you're paying commission, slippage,

157
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,520
et cetera.

158
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,290
So we want to have some type of liquidity there,

159
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,130
and you can just scan for that in average option volume. Now, so far, okay,

160
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,430
we've scanned for high volume and high volatility.

161
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,640
We've narrowed it down to 30 stocks. Okay.

162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,320
So all of these are potential candidates.

163
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,160
Now something else that's a little bit more on the complex side about these vertical

164
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,560
spreads is that they're different strikes. Okay. They're not the same strike.

165
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,280
They're different strikes. And so because of that, right,

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,580
we go back to think or swim here because we have different strikes,

167
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,640
we are buying and selling at different implied volatilities. Okay.

168
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
And just so you guys, you know, just so you know, I'm not going crazy here.

169
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,080
You can see that we're selling this at 48.2%, right?

170
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:31,360
We're selling this with this 195 and we're buying this one at 49.65, okay?

171
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,870
So we're selling at 48 and a half and buying at 49 and a half. Now,

172
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,490
we can actually scan for, okay, those volatilities, right?

173
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:51,430
We can actually scan for something where the out of the money put that we're buying

174
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,010
is cheaper than the at the money put we're selling. Okay.

175
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,300
And that is going to be in our skew factor. That's going to come down to this.

176
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,160
Yeah. Oh, you know, I'm probably going to scan for, I'm going to scan for,

177
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm going to use skew rank here. I'm going to use skew rank.

178
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,620
And what I'm going to scan for is it's below 50. Okay.

179
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,080
So that means that the skew is less than the median. Okay.

180
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,660
So we're going to take a look at an example here. Okay. So right off the bat,

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,110
we have Pinterest. Okay. We got Pinterest right off the bat.

182
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,650
So let's take a look here.

183
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,740
And just before I actually move into thinkorswim, does everyone see Pinterest?

184
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,620
Is everyone okay with us using Pinterest here? So this is our scan.

185
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,520
This is our scan, right? So before we move on,

186
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,800
let's maybe do a little checklist here. Yeah. A little recap.

187
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,940
We'll do a recap and a checklist. I'll show you what I mean.

188
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,660
So let's look at what we did here. Firstly,

189
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,000
first thing we do is we apply our filter that we, you know,

190
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,340
pretty much do every time. Liquidity. Right. Price and liquidity.

191
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,400
And we didn't do price this time, but you know,

192
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,180
see it over 15 bucks and make sure it's liquid.

193
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,020
That's filter one is to make sure we have, you know,

194
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,100
it's within the realm of something we should be trading.

195
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,920
The second filter is our vol filter where we put,

196
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,240
we want to see the IV versus forecast high.

197
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,860
We want to see some implied volatility and we want to see the IV rank up.

198
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,800
Right? So then once we've applied those,

199
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,800
we are looking at ones that fit our volatility criteria only from there.

200
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,080
We know that we want to make sure that that out of the money put that we're buying

201
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,990
is not extremely expensive relative to the closer to at the money put that we're

202
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,730
selling. What we need to look for that is we need to filter for skew. Right?

203
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:57,110
So what we'll do is this quick, right?

204
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,210
You guys can take a little screenshot of this if you want.

205
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,060
Number one is the liquidity and price filters.

206
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
Number two is volatility filters,

207
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:32,070
which would be IV versus forecast greater than one. IV greater than 35.

208
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,560
And IV rank greater than 50. All right.

209
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,480
And then the last one here we're going to put is IV rank greater than 50.

210
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:51,700
There now we have skew filter, which would be skew rank above or below 50.

211
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,510
If we just come back up here quick. For liquidity filters,

212
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:06,160
option volume above 6,000, let's say, and price above $15.

213
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:19,060
Any questions about these? This would be the PA vertical scan. Put spread scan.

214
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,460
Put spread scan. Yeah. Sorry. Short put spread scan. Jared's asking,

215
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,620
when are we getting the put spreads button? Jared,

216
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,960
we were keeping that a secret. It was a surprise coming this week.

217
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,960
You ruined it, man. You're letting the cat out of the bag here.

218
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,170
Soon enough, you'll be able to do this with the click of a button.

219
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,320
Or not. Or not. Jared doesn't know what he's talking about.

220
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,120
Jared's drinking again. Yeah. Jared's drinking again.

221
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:46,980
Okay.

222
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,910
So will you be able to alter the scan? So Mark,

223
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,350
the way we're going to be doing it is we're going to have a homepage button or a

224
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,430
homepage tab that's going to have a bunch of different strategies with preset filters,

225
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,290
and it'll pull up the top 10 for it, let's say.

226
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,400
So whether it's like put spreads or covered calls or whatever you might want to

227
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,600
be doing. But then you'll be able to see what those are,

228
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,740
and you'll be able to adjust your own filters in the vol insights page.

229
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,220
Actually, guys, just a quick thing from Mark. For the more advanced guys,

230
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm not going to be talking about too much,

231
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,840
but reach out to Mark about trading long debit vertical spreads.

232
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,860
I learned something from him in the summertime where you can place these trades

233
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,460
where you think volatility is insanely high and they're skewed in one direction.

234
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,240
Because as long as you get some type of movement, you know,

235
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,180
imagine a stock's random, right?

236
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,300
As long as we get some type of movement in that direction, it usually pays off.

237
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,080
So reach out to Mark for anyone who wants to trade long debit spreads,

238
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,140
or we'll do another live on it down the road.

239
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,780
But he's got some good ideas for those. Okay.

240
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,800
So I'm assuming everyone has their screenshot of this. Actually,

241
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,180
I'll just save it, and we'll throw it up in the group after.

242
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,710
Blessing's asking, do we have any concerns about days to expiration?

243
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:22,640
So Blessing, remember, the vertical spread, which towards the end,

244
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,560
we're going to put a whole bunch on, they can have different exposures, right?

245
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,120
They can have different risk factors.

246
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,080
So if you're putting a vertical spread further out in time, right,

247
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,500
you're going to be very sensitive to a drop in implied volatility, okay?

248
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,040
But that also depends on how close you're putting the strikes.

249
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,600
So it's not that we're concerned about days to expiration,

250
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:52,910
it's that do we want to put something on that expresses a certain view? Okay,

251
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,970
so there's never a time where it's like, I'm worried about this, right?

252
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,070
Because at the end of the day,

253
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:06,170
you can just – It's just a knob we can adjust to tweak what our view is.

254
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,370
Exactly. Right?

255
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,730
We're not going to focus on that too much for this live, to be honest,

256
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,010
Blessing,

257
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:19,210
because this is really tailored for – if you look out in the educational space for

258
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,450
options right now, a lot of people talk about put spreads.

259
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,110
So a lot of people are coming in here doing put spreads right off the bat anyways.

260
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,870
As they're learning, they're doing put spreads,

261
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,550
and we feel an obligation to make sure that people who are trading something that

262
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,210
maybe isn't in the Bronze education are still making the best decision possible

263
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,400
for what they're trying to do. And this is really for that person. And,

264
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,680
you know, if you learn about put spreads,

265
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,800
we'll do more talks about them in the future, et cetera.

266
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,260
This will help you fit whatever you choose to end up doing. And don't forget,

267
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,170
guys, from that screen that Sean showed, the scanner, most importantly,

268
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,440
is you need to have a long delta bias. Okay?

269
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,640
You need to have some type of long delta bias.

270
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,220
And we're not going to chat too much about, like,

271
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,140
what would make something a good or bad long delta bias.

272
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,120
Everyone has their different reasons,

273
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,900
and we're not necessarily the best delta traders either.

274
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,590
So, Mark, do you mind maybe elaborating a little bit about that, Mark?

275
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,850
Are you saying because, like, an iron condor is basically just, like,

276
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,340
two different spreads combined? I'm not 100% sure what you mean there, Mark.

277
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,320
If you can just maybe elaborate a little bit, then I'll mention it. Okay.

278
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,540
So now that we have that spread, we have Pinterest that came out on the list.

279
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,280
Okay? Now, this isn't on the top of the list. We could, let's say, filter.

280
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,500
So we're filtering for IV versus forecast right now.

281
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,980
And you can just turn the knobs there, whatever you guys are looking for.

282
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,800
So we're going to use Pinterest right now. I feel like it's a good one to use.

283
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,860
And let's say we have a bullish bias on Pinterest, right?

284
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,260
We think Pinterest is going to go up. Well, what we could do here,

285
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,620
we're going to structure out a couple here. We could come here 37 days out,

286
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,120
let's say, and sell an at-the-money, right?

287
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,840
Sell an at-the-money vertical strike.

288
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,640
And then let's say buy a little bit further out, maybe, let's say, 55. Okay?

289
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,280
Or why don't we say 60?

290
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay, so here is this put spread.

291
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:48,910
All right? And also remember, guys, depending on this, you might, let's say,

292
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,210
do between a 55 and a 60 put, right, is going to give you more delta exposure.

293
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,590
It's also going to increase your rega exposure. Okay,

294
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,390
so we're going to do a couple here. So we're going to do the 70-60,

295
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,570
and we're also going to do the 70-50. Okay?

296
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,070
So let's look at the 70-50 first, right? Someone might come and say, hey,

297
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,670
you know, this is terrible risk-reward trade. Well,

298
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,810
it's not terrible risk-reward trade.

299
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,800
It's just expressing something maybe a little bit different. So in this case,

300
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,740
right, you're going to see here that our delta is 316.

301
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
Let's store it to one lot. Oh, yeah, okay, let's do one lot.

302
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:43,020
Okay, so this delta is 31. So it's like you own 31 shares. And this one, okay,

303
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,350
is 18. So right off the bat, the difference between these two, first off,

304
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:55,810
is that you're more bullish. Right, so how bullish are you on Pinterest? Now,

305
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,010
what else is a little different here? Well, look at our theta and vega, okay?

306
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:06,480
Theta is 7 here, and it's only 3 here. Okay,

307
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,780
so we're not as sensitive to time with this one. And lastly, look at our vega.

308
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,380
It's negative 3 when the other one was negative 7. So this one,

309
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,440
we're more sensitive, okay, to volatility collapsing. Now,

310
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,580
one mistake I see a lot of the time that traders do,

311
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,540
and I wouldn't say it's a mistake, but I think they put it on unknowing,

312
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,500
is they do these extremely, extremely tight spreads way out of the money, okay,

313
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,490
or even at the money. I guess at the money is not bad,

314
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,120
but I'll see sometimes traders do something like this, okay,

315
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,950
because they don't want to lose, so they'll sell way out of the money,

316
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,110
and they're going to do it super tight, okay? And they're going to say, okay,

317
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,620
well, as long as that thing goes up, right?

318
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,900
And this is really what we want to be thinking with these spreads, okay?

319
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,560
Look at our exposures here, right? Our exposures are almost nothing, right?

320
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,230
Go to a 1 lot here. Sorry, we're at a 10 lot, okay?

321
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,650
Our exposures are really nothing.

322
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,530
There's nothing really exciting going to be happening with this spread,

323
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,250
win or lose, right?

324
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,950
And so I think it's important that when we do these spreads,

325
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,350
we do them with conviction.

326
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,000
We do them with a real desire to want to put this trade on, right?

327
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,300
It's got to be meaningful, right? So doing something like this,

328
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,750
I don't know how to say it,

329
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,330
but it's like I would never do this in a million years.

330
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,520
I guess that's the best way that I can explain it.

331
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,570
Do you have anything to say about this one? I think you summed it up. So,

332
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,630
you know, depending on the different put spreads, right?

333
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,630
But let's also take a look here, guys. Remember how we scanned for that skew,

334
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,540
right? Let's take a look.

335
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,720
We're selling here at 88 and buying at 87 on this one, okay? Now,

336
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,060
that's not a huge deal. And, you know, because we're buying further out, right,

337
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,120
it's, you know, a couple points difference is not big. Sometimes we'll see,

338
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,590
though, people do this on the S&P 500, okay?

339
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,110
And look what happens when we do this on the S&P 500.

340
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,260
Look what happens here. You end up selling at, let's say,

341
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,600
a 17 vol and buying at a 22 vol, right?

342
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,680
So this put spread is not going to give you a great risk to reward.

343
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,000
So that's why we scanned for that skew.

344
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,980
And there's actually a little bit more in-depth reason for it,

345
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,020
but we're actually not going to talk about it on this live.

346
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,020
So do you guys have any questions about this? And key thing to know, guys,

347
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,940
like when it comes to developing a directional view,

348
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,840
there's a lot of different ways you can go about doing it, right?

349
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,620
Like, you know, one thing you can maybe think,

350
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,180
if you're selling something a little bit longer dated,

351
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
you think the macro environment is good. Well,

352
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,190
if you're trading something that's correlated with the S&P, well, there you go,

353
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,690
right? You know,

354
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,370
you don't need to have a directional edge that you think this thing's going to go

355
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,890
to the moon.

356
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,210
You need to be more confident that this thing's going to move up and down.

357
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,140
So Mark has a really good point here, right?

358
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,550
A lot of time we need to really just understand these structures, right?

359
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,290
Because sometimes let's say you might sell a put, right?

360
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,990
And then next thing you know, you're, you know,

361
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,110
you're buying it out of the money put to offset that down the road, right?

362
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,230
Let's say the stock's going down and you say, okay, you know what?

363
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,970
I got to hedge something here. Maybe I'm going to buy an out of the money put,

364
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,470
right? If we look at, let's say a market maker's book,

365
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,940
he's going to have a ton of different spreads on, right?

366
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,500
And he's going to try to look at it through one lens. Mark,

367
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,940
I think that's what you're trying to get at. I'm not 100% sure. If not,

368
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,620
maybe you can make a little post about it. You know, try to read.

369
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,320
Definitely in depth for this slide, but yeah,

370
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,880
definitely too deep for this slide,

371
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,480
but that would be a whole live in and of itself.

372
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,980
And that's actually one probably worth talking about. Yeah. And I actually,

373
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,340
I actually recommend it. You do reach out to Mark for these types,

374
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,380
these types of spreads.

375
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,680
I've learned some stuff from him over the summer regarding it. And Mark,

376
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,500
thank you in advance for your generous donation of time to everyone who will DM

377
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,060
you.

378
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,440
So, but is everyone understanding when to use a put spread,

379
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,670
when not to use a put spread, right?

380
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,730
We would use a put spread when we have high,

381
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,410
when we think implied volatility is too expensive.

382
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,190
We think the stock is going to go up and we think,

383
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,190
And we're not paying too much for those out of the money wings that we sold for

384
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,810
at the money, right? That is the skew.

385
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,110
The difference involves between the strikes. Okay. Now,

386
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,630
once we have that view on, we can make a solid trade.

387
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,530
And just given the time that we're at now,

388
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,430
I think it actually makes sense to do a part two tomorrow where we talk about the

389
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,380
components. Yes. Okay. So,

390
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,780
and let me just show you guys super quick what the skew does. Okay.

391
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,060
How the skew affects it. So let's say for example,

392
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,200
we're going to do two trades here. We're going to do a three 80. Okay.

393
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,590
We're going to sell them at the money call spread. Okay.

394
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,300
So S and P has a ton of skew. Okay.

395
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,750
So we're going to sell an at the money call spread here. Okay. So here it is.

396
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,560
And we're going to get $5 and 12 cents for it.

397
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,770
Now what we're going to do is do the exact same thing on the put side,

398
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,440
$10 wide, exactly the same. Okay. And look at the difference.

399
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:05,270
One is going for $5 and 12 cents and the other is going for $2 and 84 cents,

400
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,040
right? Here is the exact same thing. We're going to three 80, $10 out.

401
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,220
We'll look at that difference. Okay. Look at that difference.

402
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,030
And the reason is on this call spread that we're looking at here,

403
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,660
we're selling at 17 and buying at 14 on the put spread.

404
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,040
We're selling at 17 and buying at 20. Okay.

405
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,690
And that is going to make all the difference. So this is the,

406
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,750
this is how we want to look for these spreads. Okay.

407
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,250
Does that make sense to everyone? What do you guys think opinions?

408
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,060
Okay. Mark, I might have to actually learn this one from you.

409
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,100
So if you don't mind maybe in traders chat, if you can write a little,

410
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,780
if you can write a little message about it in traders chat,

411
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,800
I would love to read it afterwards. Yeah. And, and yeah,

412
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,720
that's exactly what we're saying, right?

413
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,040
Like and tomorrow's live, we will go in depth on that. Okay.

414
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,040
Cause that we like, we really, you know,

415
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,160
I don't want to give you a one liner and then make it confusing.

416
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,000
We'll just go in depth on that on tomorrow's life. Last thing is asking,

417
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,190
can you please repeat the criteria? So let's do this. Here it is again.

418
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,410
These are the filters we're going to use.

419
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,270
We want to make sure it's liquid and have a good price.

420
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,300
We need our vol filter and we need our skew filter down the road.

421
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,420
Hopefully not too far down the road. This is going to be available to you.

422
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,380
Boom. Like preset done. You just look at it and be like, here's the top five.

423
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,720
If I wanted, if any of these fit my bullish view,

424
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,300
these are the best ones to be doing it on.

425
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,620
And I think blessing also asked, you know,

426
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,560
the probably the most important question, right?

427
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,980
The most important question is, you know, Sean touched on as well,

428
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,480
is how do you build a directional bias or how do you,

429
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,520
how do you build that directional edge? And you know what guys,

430
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,640
it is a directional edge. You can make a ton of money with,

431
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,640
with a directional edge. So we really, it's, it's difficult to build one out.

432
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,720
It's there.

433
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,970
It will be a whole, a whole lecture on building out directional edge.

434
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,530
Personally, Sean and I, we don't look at charts. Okay.

435
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,730
But rarely are we trading a Delta,

436
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,100
but there's nothing wrong with trading Delta. Okay.

437
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,490
It's it's just something that Sean and I are not, let's say the best app.

438
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,040
All right.

439
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,440
Okay.

440
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,780
So we are going to continue this tomorrow on tomorrow's live where we actually are

441
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,720
going to go into each of those filters and really explain them.

442
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,340
The main one we're going to be focusing on is that skew element. All right.

443
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,220
Because at first glance, you're going to be like, wait, I don't get it.

444
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,040
Something tricky here. We're really, really dig into it.

445
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,400
And I literally picked this topic for you. I'm so happy that you liked it.

446
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,080
And on our next call, I, I hope to see how you're using it to, to, you know,

447
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,900
make great trades. And, and make sure to bring Alan.

448
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,140
I don't know where he is today. Oh, I'm sure. Come on. I don't know.

449
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,580
He's got to be there. It's one of his favorite topics too.

450
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,750
Oh, he was with the boys. Okay.

451
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,470
Make sure you make sure he's out here tomorrow and I'll upload the recording tonight

452
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,450
so that he can watch it.

453
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,540
He's definitely gonna be watching it tomorrow night tonight, but you know,

454
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,140
when it, when it wakes up tomorrow afternoon, he can give it a watch.

455
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,760
All right. Have a great night, everyone. See you guys. See you around.
