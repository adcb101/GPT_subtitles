1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,360
Okay, guys, so in this video, in this lecture, in this workshop,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,790
we're going to be talking about our Tesla trade, why we shorted vol today,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,970
and why we shorted a strangle over a straddle. Okay, so those,

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,530
that's what we're really gonna be talking about breaking down this trade in depth.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,230
And also all the other nuances that come with it.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,910
And then going really deep into like,

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,570
why strangle versus straddle and like the differences between the two and why we

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,130
picked one over the other. Especially because a lot of the time, guys,

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,430
we're gonna hear in this space, like a strangle is safer than a straddle,

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,230
right? How many times I think we got John on here, right? John, perfect.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,670
We got John here. You know, how many times tasty trade tells us right,

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,230
a strangle is the safer straddle, right?

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,190
A delta 16 strangle is a much better and safer trade than say doing it at the money

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,840
straddle. And so this is actually not the case,

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,700
it's actually the complete opposite. And so in this in this video,

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,600
we're gonna be chatting about that, right? Why is it the complete opposite?

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,380
And you know, when I first found this out as well,

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,100
it was brought a lot of insight insight to me. And, you know,

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,780
I hope you guys find that insightful as well.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,750
So share my screen.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,450
Alright.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,920
So first off, why Tesla, right? Why are we shorting vol on Tesla?

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,170
So let's see what's going on here. And by the way, guys,

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,150
the terminal should be good to go from now on. No more. No kinks. Yeah,

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,240
no more bet. No more messy bugs. But you know, as soon as we say that,

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,020
there's a there's a bug, there's a bug.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:53,320
Okay, so pull this up. So guys, look at the implied vol 30, okay?

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,400
It's actually it caught a bid today. So as you guys know,

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm been short vol right around here. And today it caught a huge bid. Okay.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,570
Now, Tesla, Tesla has been recently, you know, put into the S&P index.

31
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,300
And it seems like if we go to the if we look at the implied volatility and spot

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,820
correlation,

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,020
we can see that every like there's a slight correlation right between when,

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
when the spot change, okay, when when Tesla goes up,

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,360
implied volatility increases. Okay,

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,480
you guys can see that this is very interesting by the slope of the line, right?

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,060
Usually, let's say if we're looking at the S&P, okay, we're looking at the S&P,

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,440
when when the S&P goes down, I vol drops, or I vol increases.

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,220
And when the S&P increases, I vol drops. But for Tesla,

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,860
we're seeing the totally, we're seeing something totally different. Okay.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,820
And that's what's happening. The last two days, Tesla has been rallying,

42
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,830
it's gone from 600 to 650, and it's rallying overnight. Okay,

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,970
so for that reason, right? We're seeing this increase in implied volatility,

44
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,070
we're seeing this increase in the option prices.

45
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,510
Now, we need to come to a conclusion. Is this overpriced?

46
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,710
Or is this underpriced? Okay.

47
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,270
And one thing that is driving this news is that Tesla is going into the S&P 500.

48
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,110
Now we need to think about this as from a trader's perspective,

49
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,350
is this changing the overall business?

50
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,490
Should this change the volatility of the overall company? Right? And you know,

51
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,700
Sean, I think the answer is no. Right? In fact,

52
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,320
we think this is going to drop vol.

53
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,500
There's extra liquidity coming into the market now, right?

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,260
It's a bigger company, right? As the company grows in size, vol needs to drop.

55
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,350
Right? It's harder to go from 100 trillion,

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,830
or let's say half a billion to a trillion, than it is to go from, let's say,

57
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,560
500,000 to a million. Right? So as this company grows in size,

58
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,840
vol needs to drop. And so what we're seeing is the complete opposite.

59
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,920
Vol is increasing. Oh, by the way,

60
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,420
Tesla's also just announced they're raising 5 billion more.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,230
I've heard about this. Yes. So, and they even might be introducing, I think,

62
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,790
$100 billion worth of shares. If you want to just confirm that, Cole,

63
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,730
I think they're going to be releasing,

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,170
they're going to be providing a whole bunch of more liquidity into the market,

65
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,410
if you can just confirm that.

66
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,230
So, you know, some news coming out with this company, and, you know,

67
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,170
it's driving iVol, right? It's driving up the price of these premiums.

68
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,450
People are saying, oh my God, this thing's unreal. It's going to the moon.

69
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,010
Right? And, you know, a couple of people in our chat also believe it,

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,180
rightly so. Right? They've been right. No, Tico? Congrats.

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,100
We can't say he's been wrong. He's been absolutely spot on. Right?

72
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,500
So all this money coming into Tesla, driving up the price, driving up the vol.

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,300
We've got shorts who are short the shares, covering with call options. Right?

74
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,360
If they're short the shares, how are they going to hedge?

75
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,970
They've got to buy some call options. Right? So,

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,140
and it's been driving up the vol like crazy. So what we can see here now, guys,

77
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,500
we're going to start breaking it down in terms of the option prices and the volatility

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,660
for these option prices. Well, let's take a look, right? Here we have,

79
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,360
so remember we were talking about the volatility cone yesterday?

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,680
We're going to drop, we're going to drop the max, we're going to drop the min,

81
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,890
and we're just going to look at the third quantile, the first quantile,

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,020
the median, and the max, and the current. So remember, most of the time,

83
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:47,070
vol is going to be within this range. Okay? But it's way above right now. Okay?

84
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:54,360
It's at the 20 days at 100, the 30 days at 95, and the 45 days at 92. Okay?

85
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,980
So the market's telling us something is off. Right?

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,820
There should be a ton of vol. And we don't, we actually don't,

87
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,380
we actually don't agree with them here.

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,720
We think vol is going to eventually drop down into this range again. Okay?

89
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,250
And here's one of the reasons why. Look at the realized vol, guys.

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm going to head over to Relative Value to look at this.

91
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,300
Okay, so we're going to plot the implied vol 30 and the realized vol 30. Okay?

92
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,920
And the ratio.

93
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,070
So let's take a look here. Right? Let's take a look at this top graph here.

94
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,320
Well, look at the realized vol. It's only at 65. The eyeball, the realized vol,

95
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,640
how much it's actually moving has only been at 65,

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,370
yet the implied vol for the 30 days at 95%. Okay?

97
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,950
It's extremely big given how much this thing is actually moving. Right?

98
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,910
If we look at today, for example, it's only been up 3% or 2%,

99
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,840
yet vol has increased drastically. Right? And when we compare those ratios,

100
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,540
when we compare the implied volatility relative to the realized volatility,

101
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,680
what's actually happening, we can see we're approaching almost all-time highs.

102
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,470
Okay? Besides these like little pops here, okay,

103
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,890
besides this little pop and this little pop,

104
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,030
we're approaching almost all-time highs. Right?

105
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,020
We're almost getting back up to this 1.5 ratio. Right?

106
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,880
And what does this tell us? Well,

107
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,130
it tells us that one of two things are going to happen. One,

108
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,500
implied vol is going to drop, or two, realized vol is going to increase. Right?

109
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,360
That's the only thing that's going to drop this ratio back down to its mean.

110
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,540
And what we're saying is,

111
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
the realized vol is actually not going to be increasing.

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,580
There's too many things that, there's too much liquidity in this market.

113
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,070
Maybe we'll stop for one second there.

114
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,310
Maybe we can talk about why this spread would drop back to its mean.

115
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,590
What is the relationship between implied and realized that would make it mean reverting?

116
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,930
Really good point. Really good point. So remember,

117
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,090
if implied vol is above realized vol, right,

118
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,090
if it's too far above realized vol,

119
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,930
then people who are selling options are going to earn a ton of money.

120
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,190
So they're just going to come in and sell more and more and more.

121
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,370
So what's going to happen is, eventually,

122
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,770
the spread between implied and realized is going to collapse. Right?

123
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,590
Either realized vol needs to increase, or implied needs to decrease. Otherwise,

124
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,830
they're just going to keep earning all this money all the way through.

125
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,570
So to try and make it simple, it might be too simple,

126
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,720
but you could almost think of it as like a cat and mouse game,

127
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,360
where they're kind of like always chasing each other, implied and realized.

128
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,320
Yes. Right? If the spread gets too big, it comes back together in some way.

129
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,220
Because if implied just stays higher than realized,

130
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,780
and it's not like insider trading or something, well,

131
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,980
sellers are just going to crush. They're just going to make a ton of money.

132
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,300
Right? So it's always, the market's always trying to be efficient as possible,

133
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,360
right?

134
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,320
The implied volatility should be in line with the realized to some degree.

135
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,560
Yeah. And then, you know, and we see that here, right? And it's not,

136
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,060
this is not just a phenomenon with Tesla, it's a phenomenon with any stock.

137
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,160
I need to change it at the top there. Oh, yeah. Okay. It's a phenomenon. Here,

138
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,940
you know what? We'll just keep Tesla here, actually, for now.

139
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,500
You have to check the box. Right? It's not just a phenomenon with Tesla,

140
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,480
this is a phenomenon with any stock. And it makes sense why. Right? Like,

141
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,960
we really,

142
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,780
the reason we pause here is to understand why this IVRV spread sort of does this

143
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,960
thing where one will be higher than the other,

144
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,300
then they come back together and then one will be higher than the other and they

145
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,100
come back together. Now it's not like they move exactly like that,

146
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,620
but as you can see on this graph, it kind of does. Right? So when we, when we,

147
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,800
you know, we try to model the volatility, right?

148
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,460
And we look at a whole bunch of different models to try to forecast what the volatility

149
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,540
of Tesla will be in the future. Right? And if we think,

150
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,180
if we really think about this,

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,440
forecasting volatility is very similar to forecasting the temperature. Okay.

152
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,800
Today's temperature is going to be similar to tomorrow's temperature. Okay.

153
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,360
And the same,

154
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,240
the same thing happens in the volatility space and the option space.

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,940
Okay.

156
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:56,370
Forecast. So, so when we look at our forecast of vol, right,

157
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,050
our forecast for the next 30 days going forward, we think it's going to be 77%.

158
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,070
Okay. And, and this forecast is taking into consideration, well,

159
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,490
the mean reversion of volatility, right?

160
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,790
How up moves are different than down moves in volatility. Right?

161
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,050
And so we have a 77% forecast for the next 30 days,

162
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,490
yet the options are implying a 95%. Right? So this is too big. Okay. So that,

163
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,970
that is our analysis right now with Tesla. Option volatility,

164
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,030
options in general are too expensive.

165
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,570
Okay. Okay. So, and, and just a, just a quick SKU analysis here for you guys.

166
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,020
You can see that the out of the money calls are still crazy bit.

167
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,680
And I actually,

168
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:49,150
Steven had a fantastic point about how SKU should actually change. Okay.

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,750
Think about it like this. You are in the S&P 500 now. When stocks sell off,

170
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,100
well, the ETFs have to unload the shares.

171
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,880
That's going to drive down the price of the shares.

172
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,220
So we should now see put SKU, not call SKU, right?

173
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,740
But we're still seeing this call SKU.

174
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,480
And what Steve's looking into is selling a risk reversal,

175
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,180
selling those out of the money calls,

176
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,840
buying an out of the money put and hedging the shares. Okay.

177
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,400
So if you guys want to learn more about that, please reach out to Steve.

178
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,540
He's got a really good analysis for you. Yeah. So Jared has a good point here.

179
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,360
He's like, what about the influx of share purchases from fund managers on 21st?

180
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,940
Yes. So that's already going to be priced in, right? If we think about it,

181
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:40,040
Jared, it's like Tesla went from $300 billion to $600 billion on the news,

182
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,020
right? Or $350 billion to $600 billion just on the news, right?

183
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,460
And we can see this. So one beautiful thing that we have is data, right?

184
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,680
So we can actually say, okay, well,

185
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,820
what happened when other stocks were included? CRM, Yahoo,

186
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,880
what happened when these stocks got included into the index?

187
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,540
And you're going to see that on the announcement, right? Well,

188
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,280
everyone is going to be like,

189
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,070
this thing is going to be included into the market.

190
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,880
I should buy it before all these funds have to buy it. Right.

191
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,600
And so what happens is we start bidding up the price, bidding up the price,

192
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,740
bidding up the price. I'm going to hold Tesla.

193
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,300
Think about it from the trader's perspective. I'm going to hold Tesla. Okay.

194
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,520
I'm just going to rise. And now Sean comes in and says, I need Tesla.

195
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,860
I need Tesla shares. So now I'm going to provide you liquidity.

196
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,280
I'm going to sell, I'm going to sell, I'm going to sell, unload,

197
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,280
unload everything to Sean. Right. So that's what,

198
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,380
that's what it means by being baked in. Okay. Right. Like, uh,

199
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,640
and another way you could think of it,

200
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,680
it's maybe not as good of an example with where you went with it, but, uh,

201
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,720
let's go back to the weather example for a second. Right.

202
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,500
So today's weather is a good indicator of tomorrow's weather. Right. You know,

203
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,500
it was sunny today. It'd probably be sunny tomorrow, but let's say there,

204
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,200
you know, there was a huge hurricane down. We're in Toronto.

205
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,380
So let's say in down South,

206
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,140
there was like a huge hurricane and it's moving North tends to happen.

207
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,900
We usually get the tail end of hurricanes that happen like Florida,

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,080
for example. Well, if that hurricane, you know, starts arriving tomorrow,

209
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,270
the weatherman is going to think that there's rain tomorrow and we're going to be

210
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,290
aware of it. Everyone's gonna be aware of it.

211
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,130
And the forecast for tomorrow's weather will now incorporate the fact that there's

212
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,650
that impending big thing coming.

213
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,990
And also I was actually talking with Marcos about this yesterday.

214
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,690
I don't know if he wants to keep a secret,

215
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,410
so I'm not going to say it on the live,

216
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,710
but Marcos has some really good idea about positioning,

217
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,950
how funds are going to be basically positioning different positioning their equity

218
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,850
book. Now the S&P 500, how that's going to be positioned going forward.

219
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,090
And you know, there might be some other trades available.

220
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,110
So if you guys want to reach out to Marcos as well,

221
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,210
he's got some really cool structuring ideas that he's working on.

222
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
Let me just make sure we got some of the questions here.

223
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,540
So Jared, really good point. I actually don't have an answer for that,

224
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,560
but I did see a really good YouTube video on it recently.

225
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,260
It's actually on chat with traders. I really like this guy's name.

226
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,030
I can't remember his name now.

227
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,710
Something Narang. Oh yeah. Yeah. Your buddy. Yeah. I don't know.

228
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,770
I can't remember his first name. I actually saw that online. Rishi Narang.

229
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,850
It just came out two days ago. Check it out. Okay. It's actually,

230
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,330
he talks about this stuff and Marcos,

231
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,590
you're actually going to really like that video.

232
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,990
He talks exactly about what we were chatting about last night.

233
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,020
Okay. So anyways, overall, we want to be selling options.

234
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,390
We think they're overpriced now. That's great. Unfortunately,

235
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,510
we can't just say, okay, well, we're going to, we're going to sell options.

236
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,590
We actually need to go and do it.

237
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,390
And how do we structure the trade and express our view? Okay.

238
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:04,040
So let's open up thinkorswim. So just to clarify, guys, we want to sell vol.

239
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,940
And what's our view? Like, what do we think is going to happen?

240
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,460
Is realized vol going to be low? Is IV going to come down?

241
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,460
What do we think is going to happen?

242
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,060
We think that implied volatility is going to drop down to our forecast. Okay.

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,380
It's going to drop down to about 77%, which is also, you know,

244
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,620
inside this quantile, right? Somewhere just inside this quantile,

245
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,780
we think vol is going to drop. And actually in the long run,

246
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,840
I think vol is going to drop quite a bit down to 60,

247
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,040
but that's for a different day.

248
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:34,740
Okay.

249
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,080
Here's our, here's our GME guys.

250
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,190
Yeah. Here's our GME, right? If vol drops, what do I have it stressed to?

251
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:56,120
We have a stress to the negative 30% here, but we'll see tomorrow. Anyways,

252
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,880
we should, we should all be good tomorrow. Assuming it hangs above 14, 14, 25.

253
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,470
We're good guys. We're good. Too much stress.

254
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,990
Too much panic going on in the group.

255
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay. Jared had a good question. He's saying,

256
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,020
I think Tesla could hit 800 by the 21st.

257
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,960
I assume you have to Delta hedge to offset that risk. Jared,

258
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,960
if it actually moves 800, I don't know what I'm going to do. Okay.

259
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,800
If it does go to 800, I'm going to be very upset. That being said,

260
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,000
if it does keep moving, I am going to have to keep hedging my shares,

261
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,740
but obviously from my position I have on, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be,

262
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,080
I wouldn't be short vol if I thought I was going to 100, 800.

263
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,800
I really hope that that's not the case, Jared.

264
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,890
Okay. So how do we do this? Well, a couple of things guys,

265
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,650
which we actually chatted about this on our live yesterday with GME that if we look

266
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,110
at Tesla, okay, actually I sold the February. So let's go back to February.

267
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,230
If we look here, we can't sell an at the money option here.

268
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,470
We could sell an at the money option here, but it's not neutral.

269
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:11,980
It's not neutral in direction and at the money option here is 60 Delta minus 40

270
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,660
Delta, right? So we're actually short, sorry,

271
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
we're in short 60 Delta and long 40 Delta here.

272
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,800
We're actually short 20 Deltas and we can just take a look here guys.

273
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,620
And that was, that was a, if you guys weren't on our live last night,

274
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,300
that was because of the volatility of the stock.

275
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,340
High volatility stocks usually have Deltas above spot price.

276
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,980
So we actually want this thing to go down at inception. Okay.

277
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,840
So if you're going to sell a straddle here and you want to be neutral in direction,

278
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,580
you can't just sell them at the money. Okay.

279
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,860
You'd actually have to go up in price,

280
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,020
right? Something like, let's say 690. Okay. And now we're,

281
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,790
we are a Delta neutral. Okay. Now the beauty of the options is you can do,

282
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,350
if you want to be short Vega, you can structure lots of trades, tons of trades.

283
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,950
So in this case, right,

284
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,970
the way I structured it was actually a Delta 40 strangle.

285
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,030
So let's price it out.

286
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,020
Oh no.

287
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,970
Dude. Why am I? Why is that? It's not even. Good job. Oh,

288
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,730
it's this cronium thing. Does anyone know how to get rid of chromium? It's a,

289
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,740
it's a, I think it's a virus, eh? Yeah. Yeah. You have a virus. I don't know.

290
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,250
Wow. This is the first time. What the fuck? Wow. Guys.

291
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,790
I actually can't believe this brand new Mac breaking down live stream.

292
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,950
Short Apple. Okay. So we got the new M1 chip now.

293
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,070
Tico will tell you all about it.

294
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,480
So I decided to put on a Delta 40 strangle. So this is the position I have on,

295
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,140
but actually I think in this example,

296
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,660
because we're going to be talking about strangles versus straddles,

297
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,740
I'm going to go a little bit wider just so you guys can,

298
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,600
can really grasp the point. So we're going to do a Delta 25 strangle.

299
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,380
Some good questions in there. I think chromium is a virus. Yeah.

300
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,740
Koa just looked it up. Come on, Koa. Don't scare me like that mid-live, dude.

301
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,670
Okay. So let's look at the strangle here, guys.

302
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,210
So here is our Delta neutral strangle.

303
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,540
Now we are taught that this is more safe. Okay.

304
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,740
This is more safe than a straddle. Now I think really to understand this,

305
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,620
we need to actually look at it from the long side.

306
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,180
Okay. We need to look at this from the long side. So here's our straddle,

307
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,580
right? Now here's our strangle because we're out of the money. Okay.

308
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,620
And this is really important guys, because we're over the money on a strangle,

309
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,300
you're more sensitive to implied volatility. Okay.

310
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,720
So we are a lot more sensitive to implied volatility. And Jared, you probably,

311
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,260
you know, maybe thought about this as well, just because, you know,

312
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,920
a tasty trade hasn't put, you know, at least in my mind,

313
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,740
when I was first starting out, that strangles are safer,

314
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,460
but let's really think about this. Okay. Well,

315
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,680
what do they reduce your exposure to that makes them say it's safer range,

316
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,370
right? The range, right? It's like, okay. Our range is bigger, right?

317
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,230
And our break evens are bigger. So therefore it's safer.

318
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,430
And that's a really good, really good point there, Sean.

319
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,040
But the actual fact guys is that think about it like this. Okay.

320
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,480
I want you guys to think about it in terms of Delta.

321
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,320
What is going to give you more leverage on a 10% stock move and in the money option

322
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,880
or an out of the money option, right? Well,

323
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,780
that out of the money option is going to go from 5 cents to 5 bucks, right?

324
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,580
And the same goes for implied volatility. If implied volatility increases,

325
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,040
we actually add a second derivative, okay? A second order Greek,

326
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,540
and that's called, it kills me to say it, VOMA, okay?

327
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,360
What it means is as implied volatility increases,

328
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,320
the wings actually increase faster. Okay. Just like,

329
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,620
you know how our Delta guys for our directional bet, right? The wings.

330
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,580
So let's look at one option here just so we can really understand this thoroughly.

331
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,880
I think it's so, so important.

332
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,260
Yeah. We're going to go for a, we're going to look at this 38 day option.

333
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,610
The worst lag this computer has ever experienced. Ever. I can't believe this.

334
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:36,120
It's crazy. Oh my God. Okay. Let's look at this option here guys. Okay.

335
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,720
At first. Okay. Let's take a look here.

336
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,720
So at first we don't have a lot of Delta exposure. Okay. Look at our Delta,

337
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,680
right? It's a hundred. It's a hundred Delta. Look at this exponential increase,

338
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:02,300
right? As we hit, as we hit the curve, it starts increasing rapidly, right?

339
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,800
And that's why they say Delta doesn't kill traders, Gamma does.

340
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,020
Because you sell this way out of the money option and everything is good until it

341
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,980
actually starts picking up, right?

342
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,100
You don't care what happens if the stock moves like this,

343
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,630
but once the stock gets going, you're in big trouble. Right? Okay.

344
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,170
And that's that, that's that, that increase in Delta. As you get to the wings,

345
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,290
volatility is going to be exactly the same. Okay. Let's take a look.

346
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,590
Let's increase vol here guys. Let's see what happens.

347
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,400
Do you hear that? Yeah, it's crazy. I don't know what it is.

348
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:48,690
Don't worry about it. Just keep chugging along. It must be the virus. Okay.

349
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,660
So let's increase vol here guys. Okay. Watch what happens here.

350
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:01,820
We're just going to increase vol 10 points. Okay. And look at this. We go from,

351
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,550
I guess it tests us so much, but so if we go,

352
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,760
let's look at our P&L at 1000 here. Okay. Or you can even add spot.

353
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:22,290
Too far out. Okay. Let's look at our P&L here at, uh, right here at 900. Okay.

354
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,830
When we increase vol, let's say 20 points. Okay.

355
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,470
We didn't take note of what it was before. Oh, okay. Sorry guys.

356
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,590
Give me one second here. We're going to go to add the money.

357
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:44,060
So at the money P&L, when vol increases 20 points is, what is our P&L?

358
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,800
Is $8,000. Okay. 8,000 bucks.

359
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,310
So by increasing vol 20 points, it's all good. That's the term. Logging out.

360
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,550
Okay.

361
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,310
By increasing the vol 20 points, this thing,

362
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:17,010
this thing increases 10 grand from an option that only cost us 10,000 to put on,

363
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,040
it's going to double up in value. And that's simply because of this,

364
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,700
this exposure to the wings, right? This VOMA, right?

365
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,000
The wings are gonna get more expensive a lot quicker. Okay.

366
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,400
So let's actually go back here and show this in real time. So watch this guys.

367
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,550
Okay. I want you guys to take a look at this. So we're gonna do two things.

368
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,530
Okay. We're gonna look at one.

369
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,030
We are going to look at, um,

370
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,570
two different strategies. Okay. Two different strategies.

371
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,590
First is the straddle. Okay.

372
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:05,210
And our Vega exposure on the straddle is going to be 1,663.

373
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:14,710
You guys see that 1,663 and we're going to create a strangle with the exact same

374
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,610
Vega exposure.

375
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
So something to clarify, I think is we want exposure to Vega.

376
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,350
That's our number one thing, right?

377
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,370
Our view is that the level of implied volatility is going to decrease.

378
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,700
But I think like to understand the point,

379
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,550
we've got to go from the long side first. So here we have two positions.

380
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,210
They have the exact same Vega exposure. Okay. Exactly the same.

381
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:58,670
This one has 1,700 and this one has 1,650. So $50 difference.

382
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:06,150
Now let's increase implied volatility by 25 points. Okay.

383
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,170
And we're going to go a little bit much here just to, to, to really,

384
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:20,000
to really express the point. Okay. So we paid $16,500 for this position. Okay.

385
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,860
$165, 10 lots, 16,000, sorry, $165,000 for this position.

386
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:38,500
And we made 40 grand. So we paid 165 grand and we made $40,000 on 25% increase.

387
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,740
Okay. Now let's look at the strata of the strength.

388
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:53,060
We go, we pay a 14 times 52 is 50,020 is 70,

389
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:01,820
we pay $70,000 for this position and we make $43,000. Okay. We pay 70 grand,

390
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,090
we make 43. That is more than 50% of our,

391
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,460
more than 50% increase when the other one only made 25%. Right.

392
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,840
That leverage factor. It's that as, as Vega increases, okay.

393
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,620
The wings actually increase quicker. Okay. And that's called,

394
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,520
there's a third derivative called VOMA or second derivative called VOMA higher derivative.

395
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,670
So let's go back to our position.

396
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,060
So why do we want to go and sell the strangle instead? Well,

397
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,180
for that exact reason,

398
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,550
for that exact reason, if we're right, okay,

399
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,380
we are going to get the most exposure. Okay. If we're right,

400
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,720
as Vega comes down, the wings are going to come down even quicker, right?

401
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,420
And that's what we want the exposure to is that we are taking on more leverage.

402
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,740
Okay. We're taking on more leverage.

403
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,130
We're taking on more sensitivity to that implied volatility. Okay.

404
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,600
So that's why you would choose a strangle over a strata is if,

405
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,270
do you want more, do you want more risk? Right.

406
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,730
Do you want more exposure to that, to that, that decrease in volatility?

407
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:40,290
And there's actually another reason why as well, is that volatility inside the,

408
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,710
the, the wings is going to remain constant Vega inside the, the, the strikes,

409
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,570
sorry, is going to remain constant.

410
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,810
So those are the reasons why we're taking the short strangle versus the short straddle.

411
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,310
Let's say you decide that a strangle is the way to go.

412
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,850
You understand why you're taking it. How far, how wide do you make it? Yeah.

413
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,870
That's a really good point, right? So think about it like this guys.

414
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,890
So a lot of the times we need to think in terms of dollar gain versus implied vol

415
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,090
gain, right? Example,

416
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,820
you could sell a way out of the money option on Tesla at 120 eyeball for a dollar,

417
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,880
right? And if vol drops, you gain a dollar, or you can get more Vega exposure.

418
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,500
When vol drops, you make quite a bit of money.

419
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,860
So you always have a trade-off between implied vol versus dollar, right?

420
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,600
So implied vol gain versus dollar gain.

421
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,300
I usually like to go between Delta 40 and Delta 30 just because, well, one,

422
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,640
I get a little bit, a little bit sensitivity to that, that third order Greek,

423
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,020
right? If I'm right.

424
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,360
And then also because as long as the stock stays within that,

425
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,100
within those strikes, I'm going to have the same Vega exposure throughout,

426
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,870
right? Yeah. Steve. So the Vega doesn't remain constant.

427
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,890
It actually changes just like how Delta changes, right? Vega changes as well.

428
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,670
And it actually never changes at the money. It only changes in the wings.

429
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,490
Yeah. Jerry, I used up all my VP today, man. I couldn't, uh,

430
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,690
I couldn't get any more Tesla on. And uh, I'm sure for you in the state,

431
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,030
do you guys get portfolio margin in Canada? We don't.

432
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:37,280
So these things per lot cost me 50, 50 K to put on Terrence saying,

433
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,520
does making this an IC pose the Vega? Yeah, it does. Right. Unfortunately,

434
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,510
you know, you go out and buy the wings here, right? Think of it like this guys,

435
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,030
right? If we're looking at the Vega, Theta Vega, right? Here's our Vega.

436
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,790
So we're selling, let's say 84 Vega here, or let's say we're selling,

437
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,210
let's say 80 Vega on the wings. And then we're going to buy out,

438
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,730
they're buying 40 Vega, right? So if you want the same exposure,

439
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,490
you just need to increase your position.

440
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,020
But now you have the third order Greeks working against you.

441
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,990
When implied vol drops, guess what's happening?

442
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,390
Your wings are dropping quicker.

443
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,040
Your wings are dropping quicker. But if you go really far out, well,

444
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,320
now we're talking the dollar terms that it's dropping. Doesn't really matter.

445
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,800
Right? Think about it like this. Let's imagine we had,

446
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,040
let's say a 3000 strike and you bought those wings. Well, sure.

447
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,500
Implied vol is going to drop like crazy,

448
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,500
but you're going from 10 cents to zero while you're making $20 at the money,

449
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,220
right?

450
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,900
So we're always in that trade-off between dollar return and implied vol return.

451
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Yeah. Right. Right. And you know,

452
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,620
that's why sometimes you look at the skew for example,

453
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,100
and you'll see like way out of the money calls are so bid and it's like,

454
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,440
it's not worth our time to go, you know? It's like your commissions slippage,

455
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,240
how much are you going to make here? 10 cents? Yeah. You know,

456
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,820
we could always sell those way out of the money Delta two options for 300% implied

457
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,950
vol to make two cents. It's not worth it. Not worth it.

458
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,360
So wow, that was a, I didn't realize I ranted that hard. Wow.

459
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,730
Any questions guys? Yeah. Jared saying,

460
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,570
how does the vol drop effect of vertical? Depends where you place it. Right?

461
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,310
Check this out. Jared.

462
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,870
Let's say we're looking at Tesla. We'll do the 38 day.

463
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,000
If I'm buying a digital, right? If I'm buying a digital here, let's say one,

464
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:55,460
a little bit of lag today. Okay. So here's my digital.

465
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,280
Okay. Well changing the vol is not going to do anything.

466
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:17,850
It's not really going to do anything because I got no Vega. I got no Vega.

467
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,130
My Vega is eight bucks, but watch this. Let's see what we do.

468
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,760
This at the money wide vertical,

469
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,750
but all of a sudden I got a ton of Vega now, right? Well,

470
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,510
I got six times more Vega. Okay.

471
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,550
So depending on where the option is placed is really going to depend.

472
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,810
So Coa says, why not sell the December 24th vol should drop.

473
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,680
So basically how'd you pick your expiry? Yep. That's a really good point. Cool.

474
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,660
Let's go back to the term.

475
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,270
Marcos really upset right now because he doesn't like the, uh,

476
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,530
I actually think it might be less than 30 minutes. Yeah. Double check it.

477
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,740
And he's like, I told you, I told you guys, I told you guys.

478
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,090
And then we have one last question for Marcos there that I think is really good

479
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,740
as well. Okay. So, um, so,

480
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:35,530
um, I wanted exposure to Vega. Okay. I wanted exposure to if implied vol drops,

481
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,830
I don't really have gamma. The stock moves up 10% stock moves down 20%.

482
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:44,710
It doesn't really matter too much. What matters is the level of implied vol,

483
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:48,030
especially for a long graded option. And that's what I really cared about.

484
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:57,180
Okay. Okay. So what we have is, uh, what we have is what we have is the width.

485
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,250
Okay.

486
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,930
I'm going to show you this and I'm going to break it down for you in more in depth.

487
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,190
Okay.

488
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:05,970
It's not testing.

489
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,840
Yes. So longer dated. Okay.

490
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,770
Longer dated means more sensitive to the implied volatility level. Okay.

491
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,220
When shorter dated means more sensitive to the realized vol. So check this out.

492
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:34,560
I think that this option is going to drop 15 handles. Well,

493
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,720
let's take a look at our Vega. Let's just go to the option calculator, right?

494
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,830
Okay. Let's price an option at TECO where let's say we're looking at the, uh,

495
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,720
at the February options. Okay.

496
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:57,950
And let's look at our Vega or watch this TECO as we get closer to expiration,

497
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,430
right? So here we are now, as we get closer to expiration, our Vega drops.

498
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,520
So our sensitivity to implied vol drops, but look at the opposite,

499
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,570
look what happens on the opposite side. Okay.

500
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:24,020
Our sensitivity to the actual movement of the stock increases. So we have this,

501
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,900
uh, we have this trade off here and I was just talking to Ned about it.

502
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,550
Near dated stuff.

503
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:35,180
We are concerned about that sensitivity to the underlying stock.

504
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,410
Is it going to move or is it not going to move? If it doesn't move,

505
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,590
we don't care about implied vol as long as it doesn't move.

506
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,110
But for the longer dated stuff,

507
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:51,420
it can move all at once as long as implied vol drops or it increases from the long

508
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,670
side. Okay. So that's your trade off there, right? There's no better,

509
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,030
there's no better here. It's what do you think is going to happen?

510
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,470
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks Jared.

511
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:14,460
We should make a PA terminal keyboard. We should. That'd be cool. Okay. Uh,

512
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,680
just answer Marco's question here. That was really good as well.

513
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,580
Where are we wrong? So, uh, Marcos, are you saying,

514
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,610
when do we say we're wrong or how can this be a bad trade? I guess,

515
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,330
I guess they're both, they're both one in the same.

516
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,840
So, um, this is really tough, right?

517
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,420
This is really tough because as implied vol increases,

518
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,110
I'm going to be more and more, you know,

519
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,270
thinking this thing is going to be great.

520
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,770
This thing I should be selling more and more just like today, right?

521
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:51,920
I was already in a position implied vol increased and I sold some more. Um,

522
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,560
so where I'm going to be wrong is if the stock blows out, if it moves,

523
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,160
let's say 15%, I'm wrong. I have to close out the position.

524
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,840
I have to keep hedging. My, my, my Vegas is going to dry up.

525
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,080
So if we go back to the analyze tab,

526
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,060
I'm just going to do a, not when it hits 800, if it hits 800,

527
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,760
we can't be wishing that into existence, man, you Tico, you,

528
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,960
you basically influenced Jared to think this thing's going to 800.

529
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,740
Now what's going on here, guys,

530
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,820
you guys can hold off seeing 800 for a couple of months. Come on, guys.

531
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,120
Let us make our money. Then you make your money. Exactly. Come on, guys.

532
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,820
We're Tesla bros. Now, by the way, Jared, you're typing to all panelists.

533
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,460
So if you want everyone else to see your message,

534
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,700
you do all panelists and attendees.

535
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,740
Um, Marcos. So one thing, one thing that we, uh,

536
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,700
that we note is that realized vol and implied vol are correlated. Remember how,

537
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,540
like we say to implied vols up,

538
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,400
realized vol comes or from realized vol down implied vol comes down with one of

539
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,420
the two, they, the spread closes. So I'm going to be wrong, right?

540
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,110
If this thing, let's say moves a lot closer to my break.

541
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,310
Even I got basically my Vega starts to run dry, right? My,

542
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,690
I start to lose a ton of Vega out here, right. Versus when it was over here.

543
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,640
Right. I lose a thousand Vegas down here. And at that point, I got to say,

544
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,900
okay, I'm wrong, right? I don't have a position on anymore.

545
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,530
That really expresses my view, right? Sure. I'm short Vega, but I'm,

546
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,090
I have a ton of risk on, and so I'm going to have to close out the position.

547
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,070
Okay. I was saying, so if all does not drop in time goes by, well,

548
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,610
if all doesn't drop in time goes, okay. I see what you're saying.

549
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,760
So that's going to be a really hard one because like,

550
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,560
if we look at our silver position, right.

551
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,900
We had the position on for like two months and then it took two months for it to

552
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,780
pay off. Right. And sure. It was a great return,

553
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,240
but was it the best use of our capital?

554
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,820
Because it took two months to take to really come through.

555
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,380
And that's a really good, that's a really good point, Marcos.

556
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,600
And although I should have thought about this,

557
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,280
shouldn't have thought about that entering this trade.

558
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,850
I'm going to actually think a lot more about that after you mentioned it,

559
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,430
but that's a very good point, Marcos.

560
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:39,760
I hope everyone understood what Marco is saying is that if we do sell ball and what

561
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,500
if just nothing happens? Well, okay. Well, first off, right. First off,

562
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,090
if nothing happens, we're going to make a little bit of money,

563
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,730
but because our Vega, our theta is so low,

564
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,770
we're not going to make a lot of money and it could be a really bad use of capital.

565
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,410
Yeah. Unless it stays pinned at the current price and we hold it to expiration.

566
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,090
It'd be a huge winner. It'd be a huge winner. But it's also like,

567
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,920
it's also like our capital could have been somewhere else for so much that.

568
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:07,410
Okay.

569
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,260
So no more questions. If anyone has, sorry, if anyone has any more questions,

570
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,640
if not, there's no more questions. We will end the live here. By the way,

571
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,880
we had a great turnout tonight, everyone. Dave, good to see you. Joe.

572
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,920
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Really good. Leon. Leon and Lawrence. Lawrence, man.

573
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,680
And Mark. Hey, what's going on, Mark? Awesome.

574
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,680
Awesome. If I knew Mark was here, I would have, I would have really,

575
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,160
I would have done a whole PowerPoint.

576
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,660
Okay. So that will be the live for tonight, everyone.
