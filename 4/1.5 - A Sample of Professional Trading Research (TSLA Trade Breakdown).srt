1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
All right, guys. So in this live,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,080
we're going to be chatting about some of the research that I've been doing and then

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,220
also the trade that I've been doing as well.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,050
So I've actually shared this research with some portfolio managers that gave me

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,070
feedback. And funny enough,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,170
they actually decided to initiate the trade as well. So it's, you know, it's,

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,250
it's worth the look for you guys to see like what's happening on the back end.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,650
Sometimes, you know, some of the more advanced trade,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,370
sometimes I might not share because, you know, for multiple different reasons.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,030
So, you know, just going to give you guys some insight into that.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,950
So before we actually get into the research,

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,990
I need to do an exercise with you guys, just so you guys can fully understand.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,710
Is SteveBee on the call as well, Sean? I believe so. Okay,

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,890
because I shared with him the research and this is one of the questions he had.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,150
So I think it's good that we start with this.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,780
So I'm going to draw a graph here. Okay. And on the Y on the X axis,

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,510
we're going to have age. Okay, so this is age of a person. Okay.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,780
And on the Y axis, we're going to have frequency. Now,

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,180
I was thinking frequency of, of wakeboarding. But what do you guys think? Like,

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,520
maybe, so something, something that people do when they're young,

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,420
not very often, when they're like 20s, very, very often.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,240
And then when they're like 60, 70, not very often at all. Any ideas there,

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,480
Sean? Go to the club. Okay, nice. So it looks, so the distribution. Well,

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,180
you're saying there's one year olds at the club with this distribution? Okay,

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,750
hold on, hold on. Well,

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,740
because I actually have like the actual one that I wanted to show you guys already

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,940
pre-made. So I'm just gonna, okay, so something that. Yeah.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,880
Okay. It looks like this.

29
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,630
Okay, where I think that's a really good one, Sean.

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,270
So this is let's say 70 years old. We're drinking in general, you know? Yeah,

31
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,050
drinking, right. These are the people drinking in grade eight.

32
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,750
That was you and I. We'll call this 30.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,250
Okay, and here we have the frequency. Now, when we look at this distribution.

34
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,350
Okay, what are some things that we notice about it?

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,900
What are you noticing about this one, Sean?

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,480
Like compared to all the other distributions that we've shown?

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,190
It's a lot lumpier. Perfect. Right? It's a lot lumpier. Right?

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,550
There's like this, this bump here.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,620
And then there's like, like this bump over here. Okay,

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,100
like this bump over here. Right? It's a lot lumpier.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,860
And so this is called structure. Right? This distribution has structure.

42
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,790
And what this actually tells us is that there's different groups here. Okay,

43
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,930
there's different groups. So I'm now going to show you something.

44
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,510
And this should, this should all like make sense now. Okay.

45
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,810
So just take a look at this. We see the groups. We see like this.

46
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,950
There's these weird lumps. Right.

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,930
And what this basically telling us is that there's different distributions inside

48
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,590
this. Okay. So let me. Yeah.

49
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,170
Like there's probably a trait that makes all the people on the left more likely

50
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,550
to drink at age 13. Exactly. Exactly. So if I share my screen again.

51
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,980
Right. So if we, if we took that distribution and like looked inside of it,

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,800
we might see something like this. Right. Well, okay.

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,980
There's a little bit of a lump here. Let's say like it's a little lumpy.

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,880
And that could be because we have an underlying. Distribute.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,780
We have different groups, right? In this case, we have the male.

56
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,160
Who looks like drinking much more frequently. Then let's say the females.

57
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,380
Okay. So this is called a structure and in trading.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,070
If we can find the underlying structures. We can make lots of money. Right.

59
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,670
Just to, just to tie it back one more time to an earnings trade, let's say.

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,480
Okay. So let's say we're tying it back to an earnings trade.

61
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,130
Okay. When we dish and we graph all the earnings. All the earnings moves,

62
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,530
all the average earnings move for each stock.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,740
We might see a distribution that looks like this.

64
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,720
Sorry. Actually look like this.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,260
Okay. This is what we would see. So on the Y axis here, we have.

66
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,440
Size of the move.

67
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,130
I'm sorry. The X axis. We have frequency. My apologies. The Y axis here.

68
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:32,840
We have frequency. And on the X axis. We have. Size of the move. Okay.

69
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,310
Now, once we graph by, let's say sector. Okay. Let's say we say, okay, well,

70
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,790
let's take a look at the sectors.

71
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:49,130
What we might find that here is the consumer staple sector. And here.

72
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,490
Is the technology sector. And here.

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,550
Is the EV sector really, really skewed. And so now when we say, okay, well.

74
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,100
We have company XYZ coming up. Right.

75
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,700
We have company XYZ or let's say Tesla coming up. If we have Tesla earnings.

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,480
Well, we can say, okay, well, Tesla is part of the EV section.

77
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,920
So now we know that it's probably going to fall somewhere in this range.

78
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,760
It's unlikely going to fall somewhere in this range. And so that is.

79
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,260
The understanding of trying to understand the structure of the distribution and

80
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,970
finding the underlying groups. Okay. Any questions about that?

81
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,230
Because then we're going to move into the research.

82
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,720
Looks like we're okay.

83
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,260
Yeah. Okay. Good, good, good. Great. Great. Okay.

84
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,280
Let me get rid of this chat.

85
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,250
Yeah, I had the chat open, so you don't need to worry. Perfect. Perfect.

86
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,970
So here, here is, here's the research. So what I'm,

87
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,010
what I'm trying to do here is.

88
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,190
So just so you guys know how I came up with this trade idea.

89
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,450
I was listening to a podcast. It was actually the mark.

90
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,530
The mark F podcast I post in the group. Where towards the end,

91
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,890
for those of you that stuck towards the end. He said.

92
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,190
Tesla vault 75. Tesla one-year vault at 75.

93
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,190
And he was able to do some arbitrage with the, with the. Convertible bonds.

94
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,390
And I said to myself, Tesla vault 75. Right. So that was where the idea.

95
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,750
The idea spawned from was born from, right. It's just listening to a podcast.

96
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,820
Vault 75. It doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem right. So I said, okay, well,

97
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,360
let me, you know, So I looked into it a little bit more. I graphed it out,

98
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,260
right. I use the PA terminal graphed it out.

99
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,480
And I saw where we're implied vol was where it usually is. It's okay.

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
It's expensive. Right. It's expensive.

101
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,760
Now let's actually dive in and try to see, well, what is fair value here?

102
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,610
If it's too expensive. Well, then we'll obviously want to sell. Okay.

103
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,590
Spoiler alert.

104
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,680
So in this document, we're trying to. Evaluate it. Okay.

105
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,620
And it's currently trading at 75. But given my current estimate,

106
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,900
I think it's actually worth 55. Giving it a 20% premium. Okay.

107
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
And so we're using the data.

108
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm not gonna go into the nuances about like why I'm using, let's say.

109
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm not using all the data. I'm only using some of the data. But what we're,

110
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,160
but what we're basically using here is.

111
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,420
465.

112
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,140
Equities. Okay. We're looking at 465 equities in the universe.

113
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,330
And we're taking a snapshot of what they are right now. Okay. So for example,

114
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,010
The current market cap of Baba. Right.

115
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,300
The current market cap of bank of America. Et cetera, et cetera.

116
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,400
And then we're also using in our data set, a time series of Tesla. Okay.

117
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,870
So time series, meaning the vols through time. Okay.

118
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,170
So any questions about the data so far? So we're, we're,

119
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,950
we're taking a snapshot. Of the data for each. So we're basically going to say,

120
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,610
okay, well,

121
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,500
what is Tesla trading at relative to what everything else is trading at? Okay.

122
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,860
Let's, let's try to build a model here. Right.

123
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,780
A way to think about it is if all stocks are volatile, well,

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Tesla's probably going to be volatile. We're also going to use the individual.

125
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,200
They're called target predictor variables.

126
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,610
We're going to use a variable to predict. The volatility, right.

127
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,910
Can we use a variable to predict the volatility of Baba and, and,

128
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,770
and bank of America and Bowen. And then if we can, well,

129
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:05,020
let's just use it to predict Tesla. Okay. Okay. So first thing to look at.

130
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,520
Okay. First thing to look at here, here is. IV 30 for Tesla.

131
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,800
Here is IV one year. And then here's the forward 31 year.

132
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,520
Let's not worry about that too much. Okay. So we can see here,

133
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,800
Tesla's trading at 75, 73.8.

134
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,610
And that's extremely bit. Okay. Let me just take away the IV 30.

135
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:35,170
That's extremely bit. Okay. Pre pre COVID. This whole, this whole scenario,

136
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,030
all the, all the WSB. It was trading at 45. Okay. 70 ball,

137
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,190
75 ball for a one-year option is extremely, extremely expensive. Okay.

138
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,730
You don't see that very often.

139
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,920
So I think my fans are going through the roof here. Okay. You don't,

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,900
you don't see that. Right. That's extremely, extremely expensive.

141
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,100
And I encourage you guys to go and look at a whole bunch of the stocks that you

142
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,620
like. And go check out the longer dated vols. Right. Even by do right now,

143
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,380
the longer dated vol is 60%. Tilray. Okay. Tilray is 95 is a hundred. Right.

144
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,740
And Tesla's in that range.

145
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,480
So it's just unbelievable how expensive this ball is.

146
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,600
And then, so what I also did here, and it's very important.

147
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,540
Is I graphed the contango. So you can graph it to contango in PA terminal.

148
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,050
Contango is basically how steep is that term structure? Okay.

149
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,610
How steep is that term structure? So if we, if we went on the PA terminal,

150
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,470
we would see something like this. Well,

151
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,250
we would see something that looks like this. Okay.

152
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,610
We would see something that looks like this.

153
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,460
The term structure would look like this. Okay. Where this is 55%. Right.

154
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,780
For the near dated implied volatility. And this is 75%.

155
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:14,260
For the far dated implied vol. Okay. So what the market is saying is,

156
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,120
is that as we get closer to expiration, volatility should decrease.

157
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,770
But here's the thing. Okay. Let me ask you guys this question.

158
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,400
If implied volatility is high. Okay.

159
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
Let's say implied volatility is extremely high.

160
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,220
What should the curve look like?

161
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,480
What should the curve look like? If implied vol is extremely high.

162
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,370
Anyone got the answer?

163
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,650
Inverted. Inverted. Exactly. Okay. It would look like this.

164
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:57,520
It would look like this. And what's the logic behind that, Jordan? Yep.

165
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,400
The logic is that the volatility is not going to last forever. Right.

166
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,660
It's going to imply a lot of volatility now. Volatility is mean reverting.

167
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,460
And so in the future, volatility will drop.

168
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,800
And we have lots of videos on this as well. If you guys want to go through our.

169
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,040
And like, you know, to, to just think about it logically, like, you know,

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,380
if we have like a big event happening,

171
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,430
you expect the market to correct price and see a big move now,

172
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,450
but that doesn't mean it's going to see the same size moves a year from now.

173
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,260
Right. The market's pretty efficient, right? So if something happens now,

174
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,160
we shouldn't see this huge tale of volatility for the next 10 years, right?

175
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,740
We should see it taper off and go back to some sort of mean or average volatility

176
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,300
for, for the asset. Exactly. Exactly. And I just, you know,

177
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,560
I encourage you guys to go look at GME vol during everything. Okay.

178
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,700
See how the vols look. So contango now if I have Ivy one year here, okay.

179
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:08,000
Ivy one year, what should this relationship look like? So this way. Okay. The,

180
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,980
the curve is going to get steeper. And this way it's going to get more.

181
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,910
Into contango. Right. Into normal. Right. Well, what should we see here?

182
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,820
What do you guys think? So as Ivy increases, what should happen?

183
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,770
What's it was Steve saying there down sloping to the right.

184
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:44,660
Okay. So as, okay. So, so. Yes. As Ivy gets higher. Okay.

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,540
We get more into backwardation. Okay. And as Ivy gets lower,

186
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,160
we get more into contango. Right.

187
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,920
And we should see a relationship that looks like this,

188
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,140
but right now Tesla is at the highest Ivy. Okay. One of the highest IVs.

189
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,320
And it's in contango. Okay.

190
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,200
So it would be like somewhere over here on this graph.

191
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,540
And if you scroll down a bit, you can get both graphs on the screen.

192
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,650
One second.

193
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,970
Right. So you can see that it's at the top of the range there for both graphs.

194
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:30,040
Right. But to this graph down here, what it did, what we did was, well,

195
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,660
we can't say we can't just plot contango and say, oh, well, it's steep.

196
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,690
You know, vol is expensive or it's low vol is cheap. We can't just do that.

197
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,490
Right.

198
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,190
And the reason we can't do that is because every time there's a lot of volatility,

199
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,300
well, there's going to be a lot of, a lot of backwardation. Right.

200
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,340
And every time there's no volatility, there's going to be a lot of contango.

201
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,200
So we can't just plot contango and say, oh, well, it's up here.

202
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,140
It's got to be expensive.

203
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,160
What we need to do is we need to divide it or normalize it by the level of implied

204
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,400
volatility. Okay. So we take contango,

205
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,480
we divide it by the level of implied volatility, right.

206
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,640
Because we should see that, you know, as implied volatility drops,

207
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,210
contango goes, starts to move into, into normality, right. Into contango. And,

208
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,050
but what we're seeing here. Okay. So once we do that, once we normalize it.

209
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:31,820
Okay. Which we have to do here, but we can see that we are at extreme,

210
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:40,600
at extreme highs, meaning implied vol is low. And contango is steep.

211
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,790
So that's a sign that maybe the back months are overpriced. Right.

212
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:58,530
It's extremely steep. Right. So it looks like this. When in reality,

213
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,330
it might look like this.

214
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,130
Okay. So that's what we're plotting there. And this being the back months,

215
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,450
this being the two year,

216
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,430
the one year options and this being the 30 day options. Okay.

217
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,390
Any questions there? Nope. We're all good so far. Okay.

218
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,060
Okay. So I was saying here, like, there's no surprise. Like it's obvious that,

219
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,680
that this is steep. Now as any good researcher, as any good trader,

220
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,420
you really want to understand what you're trading, right.

221
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,380
What the hell am I trading here?

222
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,540
So I really want to look more into this one eyeball one year. Right.

223
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,660
What is this implied volatility one year? Right. What does it look like?

224
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,980
What are the characteristics about it? And so I did a histogram of it. Okay.

225
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
You know, we have the frequency and we have the level of implied vol. Right.

226
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,380
So for example, level of a hundred didn't happen. Right.

227
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,960
But level of 70 or 75 happened actually quite frequently. Right.

228
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,020
And this could be a case that, well, if it happening quite frequently,

229
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,360
maybe that's the normal, you know, maybe that's the normal. Right.

230
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,280
And we're clearly seeing that here. Right.

231
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,090
We're clearly seeing that right here. Right. That's 75 vol. It's the norm,

232
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,690
but you can see when we graph this guys is that usually it's all the way down here.

233
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,050
Right. Usually it's at this 50 mark, which we're seeing this big hump.

234
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,720
And right now it's up here.

235
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,670
So we do some transformations and now we can see it extremely clearly. Okay.

236
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,560
We can clearly see these two humps. What do you mean by transformations,

237
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,320
Jordan? Yep. So we gaussianize.

238
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,180
So what that does is it basically tries to make these normal.

239
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,020
It tries to make these, this structure as normal as possible.

240
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,260
We give the inputs of, okay, well, what is the,

241
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,600
what is the general shape of it?

242
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,180
And then we use maximum likelihood and that shapes it to, you know, to, to,

243
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,520
to the parameters, to, to what we're, we're trying to make it look like. Cool.

244
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,330
And so here we have it. Okay. So now we have clearly, right? Like no one,

245
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,350
no one can say that there's not two humps here. Okay.

246
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,830
And so what that's telling us is that given what we were just talking about earlier,

247
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:28,340
right. Is that there might, there's definitely two groups. Right.

248
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,640
There's definitely two groups here.

249
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:41,850
Okay. And if we know, if we know that right now, Tesla given whatever,

250
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,210
imagine this group is like,

251
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,440
this group is March to June. Okay. Just like the, the, the months of the week.

252
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,660
Or sorry, the months of the year. And then this hump is July to Feb. Okay.

253
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,440
Just imagine that for a second. Well, we would, we could say that, well,

254
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,640
we're going into March.

255
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:16,740
So implied volatility should actually be around this 45 mark. Right.

256
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,280
If we can say that this ball is going to be part of this group,

257
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,170
we can increase our forecast drastically.

258
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,260
But if we could figure out what these two groups are, We'd be,

259
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,040
we'd make a ton of money. Right. And this, this happens in multiple fields.

260
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,830
It's not just in this, this is in a lot of different scenarios. Okay.

261
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,310
This happens to insurance, right. Or is he a smoker? Is he not smoker? Well,

262
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,590
given that we can make a distribution to distributions of life expectancy.

263
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:51,980
So.

264
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,090
Because I didn't have time. This research,

265
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,790
this research was done on Saturday or Sunday. Saturday, but, you know,

266
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,870
we had to, the terminal needs to get done as well.

267
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,010
So we didn't have a ton of time to, to really work on this.

268
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,330
And I thought the model that I built was good enough.

269
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,220
I didn't need to find out what these two groups were. Okay. But usually.

270
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,320
These two finding what these two groups are is very important.

271
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,680
Especially when they're so blatant like this.

272
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,140
I hope you don't have to eat those words. I know. Right. Okay.

273
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,260
So.

274
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,280
Yeah. So I was also saying here, like, usually I like to shrink the data.

275
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,640
Right. Which, which we just talked about, like shrinking it into the sector.

276
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,860
Right. So if let's say Goldman Sachs. Bank of America,

277
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,660
JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley all have an earnings implied move of 4%.

278
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,140
And then you have.

279
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,390
City group with a 10% implied move. Well, you want to shrink that. Right.

280
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,650
You want to shrink that back down to the average, to the sector. Right.

281
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,730
They do it a lot in baseball. Right. So.

282
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,460
I don't know exactly how it's done in baseball. I can't remember,

283
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,160
but they do a lot of this in baseball. I like what is your batting average?

284
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,720
And they would shrink your current, like,

285
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,230
if you want to know the batting average in the second half of the season, Well,

286
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,930
you would actually shrink your you're for the first half of the season,

287
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,650
you're batting average down to the average.

288
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,890
And you can do better by like shrinking it to the left handies or the size difference

289
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,870
or the size of the person, whatever it is, but it's very, very popular.

290
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,570
In gambling. Okay. So basically what I'm saying here is.

291
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,770
We can do a lot better, but, you know, given the time constraint,

292
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,510
give me what to put on trade tomorrow. You know, let's just make it happen.

293
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,050
And so what I did here was. So is everyone following along so far?

294
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,640
Did I put everyone to sleep yet? Oh, I think. I think everyone's so far. No,

295
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,060
no. A couple of questions, but we'll, we'll get to them at the end.

296
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,290
Okay. Good. Good. Okay. So let me zoom in here. If I zoom in on my screen,

297
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,730
Sean. Does it zoom in on your screen? Yep. All good.

298
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,660
Okay.

299
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,750
So here I have graphed the relationships between all our predictor variables.

300
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Okay. So let's just quickly go back up to the predictor variables. Okay. So.

301
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,680
So here, for example, we are trying to forecast this one right here.

302
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,860
IV one year. Is what we're trying to forecast for given the data.

303
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,620
Can we build a relationship? Can we given the data,

304
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,560
can we find a relationship here? So we're trying to predict this IV one year.

305
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,080
And we might say, okay, well,

306
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,740
does the average option volume predict the one year?

307
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
So I'm going to ask you guys this question here. I want to,

308
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,440
I want to hear what you guys say.

309
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,820
What is the relationship between market cap. And implied volatility.

310
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,900
What is the relationship between market cap and implied volatility.

311
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,980
Inverse. Tell me more. What does that mean? What does that mean?

312
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,970
What does that mean? Highest market cap, less implied vol. Why, why would that,

313
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:27,650
why would that be the case? More difficult to move. Who said that one? Marcos.

314
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:36,820
Oh, man, my guy. My guy. So. Good try, Jacob. We need it. He said the opposite.

315
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,260
No, no, no. He was just a little late to the party. Okay. Okay. So, so Marcos.

316
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,610
So here's Ivy one year. Okay. And here's a market cap. So we go down here.

317
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,550
And it's right here. So this is the, this is the graph right here, Marcos.

318
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,850
So you can see here, if we graphed all those 465 stocks. Right.

319
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,690
We can see that. The larger or the smaller, the market cap.

320
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,570
The more of the implied volatility.

321
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,550
The lower the market cap or the bigger the market cap.

322
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:10,510
The lower the implied volatility. Right. So, but before we see the data.

323
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,510
We want to be able to say, we want to be like, why would we see this? Okay.

324
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,790
So let's do another one. Let's do another one. Implied volatility 30 day.

325
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,590
And implied volatility one year.

326
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,260
What's the relationship.

327
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,470
Co is saying inverse. Inverse. Co-op.

328
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,400
Does anyone want to agree or disagree with co-op?

329
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,920
Marcos and Steve disagree. Guys never bet against co-op. Don't you guys.

330
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,780
Don't you guys know this? Okay. You guys, you guys are right. It is.

331
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,720
There is a relate a positive relationship, right?

332
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,600
If implied volatility 30 goes up. So should the implied volatility one year.

333
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,380
And so we can see that right here. Right. It's, it's fairly obvious. Okay.

334
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,200
It's fairly obvious. Now keep in mind guys for this data, I'm not using Tesla.

335
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,070
I'm not using Tesla because that's going to contaminate the data. Okay.

336
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,980
We'll do one more. We'll do. Okay. Here's a good one. Okay. Here's a good one.

337
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,380
Let's see who gets this one.

338
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,240
Wait, actually hold on. Let me just see super quick. If it's. Okay.

339
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
The skew.

340
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:43,890
And the implied volatility 30 day. One year. So the level. The long-term skew.

341
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,450
Okay. The long-term skew versus. The implied volatility one year.

342
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,280
Higher skew lower IB. Okay. Was that one, Steve? Yeah.

343
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,620
You saw this one already. Cheater.

344
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:11,320
We should abandon. So it is right. So what we see here, right.

345
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,020
And what we should see is that companies that have high skew.

346
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,920
Are usually companies like biotechs.

347
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,200
They're usually companies that like are on this crazy runs. They're till rate,

348
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,930
they're game stop. Companies that have. Or companies have a lot of put skew.

349
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,910
Are companies like Walmart or companies like target or companies like.

350
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,380
Procter and gamble. Where the risk is to the downside. Not to the upside.

351
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,100
Johnson and Johnson. Has no risk to the upside. Okay.

352
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,780
So we can see that right here. Slope infinity, which is the long-term slope.

353
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,750
And the Ivy one year. Okay. So the more. The more calls.

354
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,090
The more types of calls are relative to puts.

355
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,470
Then the more, the higher, the implied volatility is. Okay.

356
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,950
So what we are just going to quickly take a look at our data set here.

357
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,610
Implied volatility one year. The Ivy 30 day is a good predictor. Okay.

358
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,290
The slope is the skews, a good predictor.

359
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,660
The market cap is a good predictor. Okay. Also. Contango.

360
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,100
So there's groups here again. We can kind of see the groups here.

361
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,220
Now I didn't have time to look into these.

362
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,040
But you can clearly see that there are like a couple of groups here. Okay.

363
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,840
We don't have time to look into it, but anyways, it is, it is.

364
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,240
It is a little bit predictive given by the red line. Okay. Also.

365
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,640
Realized volatility. What's actually happening is a good predictor. And lastly,

366
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,320
the borrow cost is a slightly, slightly a good predictor as well. Okay.

367
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,440
How much it costs to borrow the stock. Right. Hi.

368
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,560
Stocks with high borrow would have a high implied vol stock with low borrow with

369
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,430
that low implied vol. Okay.

370
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,490
And so we run a quick regression model and we get this. Okay.

371
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,690
We get market caps, a really good predictor. Okay. The skews a good predictor.

372
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,850
The Ivy 30 script. Contango is realized vol and the oral rate.

373
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,050
So we put it into the computer.

374
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,450
The computer starts looking at it starts to build these models and says, okay,

375
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,070
Hey, you know what? I can actually predict the volatility given these inputs.

376
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,350
But this one here, the volatility of volatility. That wasn't very,

377
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,630
that wasn't very, I didn't really use it when I was trying to predict it.

378
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,290
I didn't really use it. So I said, okay, great.

379
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,120
So what we did now.

380
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,340
Okay.

381
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,700
So now. What we did was we graphed it. We graphed hours. Okay. So now we said,

382
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,370
okay, okay. Model. Okay. Computer. Here is. All the information we have.

383
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:06,660
I want you to go and predict what. You think the forecast is. Okay.

384
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,980
I want you to go and predict here. Here's the, here's the model.

385
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,660
I want you to go and predict Boeing's or Boeing's implied vol one year.

386
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,920
I want you to go predict.

387
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,030
Apple's implied vol one year. Okay. So that's what we did.

388
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:26,260
And so this is what the graph looks like. Okay. So on the, on the X axis here.

389
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,080
We took, we took the log of it.

390
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,280
There's reasons why I did that, but I took the log of it.

391
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,060
And we can see here that.

392
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:44,280
It predicts very well. Okay. Now, obviously it's seen the data. Right.

393
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,140
It's seen the data.

394
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,020
But what we're trying to do is we're just trying to explain it.

395
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,420
We're trying to explain this implied vol one year. Okay.

396
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,480
And this is an extremely good, right. This is saying, okay, well,

397
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,960
I can basically give you extremely good confidence.

398
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,840
If you give me this information. Right. Which we just talked about up here.

399
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,700
Okay. If you can give me this information. I can predict.

400
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,160
What the implied volatility is going to be with really good accuracy.

401
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,220
And so. So what do we do? Well, now we gave the model unseen data.

402
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,850
We gave the model Tesla. We said, okay, model. Here's Tesla.

403
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,210
Here's Tesla's information. What do you got for us?

404
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,200
And this is what it's got for us. Okay.

405
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,400
So what it's got for us is that if we were to.

406
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:44,430
First of the forecast would be 54%. 54% for the one year. Okay. Now,

407
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,870
if I were to graph where this was. On this graph,

408
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,630
it would be right at the center point here. Okay.

409
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,650
This would be our predicted value value on the green line. Okay.

410
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,130
See this little green, see the green line here.

411
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,610
This is what our model would predict.

412
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,830
However, it's all the way up here.

413
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,310
Okay. It's all the way up at the 75% mark. Right.

414
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,960
When our model is saying this should be at 54. Okay. And. You know, Stephen,

415
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,200
for example, obviously this looks really expensive. Now, Stephen, for example,

416
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,200
has this belief. And I agree with him here. That eventually.

417
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,580
So Tesla has a lot of calls to you, even in the longterm. It's not, it's not.

418
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,520
It was a lot steeper on Friday, but starting to come back down.

419
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,760
But Stephen has this idea that. It's going to completely invert eventually.

420
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,550
And if that was the case, right. If Stephen's right.

421
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,990
And I think he's going to be right here.

422
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:46,450
Then our model would actually predict a 51% implied vol. Right.

423
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,670
Because remember, skew went into this. Skew went into the model.

424
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,140
It would predict a 51% implied move of 51% volatility level.

425
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,000
And so, you know, obviously this is crazy expensive.

426
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,060
So you got to short this thing.

427
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,260
And so I did short this thing and I am short this thing through. A January,

428
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,160
2023. Okay. So actually two-year volatility. Straddle.

429
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,980
And let me show you guys what this P and L should look like.

430
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,330
So this is the big moment. Okay. You guys can see. So,

431
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,040
so this.

432
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,340
We're actually a little bit higher here. Just to show you guys for this.

433
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,340
I'll show you guys what I have on. So this is what I have on. Okay. Now,

434
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:09,570
if volatility were to drop. Okay. To the 54 mark. Oh, you have too many.

435
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,180
On a 10 lot. Right. This would be worth a hundred.

436
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,760
The P and L would be $170,000. Okay. If this were to drop now.

437
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,620
You know, it's quite, it's quite, you know,

438
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,690
the straddle is going for 830 bucks. But eventually, you know,

439
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,430
we try to buy back for, let's say about 700. That'd be the fair value.

440
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,370
I've already priced it out. $700, $710. Fair value. Okay.

441
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,980
So on a one lot of these. Right. Which is actually not very margin intensive.

442
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,880
It is $30,000. Okay. Cause the credit is being used against the collateral.

443
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,300
It's 30,000. You would make 17 grand. Per one lot. Now.

444
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,400
This might take a while to, this might take a while to play out.

445
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,310
It might take a month. It might take two months. Okay.

446
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,660
Might take them tomorrow. I take a week. But.

447
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,180
Vols are extremely, extremely pricey. And I think that, you know,

448
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,700
this will go down. And conversely though, we always need to think about, well,

449
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,390
if we're wrong. Right. We're never wrong. I'm just joking. We're always wrong.

450
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,910
But, and what would happen if we are wrong?

451
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,870
Which I don't think we're always wrong. My apologies. When we are wrong.

452
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,210
If we are wrong. What does that look like? Right.

453
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,500
If we're not thinking about the downside, we're not a trader. Okay. So what,

454
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,480
if we're wrong, what would happen? And. We look at the data.

455
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,760
That I was showing you before the max, the highest point.

456
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:44,810
The Ivy one year has ever gone to. Is 81. Okay. 81. So.

457
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,970
That'd be about eight points. We would lose here.

458
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,390
Okay. So we would lose.

459
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:06,380
And let's say we stress it to a 20% move in the underlying. Okay.

460
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,320
So per one lot. You can lose between four and $10,000. You guys were thinking,

461
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,720
how the hell does a one lot cost that? Like. Make you lose that much.

462
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,160
This is the power. Or this is what happens. When you trade. Vega. Okay.

463
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,180
And when I mean Vega, I mean a two-year option. Like this is all Vega. Right.

464
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,260
This is how much volatility can actually cost you or, or have you gain. Right.

465
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,510
It's quite a bit.

466
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,650
So that is, so that's it, Sean. What do you think? I got nothing to say.

467
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,390
I think it's awesome. Yeah. Hell yeah. So anyways, long story short,

468
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:53,240
I'm short vol. For those reasons. I think we need to name PA Vega gang.

469
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:00,560
Vega gang. Vega gang. I like it, man. What do you guys think? Vega gang.

470
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,850
New generation of traders. Vega gang. I like it. We had a couple of questions.

471
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,270
Let's scroll up a bit here.

472
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:21,340
Where is it? I saw Red had a question here. What's up, Red? How goes it, man?

473
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,870
Red, where is it? Red, I've lost your question, man. Oh, here we go. Okay.

474
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,610
So back when you were talking about the level of implied vol on Tesla right now.

475
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:36,760
You said think or swim saying the IV percentile on Tesla is only 6.42.

476
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,130
And on bar chart, it's saying the IV rank is 7.6 and IV percentile is 18%. Yes.

477
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:52,080
Yes. So keep in mind, guys, there are many different options, right?

478
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,440
So if we take a look here, we take a look here.

479
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,020
Let me pull up the share screen.

480
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:19,250
Okay. Okay. So what those IV ranks look at is this, is the IV30, right?

481
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,490
It's very low. Look how low it is.

482
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,550
Look how low it is right now relative to the last six months.

483
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,490
It's at the bottom. It's at the very bottom.

484
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,060
But what we're looking at is the one-year option. And this is at the top.

485
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,020
And to make it even so you can do, for example,

486
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,100
I was talking to my buddy at Jefferies and he was saying that every two to three

487
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,480
weeks,

488
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,680
they see a huge number of calls coming in or they call upside vol coming in,

489
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,880
right? Buying Tesla upside vol longer dated. Okay.

490
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,540
And so when I was talking to him,

491
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,280
what he's ended up doing was a reverse calendar spread, right?

492
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:10,760
Where he's buying this cheap vol, right? And selling the expensive vol.

493
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,240
And what you get by doing that is you're trading the forward vol,

494
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,600
which is this green line right here. And take a look at how expensive this is.

495
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:26,520
This is at the top, right? So the way he structured this was, okay,

496
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,480
I'm going to buy some Aprils and I'm going to sell some Jan 2023s because he's hoping

497
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,900
for that reversion in the term structure, right? Or that he realizes, right,

498
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,960
he's saying that gamma is cheap and Vega is expensive.

499
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:47,860
So he's going to sell that Vega and he's going to buy that gamma. Okay. So,

500
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:54,500
yeah, that's, so Koa asked, can I sell the two year and buy the 30 day? Oh,

501
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,760
look at that Koa. Perfect. Perfect. Right. That's the forward one year. Right.

502
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,320
I wouldn't, I wouldn't buy the 30 day.

503
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,160
I look into April because the further you go back, right.

504
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,140
And the cheaper the vol, then the higher, the forward vol. So April, the April,

505
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,940
Jan 2023 is this line right here. And it's extremely, extremely expensive.

506
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,020
So, yeah, I feel like I talked too much for that Ivy rank one.

507
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,150
Moral of the story, Ivy rank is usually looked at the 30 day options,

508
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,160
which is very low right now. But in reality,

509
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,160
the longer data stuff is extremely expensive.

510
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,900
It's being overlooked in my opinion.

511
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,890
Blessings asking what's the worst case scenario here. Yeah.

512
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,290
So the worst case scenario is vols go up eight or nine points, right?

513
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,930
Obviously, you know, freak freak environment where vols go up,

514
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:55,160
let's say 10 points. But if they were to go up 10 points,

515
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,950
the stock would have to move huge in my opinion, right?

516
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,390
Like massive to push two-year vols up 10 Vegas. It would have to be huge.

517
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,210
So that's why if you buy those, let's say April's right. Those that gamma,

518
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,890
if you do get that huge move, well, you're going to get paid for it. Right.

519
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,870
You're going to lose on the, on the, on the gens,

520
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:21,800
but you're going to make a boatload on the April's. Right. So it's a relative,

521
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,420
it's a relative value trade. I did, you know, I'm more of a cowboy as, as,

522
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:33,200
as the guy from Jeffrey's was telling me. So I'm just outright short vols,

523
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,680
but I don't, I don't work at a firm like Jeffrey, so I don't really need to.

524
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,640
So if somebody wanted to take a long vol trade,

525
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:51,440
do you think that April vol is cheap? No. No. It's cheap relative to Jan, 2023.

526
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,220
Got it. It's not cheap in absolute terms. Cool.

527
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,950
We're going to, so Marcos is commenting,

528
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,630
saying maybe the market is expecting Tesla to have a very big down move.

529
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,290
Even the markets. It could. Right. But what we're seeing, so here's the thing,

530
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,270
Marcos, which is very weird.

531
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,050
And we believe that the back is coming from structured flow. Right.

532
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,150
So I think like this one,

533
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,730
if the market thought there was going to be a big down move, well,

534
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,750
then the near gated option should be expensive as well. But they're not right.

535
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,810
The market's in contango,

536
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,490
meaning that the market thinks vol is going to be extremely low.

537
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,920
It's just that it's so steep. Right. So instead of it,

538
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,750
let's say being like this Marcos, which is fair value, it's like this.

539
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,190
So yeah. Yeah. I don't think the marketing is going to have a big down move.

540
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,800
We would see something a little bit different. We would see more call skew.

541
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,660
Okay. Or sorry. A big down. I would see more put skew.

542
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,160
And we would see more volatility.

543
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,470
But the funny you say that though, Marcos,

544
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,490
because I was talking to a couple of people and they were saying that.

545
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,860
The Martin, I think the Tesla could have a huge sell-off. So. You know,

546
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,280
maybe the market is, maybe the market is. I don't know.

547
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,360
But at least some people are. I think it's going to be a big, big down. Tico.

548
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,240
What do you think? The only opinion that matters when it comes to Tesla. Yes.

549
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,730
$2,500. Okay. Got it. 25.

550
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:43,940
So any other questions there?

551
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,120
No, it looks good. Jared. Jared, are there any questions there? I saw,

552
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,520
I saw a couple of posts. Jared. Was it a question or how you commenting a bit?

553
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,440
Yeah.

554
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,360
Of course, dude. Of course.

555
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,330
I'm going to be coming back full swing, dude.

556
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:20,150
Let's get wrapping a couple of things up. Well, definitely be back.

557
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,050
Funny enough, actually Hutch. Maybe I won't be back, dude. I got, I got the,

558
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,290
I got the new computer back. And I don't have discord anywhere.

559
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,830
Cause I took it off my phone.

560
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,320
And so I don't know my, I don't know my password.

561
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,360
So I'm going to have to reset it.

562
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,960
I might have to actually come back in under a different handle. I don't know.

563
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:46,010
So we'll see. I could tell Jordan how to reset his password, but. You know,

564
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,930
I'm liking the efficiency right now, so I might leave it for a few more weeks.

565
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,350
Exactly. Yeah. He's getting a lot of stuff done, Jared. It's, it's good.

566
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:03,370
And when I come back is a broke PRNAV 3.0. Yeah. Broke PRNAV 3.0 diamond rank.

567
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,840
Yeah, exactly. No admin status, just diamond rank.

568
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,460
But yeah, Hutch, man, I'm still,

569
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,560
I'm still telling my friends about that Disney trade.
