1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Gotta change your name on discord to the chemists the chemists love it Heisenberg

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,740
Okay, so Guys,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,280
we're gonna be going over the NKLA trade that I didn't let some of you guys did

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,060
and we're gonna actually break down A pretty in-depth thought process behind this

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,690
I want you guys to keep in mind though. I'm not always right Okay,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,070
this is how this is my thought process. This is how I want to you know,

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,470
express my view and my opinion I'm not always right So I actually encourage you

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,150
guys to you know question and also give your feedback and what you guys are thinking

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,580
Okay, but keep in mind.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,380
This is a good example of the level of research that goes into a good trade,

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,110
right? So like whether whether winner loses, I think it's a it's a good trade.

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,990
Yeah, right. Yeah,

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:54,630
let's see what you guys Let me share my screen Jordan found the trade but I hopped

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,070
in for a few lots as well Yeah,

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:02,150
I actually so it was brought to my attention It was brought to my attention by talk

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:09,200
in our group to see what you saw Tico By Tico and then I looked more into it and

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,380
then I you know,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,380
do a little more research And then I got on the phone with one of my one of my p

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,870
.m. Friends Bougie, you'll actually know him.

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,700
It's it's it's it's slay so got on the phone with him chatted with him about You

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,460
know some some some other type of trade,

22
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,500
but I brought this up and we chatted about it We did a little research and it looks

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,520
like a great trade so we're gonna explain we're gonna explain the whole reasoning

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,050
behind behind this in the thought process and How it actually went from like idea

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:46,640
generation to finally placing the trade and and getting involved Okay one second.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:02:00,780
Let me uh All right, nice, okay,

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:11,330
okay so NKLA obviously is a stock that has been has been on the move.

28
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,320
Okay, it's been on the move Moving up quite a bit. In fact,

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,170
it actually went from 10 bucks all the way up to $60 a share okay,

30
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:36,570
and What I heard was and this was the original thesis is a whole bunch of warrants

31
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,710
are gonna be exercised So we think of it like this.

32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,190
I'm gonna explain what a warrant is to start Yeah,

33
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,170
a warrant is like exactly like an option.

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,880
So and actually before even get into this guys,

35
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,800
it's Times like this where there's like a lot of attention a lot of volatility where

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,040
you can find mispricings Okay,

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,220
when there's a lot of people involved in trades like these you can find mispricings

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,520
Okay, we're trading we're talking about,

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,900
you know 40 million shares being traded on a daily basis or 30 million shares being

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,940
traded on daily basis Okay on a $60 stock.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
That's that's pretty big and the stocks only I think a few hundred million in market

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,850
cap So, you know,

43
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,390
it's during these times where we can actually see a lot of inefficiencies You're

44
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,670
gonna go in-depth and chat about it and I would love your opinion You know me because

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,290
maybe maybe I'm wrong You have to talk about our actual a true signal towards.

46
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,330
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's have a few few signals.

47
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,850
So There was in the market.

48
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,000
There was an article that was published saying These warrants are gonna be exercised

49
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,350
on July 3rd.

50
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:47,250
So what that means is During when a company starts out people a lot of times people

51
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,280
are awarded warrants Okay,

52
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,520
so let's say Sean and I Sean and I start a fund or not even a fund we start a company

53
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,240
and We hire Jim and Jim.

54
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,580
We don't have enough money to pay Jim So what we tell Jim say hey Jim, listen,

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,520
we're gonna go public with the stock soon And we're gonna give you a whole bunch

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,980
of warrants think of it. It's just like options. Okay,

57
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,460
they're long-term options And there's a few differences as well,

58
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,200
but we can think of it as a call option Jim We're gonna give you a whole bunch of

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,700
call options on our on our company If the company goes up like crazy you're gonna

60
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,740
be at a very low price Okay, so this is what happened with NKLA.

61
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,980
We got a whole bunch of warrants.

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,620
We gave it out for a $10 strike so think about like this a whole bunch of people

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,750
have the right have the call option on NKLA with a $10 strike and The stocks are

64
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,450
trading at $60 a share now what people are saying is on July 3rd You're gonna be

65
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,130
able to exercise your options Well, what does that mean? Well,

66
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:00,720
it means I can buy NKLA at $10 a share and sell it for the going price Right in

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:10,060
this case Let's say before today $65 a share and that's fantastic So you but what's

68
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,520
gonna happen is not only our shares Not only can I exchange it for the shares but

69
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,760
shares are actually gonna be created here Okay,

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,420
so a new new shares are gonna come into the market. Okay,

71
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,420
I'm not actually gonna have the right to buy I'm actually gonna be exchanging for

72
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,560
shares my warrants for shares and these shares can't come out of anywhere They can't

73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,060
just come out of the air. So the company has to create them Okay,

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,780
so that that's that is what is happening here.

75
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,200
And so people are saying well 50 million shares are gonna enter the market on July

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,510
3rd. Okay, July 3rd funny enough. It's a holiday Yeah,

77
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,270
I don't know how they came out with this but July 3rd New shares are gonna be created

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,600
and Because of that the stock is gonna plummet. Okay,

79
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,120
the stock is gonna plummet people are saying $30 a share and this is like professional

80
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,540
articles. Some people are saying $30 a share Okay.

81
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,190
Now this news Didn't just come out today. It didn't come out yesterday.

82
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:21,340
It didn't come out five days ago It actually came out a long time ago Like I think

83
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,130
it was two months ago or a month ago it was quite quite a long time ago But as we

84
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,950
got closer to the date the news started to pick up.

85
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,110
Oh my god 50 million shares are about to hit the market and so people are saying

86
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,570
this thing's gonna get diluted It's gonna get screwed and there's a lot of articles

87
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,670
that were coming out started coming out So I've been getting messages saying you

88
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,770
know what like I showed you guys one of the messages for example for my buddy Saying

89
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:47,990
hey,

90
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,490
I wouldn't touch this with a 10-foot 10-foot pole because shares are gonna drop

91
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,700
Now let's think about this for a second. Okay,

92
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,580
before we even go into the technicals of what's happening.

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's think about this. Okay? Everyone thinks shares are gonna drop.

94
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:11,890
Okay Why hasn't the shares dropped if the stock's trading at 60 and you know that

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,350
the stuff and everyone thinks the stock is gonna go to 30 Why are the why in heaven's

96
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,030
name are the shares trading at 60?

97
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,530
Right. First thing that doesn't make sense,

98
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,530
especially if it's tomorrow tomorrow,

99
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,030
July 3rd They're saying the stock is gonna reach $30 a share.

100
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,280
So why isn't everyone selling right now? Why is there more selling right now?

101
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,440
Why weren't they selling yesterday?

102
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,730
In fact The options market is implying a $40 at the money forward and we're gonna

103
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,350
go over this We're gonna break this trade down step by step But the options market

104
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:51,680
is saying the there's gonna be the stock is going 40 Why in heaven's name has the

105
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
stock been trading at 70 for the last three weeks?

106
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,030
Okay,

107
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,160
so that's the first that's the first thing that caught my attention Then what I

108
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,520
noticed was Ricky Gutierrez So I was talking to one of my one of my friends who

109
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,020
I wouldn't say one of my friends One of my mentors works at a firm pretty big firm

110
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,360
as a PM. I told him I said, hey guys Check this trade out. Okay,

111
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,000
everyone's betting on this thing going down and he's like These are these are times

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,320
where you can see huge short squeezes and we're gonna get into why this is gonna

113
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,220
be a pretty in-depth Talk here.

114
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,800
So I was like, okay, you know what? I know.

115
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,480
He's a really smart guy I'm gonna take a small bet.

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:46,140
So I took a small bet by 20 lots for a dollar 20 verticals for a dollar Next day,

117
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm down. That's okay.

118
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,560
Then I see Ricky Gutierrez make a post So let me just pop it up here and as for

119
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,720
the questions everyone will address him at the end because we'll get into the flow

120
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:25,920
of this story YouTube here

121
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,120
it is NKLA warning S1 filing 70% drop coming soon.

122
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:38,220
I watched the video and when I after I watched that video I realized Everyone is

123
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,270
on the wrong side of this trade fade Exactly. Yeah mark.

124
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,010
I think it's for I think it's 400 million shares or 450 here Let's let's do a quick

125
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,620
search, even though I'm not a big fan of Actually,

126
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,280
this is okay Let's do a quick.

127
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:05,260
Let's do a quick look here mark But the thing is we don't even know if they're gonna

128
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:18,230
exercise the warrants we're gonna we're gonna do in-depth here NKLA Yeah, okay.

129
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,130
So 300 360 million. So,

130
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:27,060
you know over over over 10% It's quite a bit that's coming into the market Chicks

131
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,150
is asking does Ricky make decent calls Well in my opinion,

132
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:40,250
absolutely not Absolutely not. So There's I've seen it.

133
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,390
I don't know if I faded any of his trades before but there was one Where I saw I

134
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,230
think it was like by USO or something right when like that you but right when I

135
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,970
was Yeah, right,

136
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,230
right when I was shorting USO But a mark is like he is not a trader.

137
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,240
Yeah anyways,

138
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,190
I saw this video and He like went into super you went to super in-depth research

139
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,570
about why this thing is going down to Why it's gonna go down to 30 bucks There's

140
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,140
a couple of really good articles about why it's going down to 30 and I realized

141
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,040
holy shit Everyone's on the wrong side of the trade here.

142
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:23,640
In fact on stock twits it went from like 90% bullish to 75% bullish in no way.

143
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,100
Yeah, and Remember, everyone's usually long right?

144
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,380
You usually have a long bias.

145
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:35,250
So Seeing something like 73% or a drop from 95 to 73. That's serious.

146
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,270
That's a signal, right?

147
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,730
That's a you know retail trade are really getting out of the market here Especially

148
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,790
with the number of watchers that NKLA has because you look at something like let's

149
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:58,420
say for example vbiv You

150
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,500
know, it's a funny one. I'm thinking of.

151
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,480
Mm-hmm So when we're talking about retail sentiment,

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,360
it goes up like an elevator down like an escalator. Yeah,

153
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,270
it's the opposite when he comes to the sentiment They get stuck holding the bag.

154
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,230
They're bullish for life So you see like vbiv for example, you know,

155
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,950
you'll have stuff like this.

156
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:22,830
It has 98% people are bullish People are usually long bias So 60% bullish makes

157
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,070
sense because most people can only buy shares.

158
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,950
They can't sell shares So they're obviously gonna be talking their book and they're

159
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:35,430
obviously gonna be in a bullish manner So we dropped like okay,

160
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:42,870
so we're at 73 now, right and just last week. We were way above 80 Right,

161
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,870
so or sorry two weeks ago.

162
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,420
We were above 80 So the sentiment is starting to come down quite a bit here and

163
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,540
and you will see if you guys read through this Shares are being diluted.

164
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,080
I posted the thing in my in my in the traders chat.

165
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,840
We're asked my buddy I said, hey, what do you think of NKLA?

166
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
He's like dude shares are getting diluted.

167
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,220
I wouldn't touch to attempt football So right away,

168
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm noticing a lot of people are bearish here.

169
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,470
Yeah now a lot of regular people are bear.

170
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,820
Yeah And a lot of people are bullish as well.

171
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,000
You guys saw right 73% But you don't have also noticing about the bullish people

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
They're all talking about like the new truck and stuff.

173
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,720
It has nothing to do with their view on what's happening, right? Right, right.

174
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,380
So the reason people are bullish is different than the reason people are bearish.

175
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,870
They're not it's not a You know like one or the other it's like the bullish people

176
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,290
are like, oh,

177
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,010
but they don't know about this new truck Everyone who thinks it's going down and

178
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,190
the guys who think it's going out like it's getting diluted Exactly,

179
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,700
so they're not even like really opposing each other now So what I noticed was the

180
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
borrow rate. Okay,

181
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,180
the cost to borrow the shares was 970 percent 970% what that means is if I let's

182
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,840
say Sean own shares. Okay,

183
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,620
and I want to sell those shares I want to short them.

184
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,020
I have to borrow it from Sean and sell them into the market and From borrowing from

185
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,300
it borrowing it from Sean is gonna cost me 970% a year Insane.

186
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,760
So what if the buy said something is wrong here?

187
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:19,880
I've seen it in a CB where it went up to like 200% But 900 900 970 and then in the

188
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,040
options market was at the time that we couldn't short any shares and if the option

189
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,430
market was implying I think a thousand and fifty percent Borrow rate. Okay,

190
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,270
so do you guys all understand what the borrow rate is?

191
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,190
It's the interest you pay on borrowing a share Yeah,

192
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,210
right so like think about like this when you want to short a share you borrow it

193
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,290
from someone and You you sell it into the market and then at a later date you buy

194
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,690
it back from the market and give it back to You borrow it from but why the hell

195
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,850
would I if I was the person you're borrowing it from why the hell would I do?

196
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,860
That for free So I chart it similar to when you take a loan what you were doing

197
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,660
is taking a loan of those shares for me So I charge you an interest rate and that

198
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,060
is the borrow rate And just to put in perspective to borrow Apple costs less than

199
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:07,040
the percent. Okay, and that's annualized annualized. Yeah, so Right away.

200
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,440
Something's wrong. I think your phone's going on inside.

201
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:18,860
Yeah Yeah That's turned off So what's happening here is the shorts are saying we

202
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,680
are so confident We are like think about it who in their right mind would be shorting

203
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,410
shares at a thousand percent a year Who would be doing that?

204
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
No one no one in their right mind.

205
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,520
No one sophisticated would be shorting shares a thousand a thousand percent a year

206
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,140
Because it gives you no room for error No room for error Okay,

207
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,040
and when we look at this stock when we actually see what's going on with this stock

208
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,320
There's nothing really like there's nothing bad about the company sure they're not

209
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
making money sure they had a crazy run You know,

210
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,050
the idea is great There's nothing really bad about it to be paying a thousand dollars

211
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,700
a share like even for Herbalife when Ackman was short It didn't go the bull right

212
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:12,090
didn't go past 15% a year Right and Bill Ackman was saying this is a fraud Yet people

213
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,830
are paying a thousand percent.

214
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,960
Just like let that sink in for a second to short this thing So what they're telling

215
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,670
you is I'm 100% sure this thing is going down and it's going down fast Okay.

216
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,830
Now they've been wrong for quite a long time. They look at the stock.

217
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,280
Okay, look at the stock here.

218
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,540
Oh Yeah,

219
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:45,380
I guess we're right here right the stock has been flat This whole time they've been

220
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:53,170
paying money out to the long holders and they're down quite a bit Who do you guys

221
00:16:53,170 --> 00:17:00,660
think I want to get you guys your opinion here Who do you guys think is a hundred

222
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,010
percent confident on this trade who's 100% confident about this trade that's going

223
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:15,440
down Can someone get someone give me a Oh Mark that was in my interactive brokers.

224
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,710
We'll show you guys where it is at the end Just remind us because I chigs was asking

225
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,830
as well. Yeah, um Well,

226
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,950
the thing is I don't think anyone has interactive brokers here.

227
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,110
You have fingers I don't think you can see you don't think personally. Oh, no,

228
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,070
you have to call them.

229
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,690
You have to call them Unfortunately give thinker keep thinker summer call see where

230
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,220
it is So bougie brought up a good point. He said insiders. Yeah, okay.

231
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,700
Okay now we have an issue there though,

232
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:48,470
right an insider an insider is Probably not gonna be selling shares because or shorting

233
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,340
shares because that's gonna bring a lot of attention She made a lot of attention.

234
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,520
Hmm. So who do you think is gonna be shorting shares legally here, right?

235
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Because if you're short these shares like and stock drops like you are good.

236
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,820
Like everyone's looking at this thing This is not like,

237
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,980
you know Some name that no one's looking at that if it goes down you you get to

238
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,090
profit and that's it But you walk away you are gonna be looked at Like why are the

239
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,770
hell is this guy paying a thousand percent a share?

240
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,330
Like that's pretty that's pretty blatant that you know something that no one else

241
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,960
knows So does anyone know or want to guess who is gonna be paying a thousand percent

242
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
to short shares?

243
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,120
Because I know no one in this group would I know for a fact no one in this group

244
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,380
would Robin Hood traders Okay.

245
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,320
Yeah, so so Danny to borrow the share so on interactive brokers,

246
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,160
for example You can write on the where the stock symbol is It'll say short of all

247
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,720
or not short of all and I'll tell you what the borrow rate is I don't I don't know

248
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,980
if it's on thinkorswim. You might have to call them,

249
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,170
but it's a thousand percent Oh when I looked at it last the options were implying

250
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,800
a thousand percent and I'll show you guys on thinkorswim How you can price it as

251
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:04,980
well.

252
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,900
So I'll show you guys But it's gonna be through a synthetic so keep in mind this

253
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,600
is a silver lecture Okay It's gonna be a little bit tricky to me a little bit challenging

254
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,660
You guys are gonna be better people on the other side of this better traders.

255
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,980
You guys are always already great people Cody saying mm's. Okay, so Okay,

256
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,520
the people who would be shorting these shares are the people who hold the warrants

257
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,980
at $10 a share It's the only people why because they're locking in their profit

258
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:43,250
No one in no one else in this world is gonna short these things at $1,000 a share

259
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,790
except for the people Who own the warrants?

260
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,160
Okay, do you guys understand that do you guys understand break it down? Yeah,

261
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,460
I have the right to buy Apple I have the right to buy this stock at $10 a share.

262
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:04,080
It's trading at 65 I can go and short the shares right now and Lock in my profit.

263
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm locking it in I can have the right to buy them at 10 and I'm selling them right

264
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,030
now at 65 Yeah, exactly,

265
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:21,150
right because no I receiving that huge percentage because everyone's talking about.

266
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,430
Oh my god These shares are going down.

267
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,130
These shares are going down and think about it you think about you as an investor

268
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,510
holding these warrants and All you're hearing is these shares are going down once

269
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,980
I come and exercise my warrants Well,

270
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,800
hell I'm gonna go short it before before the warrants get exercised Right.

271
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,400
We're starting to get into the efficient market here, right?

272
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,960
People are not stupid I'm gonna go short this thing before it happens There's the

273
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,540
only people on this planet who are shorting at a thousand percent a year annualized

274
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,310
There is no room for error if it takes one month for the stock to go down 30% Guess

275
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,120
what? You've lost money, right?

276
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,800
There's no room for error and they're not getting squeezed out You guys you guys

277
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,860
notice that right?

278
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:16,780
We got the rally on Bullish sentiment and no one is getting squeezed out here because

279
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,520
they already own the shares They don't care if the stock goes up another million

280
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,580
points They own it at 10 and they're locking in their profit at 65 70 dollars a

281
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:32,900
share Exactly, right. So who's you saying? It's it's you know,

282
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,700
it's basically 3% annualized a day.

283
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:42,140
You're spending 3% a day Can you believe that there's no one on this planet who's

284
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:48,120
going to do that except for the people who are Guaranteeing who can guarantee a

285
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,540
profit.

286
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:57,720
That's the it that's it So coasting the company can can force repurchase of the

287
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,390
warrants sure,

288
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,630
but at the same time though They they still have that right to buy it at $10 a share

289
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,680
or whatever is $11 a share They still have that right even if they have to buy more

290
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,000
warrants,

291
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,590
they still have that right and they're locking in their profits right now So what's

292
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,350
gonna happen once all this gets exercised? Right.

293
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,290
Well all of a sudden I exchange for my shares.

294
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:30,590
I buy back my shorts and what happens we get a squeeze Is that does that make sense

295
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,090
you break that down a little bit? Yeah,

296
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,000
so I own a warrant So I own a call option to buy these shares at at $10.

297
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,800
They're trading at 65 So I said, you know what? Let me go.

298
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,780
I'm happy with with those profits. I'm gonna sell the shares at $65 Okay,

299
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,550
all of a sudden Shares come into the market.

300
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:57,270
I close out my my short position Everyone else closes out their short position Stocks

301
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,280
rally Because now there's no more news like you you guys are noticing here.

302
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,120
It's stocks trading at 57 bucks If this thing was really going to 30 it wouldn't

303
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,330
be trading at $57 today The reason why we had that down move Right is because people

304
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,770
are saying all this could happen.

305
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,430
This could happen and they're selling their shares So they're getting rid of their

306
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,450
shares, but also remember guys if I own shares Okay,

307
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:28,230
and Sean's borrowing them and I decide to sell them Guess what?

308
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,420
Sean's got to cover Sean has to cover his shares Right.

309
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,940
There's not there's not an infinite supply in the market here Okay,

310
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,730
so there's a reason why the stock is not trading at 30 and it's partly because of

311
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,370
the borrow rate, right?

312
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,310
People don't want to sell they're making a thousand percent a year.

313
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,950
That's partly because of it,

314
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:56,310
but a lot of it is because Everyone's already short. There's no more.

315
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,830
You can't you can't short shares anymore.

316
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,300
They're not available Everyone is already short.

317
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,080
So there's only one way up Is that making sense?

318
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,090
That's our view Danny. Yeah,

319
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:25,060
so our view is so the view that I'm taking is Once once this doomsday event comes

320
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,640
out So this has been going on for a long time guys And just like you know,

321
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,400
we always have to ask ourselves like if if everyone thinks this stock is going down

322
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,280
Why is it not down right? Why is it up?

323
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,640
And then once the news is over, right?

324
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,300
It's like we have to think about one step ahead What happens once this news is over

325
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,100
what happens everyone knows it's coming out.

326
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,820
Everybody knows it's coming out It's not like it's a surprise.

327
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,080
It's not like there's a there's a there's a ER call and they say hey,

328
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,720
we're dropping We're loading 50 million shares into the market. Now.

329
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,520
The market has to reprice This is a known event,

330
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,140
right and it's still still bit up here.

331
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:11,000
So what happens after the event is gone There's only one way up.

332
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,800
There's only one way to go and that's that's and that's to the moon So if I can

333
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,760
got our space suit on And we're hoping for a rally,

334
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,560
okay,

335
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:29,190
and then so I talked to one of my PM's and Not one of my PM's well One of my friends

336
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,270
who's a PM and he he looked at who owns the shares who owns the warrants He was

337
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,230
on the terminal last night.

338
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,350
He has access to Bloomberg even if he's not in the office so he was looking at like

339
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,910
who owns these things and a Lot of the board members own it, right?

340
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,800
We actually we actually might see a scenario where they don't even exercise it Where

341
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,440
they just continue to hold these these long-dated call options because it doesn't

342
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,760
look good on the company Imagine imagine I'm a CEO and I say I'm selling all my

343
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,740
shares. Yeah,

344
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,560
right and then not only that though Then there's then there's technical issues where

345
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,800
if I sell all my shares all of a sudden.

346
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,660
I don't need power anymore I don't as a board seat member.

347
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,400
I don't need more power Right.

348
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,820
So there there are going to be there's are some structural reasons for this Our

349
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,780
view is and my view is not right I'm just trying to explain it to you guys how my

350
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:26,650
thought process is how I'm thinking about it Is that this this moved down today

351
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:33,590
13% on a doomsday scenario? Are you guys still able to hear us dancing?

352
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:40,440
He's having some trouble with sound you can't hear. Yeah. Okay.

353
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,640
Nice It's so funny. Okay. Yeah,

354
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,420
I'm like so funny Dan's just like did anyone else lose sound and then I asked,

355
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,620
you know, did anyone lose sound and Or does it sound good? They all said yes,

356
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,090
so I don't know if sounds bad or what? Yes, but it's broken up a bit. Okay.

357
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,590
Yeah,

358
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:05,950
so That's my thought process guys in terms of Why we're taking this trade because

359
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,850
not one person I've talked to not one thing is going up thinks it's a squeeze Everyone

360
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,510
is short and everyone short in the markets not going up and there's not going down

361
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,160
What's going on? Fuck is buying this shit? Who's buying it?

362
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,800
Retail no way It's not enough.

363
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,850
There's no way Retail is saying that this thing's going down who is holding this

364
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,630
and then JPM's of you. J. J.

365
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:39,560
JP Morgan's neutral JP Morgan has a neutral price target on this thing But retail

366
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,960
are super bearish and to see Ricky like once I saw Ricky Gutierrez put that thing

367
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,380
up. I said, this is it You know,

368
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,780
this is in like putting in all that work all that in front like all that research

369
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,630
To come up with a conclusion.

370
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,040
I think It doesn't make sense it's all this this is already known like I'm trying

371
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,400
to I want you guys understand this,

372
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,600
okay I'm trying to get my point across here.

373
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:10,000
If the market knows it's going to $30 tomorrow Why in heaven's name is it trading

374
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,260
at 60 who's still there who is still there,

375
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,060
right? We really need to think critical about this.

376
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,460
The market's going to 30 tomorrow and this is my own information Would you would

377
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,160
you okay. It's like markets going to 30 tomorrow.

378
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,220
Would you hold shares at 60 today? And like this is known information.

379
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,100
Would you hold shares at 60 yesterday or the day before would you be holding shares

380
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,560
right now?

381
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,360
if if it was if it was a if it was guaranteed if it was guaranteed no one in their

382
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,240
right mind would and Especially because someone would start early on selling you'd

383
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,690
see the price starting to drop What when you like you're not gonna wait until the

384
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,850
day before right like um,

385
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,790
like well What's an example we can tie this back to in the stock market because

386
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,830
we talk about this all the time It's not tradable information. Yeah. No. Yeah,

387
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,490
it's not tradable information. This is not tradable information, right?

388
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,510
This is the game theory thing. Yeah, right,

389
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,030
right If you know that it's gonna be there I'm gonna start selling you're gonna

390
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,730
start selling because you want to guarantee your fill because you might not get

391
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,670
it if you wait Till the last day, right and then so the flip side is, you know,

392
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,710
as a trader, we always have thing about the flip side Well,

393
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,290
there are people still holding this because they're getting paid $1,000 a share

394
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,330
and then we gotta think well who's shorting this It's definitely no one sophisticated.

395
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:30,640
No one can be holding this thing at a thousand percent a year No one no one sophisticated

396
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,500
so people are short.

397
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,460
This is only the whore the warrant holders It's only people left.

398
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,040
So even if the 50 million shares come to market Okay,

399
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,580
it's not it's not gonna change.

400
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,990
It's not gonna change the It's not gonna change the stock price the stock trades

401
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:04,050
50 million shares a day for 30 million shares a day So I'm really thinking this

402
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:10,190
is gonna be a blow off the top squeeze and here's the other thing Because of this

403
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,270
view in the market right now We're not risking that much for potentially huge rewards

404
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,020
if we're right. Yeah, we're able to get on a great trade Yeah,

405
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,080
okay So Cole's asking how high will it go?

406
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,360
I'm not too sure but I really think it's gonna be below off the top like Maybe near

407
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,940
to new time highs. I know it's a crazy statement,

408
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,060
but this thing is a thousand percent a year There's gonna be a quick recovery a

409
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,960
very very quick recovery once they start filling those shares And we remember those

410
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,500
shares have to get filled Those shares have to be bought back They're not just gonna

411
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,360
stay short forever. Right there.

412
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,160
Those shares have to be bought back at some point at some point It's too expensive

413
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,580
to hold short shares So anyways, he's got a good thing.

414
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,280
He's asked that quite twice now. So it's oh, sorry. Yeah Yeah,

415
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,180
so if you add so let's take a look at this question first.

416
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,620
Yes for this video Okay, he's asking. Well,

417
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,660
how do short shares affect the price of the stock? Well,

418
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,900
Danny what they're basically doing is they're increasing.

419
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,210
So let's say you have a Million shares out. Okay,

420
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,030
and then all of a sudden I come in and put 50 million into the market Well,

421
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,810
all of a sudden everyone who owns those shares on a little bit less of the pie So

422
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,870
the stock is should should drop right because now it's not worth as much anymore

423
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,780
but in this case Right.

424
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,290
What we're seeing is People are holding the warrants and then shorting their shares

425
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,390
So this should already be reflected in the price because it's basically gonna be

426
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,670
a exchange Right,

427
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,950
they're shorting shares more and more things are coming into the market, right?

428
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:53,170
So we shouldn't see the stock coming down and once that news is out Everyone else

429
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,130
who is not part of the work the warrant holders and who are short these stocks Honestly,

430
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,410
I don't know who is skip mind boggles me a thousand percent.

431
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,610
They're gonna be buying back these shares So we're gonna get a huge move.

432
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,600
So we're gonna huge move We should we should at least see that and that's that's

433
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,000
my view.

434
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,410
So let's let's open up in the top Let's open up thinkorswim now,

435
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,660
that's only half of the pie That's only half that's only half the puzzle The next

436
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,000
half of the puzzle is let's let's set up a trade because if what do we do about

437
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,420
it? Yeah, because in my opinion if I'm only getting one-to-one here,

438
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,290
I'm not happy if I'm getting point five to one here I'm not happy.

439
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,850
I want one to ten.

440
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,270
I want one to five I don't want to have to be right with super conviction to make

441
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,890
money I just want to be right some of the time and if I'm right hell,

442
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,940
yeah Right, so that's how we got to think about this.

443
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,100
We have our hypothesis we go in-depth We try to think about why this should happen

444
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:55,940
Right.

445
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,910
Why are people wrong and then can we set up a trade where we have a good bet?

446
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,460
So let's first do well, we're looking at it.

447
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,460
Jake's is asking Have you ever seen a borrow rate this high before never never never

448
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,100
in my life?

449
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,410
I don't we're near not even close not even close But it only makes sense now Because

450
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,630
the people who are shorting this thing are 100% confident,

451
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:32,240
right they only got 10 bucks a share Okay, so if we look at NKLA here,

452
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:40,800
let's go to So let's say we want to bet on this thing going down. Okay,

453
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:48,320
so let's say we buy the the 59 and we sell so we're gonna buy a put spread so we

454
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,980
buy the 59 and we sell the Let's say 45.

455
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,190
Let's take a look at this trade.

456
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,530
Look at this.

457
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,960
Look at this risk reward to bet on this thing going down Does this make does this

458
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,390
make sense to anyone? Brutal, would you be betting on this thing going down?

459
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:20,030
Kyle Wow puts are so cheap Right, so I hope it was a joke You know,

460
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:25,230
so you wouldn't want to be betting on this thing going down at all because you have

461
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,820
to be super confident That this thing is going down.

462
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,790
So instead we have our thesis. We have our hypothesis.

463
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:38,930
Can we set up a good trade? Well, I think it's a blow off the top, right?

464
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:44,410
So what I did was I structured the 65 72s. So I did a call spread.

465
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:57,220
How do you guys like this? Right. Oh, baby.

466
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,760
We don't have to be we don't have to be right that often We were getting we're getting

467
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,950
seven to one here. We don't need to be right that often Right,

468
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,530
and I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm right 55 50 to 55 out of 45 here.

469
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:15,800
That's what I'm thinking This option is telling me I only need to be right 10% of

470
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,530
the time or sorry 15% of the time.

471
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,940
That's it So I think I have 55% chance of going up market's telling me a Jordan

472
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:31,620
you only need a 50 15% That's a huge edge. That's a huge edge for me, right?

473
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,340
So this is this why we decided to place his trade. We did it.

474
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,100
We did a few others, right?

475
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,540
We did the 65 70 for 60 cents Danny saying can this trade still be taken? Yeah.

476
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,560
Well, no, no,

477
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,580
it can't be anymore Danny because It should it should blow off the top for Monday

478
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:56,120
because it's coming into the market tomorrow Oddly enough But you should see you

479
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,570
should see the squeeze on Monday, so it's it's gone.

480
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:10,690
It's it's a it's a it's a make or break So so this is this is a huge position I

481
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:16,970
have on which is this 60 cents to win five Right.

482
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,180
I don't I only need to be right 10% of the time to make money Current stock price

483
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,140
is like 57 bucks or something. Yeah,

484
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:37,320
58 58 58 50 after hours 58 20 Right,

485
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,660
and it's strange because you you would think this thing's going to 30 bucks But

486
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,820
it's gonna hold and then all of a sudden you have all these people so we're gonna

487
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,580
have a shift now, right?

488
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,260
You have all these people who are short or who are think this thing is coming down

489
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:58,280
all of a sudden kill a black fly All of a sudden the shift changes you have to cover

490
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:05,520
boom Stocks gonna push so that's that's a that's the theory here So and the reason

491
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,200
why we can get this for so cheap. Can someone explain to me again?

492
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,940
Why we can get this for so cheap? Good question. Yeah, why can I get this?

493
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,840
For very very cheap.

494
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,570
No time to expiry. No, that's not quite Danny.

495
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:31,890
This is actually the 17 No one's buying calls 100% okay Skew not quite not quite.

496
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,320
I'm gonna be very impressed. Someone gets this one here Booze I booze. Yeah,

497
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
I know you know this man.

498
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,860
Oh, it says because everyone is buying puts Did he yeah, we're yep.

499
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,810
So everyone's buying coach puts but that doesn't make that doesn't make the That

500
00:37:53,810 --> 00:38:01,490
doesn't make the calls cheap Everyone thinks it's going down Yeah,

501
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,730
everyone thinks it's going down. Right? Okay.

502
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:10,450
So the reason is because the borrow rate is priced into the options So remember

503
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,670
holding those shares you get a thousand percent a year to Cody. Just get it.

504
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,920
Yeah, okay Because of the interest rate to cover the borrow rate Cody.

505
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,600
You're a legend man.

506
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,180
So holding those shares Buying the shares you get a thousand percent a year.

507
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,910
It's the option, right?

508
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,380
So the options are gonna imply that as well and the puts are gonna imply that So

509
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,440
what what is that?

510
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,450
So we're gonna go into something called the implied forward and guys Sorry about

511
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,530
like this is a silver line.

512
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,690
Just want to make sure this gets a little too complicated.

513
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,880
This is a silver life Okay Okay,

514
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,450
it needs to be it needs to be talked about okay,

515
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:59,600
so the implied forward is where the where the Where the the premiums line up?

516
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,780
Okay. So for example on SP why?

517
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,390
Let's give it a second guys okay,

518
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:23,380
so SP why for example the implied forward is $313 you see how the premiums line

519
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,410
up here 525 20 Right.

520
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,710
So this is where the market in 15 days think that the average stock price is gonna

521
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,170
be at three hundred thirteen dollars Let's go take a look at NK LA.

522
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,270
It's actually dropping off.

523
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:43,210
I'm notice it dropped off a bit So the market is expecting it to be so you can see

524
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,540
here four dollars and sixty cents fourteen dollars and twenty cents That's that's

525
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,800
not right ten dollars eight dollars.

526
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:57,620
That's still not right 45 we're getting 13 and 7 so it's gonna be in between 45

527
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,660
and 50 so about 47 and this actually started coming off towards end of the day So

528
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,840
earlier in the day was like 45 44 So what the what the options market is saying

529
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,800
is the average price in the future in the next 15 days is gonna be 45 bucks Did

530
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,640
you guys see that Kyle saying is that row?

531
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,280
No row is the sensitivity to the interest rate?

532
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,590
Not not the borrow rate too fast, man. Okay, Danny.

533
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,310
We'll go over it again The options market, okay,

534
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,370
the option market implies a future price on average price, so let's say,

535
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,120
you know Okay,

536
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,180
so here's the stock right stocks right here the option mark is future looking it's

537
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,800
looking into the it's looking into the future It's an expiration is in 15 days.

538
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,680
Not tomorrow of 15 days.

539
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:57,120
And so usually you'll see a stock where The implied forward meaning what the options

540
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,560
market thinks it's gonna be in the future is gonna be in line To where it is right

541
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:08,390
now, right because the best price of the future is the current price Right.

542
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,990
Remember what we said guys if you think the stock is going up You would buy the

543
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:19,290
stock and you would do that until the stock is at your future value so the stock

544
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:24,480
price today is The stock price very close to the future.

545
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,160
Okay, is that making sense everyone? Let's actually take a two-second breather.

546
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Yeah,

547
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,040
let's take it to say because this is gonna get doesn't get heavy We'll take it.

548
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,820
We'll take a two-second breather. Are you doing good? It's too much.

549
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:51,790
I think Maybe but it's okay. It's okay. Okay. It's just it's a trade breakdown.

550
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,830
Yeah, exactly Well, hope you guys are seeing like this is uh,

551
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,300
it's pretty interesting Yeah, it's good trade. Yeah,

552
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,600
let's give let's give it a second here guys everyone like, you know,

553
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,440

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,240
Yeah Feel the energy in the room.

555
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:23,210
Come on I need my boomsticks Everybody out of your seats Okay,

556
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,350
the options remember how so we're just talking here we said,

557
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,690
you know The current stock price today is very similar to the stock price in the

558
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:39,870
future Now what about for let's say 365 days into the future or let's say five years

559
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,090
into the future for the S&P 500 What do you guys what do you guys think is a fair

560
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:50,520
value? Okay for S&P 500 500 days into the future. Sorry about these lines.

561
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,640
I swear to God. I don't use them Every time you come to this page,

562
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,920
they're there guys So,

563
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:03,660
what do you think a good price for S&P 500 is 500 500 days into the future if it's

564
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,840
at 312 right now What do you guys think just like some brainstorm ideas?

565
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,700
What are you guys thinking?

566
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,950
350 Danny love that answer man,

567
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,300
or okay 400 might be a little bit too high But it's gonna be above 312 right because

568
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,320
equities on average go up into the future So you'll see here we go to SPY.

569
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,470
Okay, and we go to the leaps Okay,

570
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:47,820
three years into the future You'll see Actually,

571
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:57,890
you know what because of the dividends embedded in here Okay,

572
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:04,690
so something like QQQ Where there's no dividends Because dividends are also implied

573
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:14,760
in options, okay okay,

574
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,720
so I guess because a lot of people are still betting that the markets going down

575
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,710
the You can see that the implied forward is about two for not for Nasdaq.

576
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,630
It's about two 254 it's only two bucks. But if we look at something,

577
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:58,810
let's say let's go back in time here before this whole kovat situation Okay,

578
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:07,160
so you guys can see here that the implied forward is around 193 for two years out

579
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,300
right 193 192 in the stock trading at 189.

580
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,560
So four dollars up from from where it is And that's because on average stocks should

581
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,630
make money Okay,

582
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,570
so there's kind of like people already pricing in the long run this stock is gonna

583
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:31,300
go up and we take where Where the strikes line up where that were the the the option

584
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,870
prices line up, okay So you can see here at the money This is you know,

585
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:44,280
18 or let's say $19 and here it's only 14 of 16 or $17, right?

586
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,480
So these are cheaper than the calls and that's because the markets implying the

587
00:45:48,480 --> 00:46:00,690
stock to go up in the future So let's go back to to NKLA when 15 days you can see

588
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:05,540
here at the Price of these options. Okay,

589
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,520
where they're equal is between 50 and 45 Okay,

590
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,840
that's where the extrinsic value or the the The option values are gonna be the same

591
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,660
both the call and the put it's the at the money forward Okay,

592
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,650
it's the forward price of the at the money. Does that make sense?

593
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,590
So in 15 days,

594
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:33,900
what's gonna be the at the money strike and so the market saying between 45 and

595
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:43,310
50 aka a 30% We're just over 25% drop in the market in the next 15 days,

596
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,050
that's the at the money forward That's where the market saying the future value

597
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:53,110
is gonna be Yeah,

598
00:46:53,250 --> 00:47:03,220
so it definitely would be it definitely would be chicks so Can't remember was why

599
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,490
I got so off track now Okay. Anyways,

600
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:13,900
so what we can do is okay if we basically So this might get a little a little tricky

601
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,460
guys, but just bear with me here Okay,

602
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,620
we're gonna try to extract out the borrow rate from the options because the options

603
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:35,310
market is implying the borrow rate so bear with me we are going to buy the 59 and

604
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:46,860
Sell the 59 we're gonna sell the put by the call. Okay Now,

605
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,730
what do we have here? What is this? Get rid of this.

606
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:59,910
It looks like stonk to me Shh don't say the answer Guys, what is this?

607
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,840
It's one stock.

608
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,860
It's one stonk exactly But guess what guess what's happening here?

609
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,520
Can someone tell me what's happening here?

610
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:22,980
What's what's the difference between this and one stonk price? Yeah,

611
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,810
what else do you guys notice? What's the difference?

612
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:38,120
There's there's one difference between this and one stonk You guys got this here.

613
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,980
You know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna show one stonk. Okay,

614
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,760
it's not data Okay,

615
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:49,530
I'm gonna buy one stonk here that's a great word say stonks yeah here it is so here's

616
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:54,480
the here's the one stonk Okay, I'm gonna switch over to the synthetic.

617
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,730
This is called a synthetic. Okay,

618
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:04,960
I'm gonna do one more time synthetic stock stonk stonk Okay,

619
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,740
can someone tell me what the difference is the time? Nope. It's not the time.

620
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,710
It's not the time The leverage. Nope. Okay,

621
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:19,830
I'm gonna do one more time Spot price Okay, Mark's Mark's getting it.

622
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,540
Actually mark did get it.

623
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:34,000
Okay, mark mark got it. Okay guys Where's our break even on this trade?

624
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:44,010
It's 4482 4482 is our break-even here. What about for the stock?

625
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:51,160
It's at the money. It's the current spot price Right. So what's happening here?

626
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:59,640
We're getting paid To put on this trade we are collecting $1,420 to buy this stock.

627
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,440
Are you guys seeing this? Look the stocks trading right here.

628
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:12,220
The stocks trading at 58 and we when we put on this trade we buy it for 44 How awesome

629
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:18,990
is that? Right, and why is that the case? Co is saying so buy it. Okay,

630
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,410
so if that's the case,

631
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:27,450
right and the stock goes down we can still lose money here So why why is this at

632
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:33,360
$44 if you guys can figure out if you guys can tell me why this at $44 I'm gonna

633
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,760
be mind-blown. I'm gonna blow.

634
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,460
I'm probably gonna catch I'm gonna stop this life.

635
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,270
Yeah But now you've incentivized them to get it wrong.

636
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:48,330
Yeah So Bourgeois saying can you compare a naked long call with the vertical?

637
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:54,320
Yes. I'll do that. I'll do that after bourgeois do that after 58 14. Okay.

638
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,440
Yeah, 58 minus 14, right? But why are we getting paid?

639
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,340
Why are we getting paid to put on this trade?

640
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,400
No, come on guys.

641
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,400
Let's think that's really that's really thinking about this here.

642
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,740
Why are we getting paid to put on this trade?

643
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:16,520
Why are we getting paid to buy this stock? Okay, Dan 99.

644
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,660
He's getting that he's getting it. No, it's not. Okay.

645
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,720
It's because of the borrow rate Right,

646
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:31,840
if I buy the stock I get a thousand percent because I can lend it out to Sean so

647
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:39,740
if I have this trade then right I can create an arbitrage by buying this and Selling

648
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,000
the shares against it. Check this out. Okay,

649
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:56,900
so we have a stock and I'm gonna sell these shares So here's our here's our here's

650
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,930
our synthetic I'm gonna sell the shares boom all of a sudden you guys can see I

651
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,310
locked in my 13,040 but wait a minute. Wait a minute.

652
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,050
There's no free money here. Why is there no free money?

653
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:17,530
Why why can I not lock this in I hold the option? Yeah,

654
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:21,160
but why why so I can buy it.

655
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,660
So basically I can buy the stock at $44 You guys can see that right I can buy the

656
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:30,880
stock at 44 But I can go into the market right now and sell it for 58 aka locking

657
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,400
in an arm. Why is it not an arbitrage? Why is it not an arm?

658
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,680
This would be interesting to see if anyone gets chicks got it Yes,

659
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:44,000
because you're gonna pay the short interest on the short shares So even though you're

660
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,840
getting paid right now you're locking you by shorting those shares I have to pay

661
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,790
back that $1,400 in the shares okay,

662
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:58,020
so You know that was just I wanted you guys see how this synthetic works How the

663
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,760
at the money forward works and what the options market is implying It's implying

664
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:11,620
the stock going to $44 in the next 15 days That's pretty damn big That's a pretty

665
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,900
damn big drop. Kyle's got a good question, but isn't that 1,400 over a year?

666
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,770
But you're on a July expiry Right. So this is actually 15 days.

667
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:25,510
We're gonna collect this 1,500 We're gonna cut the 1,400 right now and in 15 days

668
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:30,990
We're gonna keep it if the stock didn't move we would keep that 1,500 bucks But

669
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,730
you got a thousand percent a year.

670
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:39,810
That's seven hundred dollars That's that's a ton of money the shares trading at

671
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:45,150
six seventy bucks or sixty bucks a thousand is six hundred So you're paying out?

672
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:51,790
600 times 100 that's 60 grand in a whole year But what that equals in 15 days,

673
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:58,320
which is our option expiration 14 is 1,400, right? So no ARB no ARB here,

674
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,920
right?

675
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,400
So what's happening is what what what we're seeing basically is that stock market

676
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:14,490
is saying? 60 bucks option market is saying $44 Someone's wrong.

677
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,250
Someone's wrong.

678
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:21,480
Someone's right either stocks are gonna go down or Stock market stocks only go up

679
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,720
stocks only go up, right?

680
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:30,280
So what we did was we said because the the call options are so cheap because why

681
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,920
we are Inherently getting the implied forward price we're buying this vertical spread

682
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:44,280
and we're getting this implied forward and that's why the stone the The vertical

683
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,600
spread is so cheap because think about it like this The options market is saying

684
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:58,030
at the money is $44 and we are buying a $65 call spread okay,

685
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:04,960
the options market is saying is $44 at the month and we are buying a 65 call spread

686
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:12,280
even though the stocks trading at 60 and that's why we can get seven to one on this

687
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:21,860
trade right if so code master saying Right.

688
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:28,720
So so Danny what we're saying is The options market is wrong because and even this

689
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,460
is okay Yeah,

690
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,640
I should have said the options market is different than stock market.

691
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,450
I should I shouldn't have said that my apologies The reason why the options market

692
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:43,410
is pricing this in is because of the borrow rate Right because people are shorting

693
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:48,630
the stock like crazy if no one was shorting the stock this wouldn't be we wouldn't

694
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,120
get a credit of $14 it'd be zero.

695
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:58,030
So because people are shorting shares so much it's pushing back The at the money

696
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:04,400
implied forward so that there's no arbitrage Okay,

697
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,340
think about like this if this was zero,

698
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,780
okay I wonder what you guys would do here you guys can tell me this Sean and I are

699
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,400
what do you want to do if they can tell me the answer here?

700
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:26,100
Okay If this was zero dollars, what is the trade if this was zero dollars?

701
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:32,790
What is the trade if we could buy this synthetic for zero dollars?

702
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,180
What's the trade?

703
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:41,540
I'm gonna freak out. I know someone's gonna get it here. Yeah,

704
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,580
then we got to wrap it up shit There's no way over but mm-hmm. It was good.

705
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,960
There's good talk. It's a good chat.

706
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,720
Come on guys I know you got this. I had polls for you guys, too,

707
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,750
but I had pull for you guys But I don't think we're gonna get to it.

708
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,060
So what do you guys think if this was zero dollars? What could we do?

709
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,270
What can we do?

710
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:08,950
Okay Okay,

711
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:20,910
who's that who said that code master code master super close what you would do is

712
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:31,830
you would sell this Super close you would sell this right buy shares and Collect

713
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,430
the 1,400 on the shares, right?

714
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:40,370
I'd lend I'd do that I'd lend I'd let my shares to Sean and collect the 1,400.

715
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,070
So because of that by people shorting the shares It's driving down the price of

716
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:53,600
the options market Getting mocked a because the people in the warrants are selling

717
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,960
and selling and selling that there's no more shares left and that's driving up The

718
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,950
cost to borrow and so what's happening is the options markets can Push down push

719
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:06,330
down at the money implied forwards game push down And so we can come in here and

720
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:10,000
be like, well, let's buy some call spreads For one to seven.

721
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,500
I've never seen that in my life. By the way,

722
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,540
I've never seen it that close to at the money I've never seen it.

723
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,420
So that is what's happening here Okay,

724
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,080
the markets are saying basically this thing's going to $44 in the next 15 days and

725
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:31,010
we're saying Probably not Probably not and not just that that that's only the first

726
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,790
step The probably not is only the first step.

727
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,850
The second step is what are the odds?

728
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,770
What are the odds you're giving me to be right? Oh,

729
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,340
you're giving me seven to one to be right here That's a rock and roll.

730
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,570
Let's do it. Let's let's play this game Okay,

731
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:53,420
so I hope you guys are seeing like so I hope you guys are like starting to see you

732
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,700
know Okay, so you guys won't do the polls real quick.

733
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,960
I think I had two questions. So let's do it. Let's just do it Okay,

734
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,240
let's just do it. All right,

735
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,320
and then we're gonna we're gonna finish it up there But I hope I hope you guys really

736
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,720
like this because this was like, you know,

737
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:11,310
I look at trades Sometimes not all the time sometimes when they come up.

738
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:13,910
Yeah when they come up these don't happen that often, right?

739
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,870
Remember I said guys play tight to the vest most of the time have your own systematic

740
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:21,100
strategy and then sometimes when these come up Take a bet man.

741
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:30,570
Take a bet and bet bet decent bet a good size Launch pull and so just yeah launch

742
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,010
pull and then actually I want to quickly go over.

743
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,910
I see lavelle's here So I really want to quickly go over a trade that she did that

744
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,680
was very similar Okay,

745
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,380
and that had huge risk reward because she was betting on the stock going up So betting

746
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,060
on this stock going up pays out big if you're right in this kind of a situation,

747
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,100
right? And if you're not blind, right and if you're wrong,

748
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:59,120
you're gonna you're gonna lose very very minimal Cody. You make me laugh,

749
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,950
man Co a send me a message if you found another art, but this is not an ARB.

750
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:08,170
There's no ARB here Just a good bet it's just a good bet Well,

751
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,450
yeah lay it on me dude,

752
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:15,610
or as Codemaster said lay it on us you know if you want to Stick around in after

753
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,310
dark for a few minutes. Yeah. Yeah,

754
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,320
we'll go hang out for a little we'll chat about it All right.

755
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:32,520
We'll give it ten more seconds Then we got to go get some beer beer and editing

756
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,250
down on the off the dock We'll put up some pencils for the bugs, you know,

757
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,070
dude, I'm gonna layer up like crazy. Yeah, perfect. Let's end the poll.

758
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,970
Boom Everyone almost everyone got it, right?

759
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,740
So It is true that short sellers are very confident,

760
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,920
but that's that's really not the reason why it's dry It's going down right because

761
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,390
the ball rate is high for example Bill Ackman,

762
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:06,020
right Bill Ackman was super confident that HLF was going down in the movie was called

763
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,970
On his Herbalife Herbalife the Herbalife movie, right? He was confident in it,

764
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:16,710
but he wasn't big enough To move the whole market borrow rate was only like 15%

765
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:17,980
Right,

766
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,720
but this is because the ball rate is very high and that's why we were able to get

767
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,610
a good risk-reward Okay, next one Pull two.

768
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:37,720
I guess this was a little too easy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. How deep you went?

769
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,320
Yeah Yeah Okay,

770
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:57,200
so you guys get it you guys get it sick sick So so Danny high borrow rate actually

771
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,240
makes long-term investors More excited about holding their position because they

772
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,400
actually get to keep that premium.

773
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:10,140
So it doesn't necessarily make this stock go down But it does make the implied forward

774
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:15,460
go down It does make the future the mark because remember the market is just what

775
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,700
people think that's all it is So if everyone short the stock,

776
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,360
what does that mean?

777
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,550
It means people think in the future stocks are going down So that's what's gonna

778
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:32,310
happen options our future Spot is stocks are current, but there is you know,

779
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:38,460
some discounted cash in there Okay, super quick. Okay,

780
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,020
Bougie Bougie wants to know everyone got it, right, by the way Oh, yeah,

781
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,890
everyone got it, right. Great job guys Okay, Bougie quickly.

782
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:50,920
She wants to see not the money call They're still very cheap, right?

783
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,460
You can buy a $62 call super cheap You know,

784
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:02,000
it's $2 here at $17 Extrinsic on the put so these are super cheap If you get the

785
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,540
rip, you can make some huge money, right?

786
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,980
It's just I really like that leverage factor of nine to one on some of the trades

787
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,560
I was getting so I did decide to Do the vertical spread? Okay,

788
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,300
so Andreas is buying calls.

789
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,120
Oh, yeah. Okay mark. That's right.

790
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,100
I wanted to go over Lavelle's thing super quick So this is what Lavelle did she

791
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:36,410
did something like The 50-55 or something like this. So look at this.

792
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:44,660
Oops Okay You're collecting and I she got like some wicked price She did a $1 wide

793
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,260
and she got like 75 cents or something. So,

794
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,400
you know in these case scenarios Right as long as the stock stays above $51 you

795
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,740
get this If you oh, that's right, that's right Okay,

796
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,290
so Lavelle had this trade on and like when originally she sent it to me.

797
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:08,590
I said,

798
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:16,220
there's no way I said there's no effing way that she got this and So I was a little

799
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,160
skeptical about it I looked a little more into it,

800
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,260
you know we have there's a funny story about that. I'm not gonna go into it,

801
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,550
but You know if you guys want to hear it,

802
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:34,170
I'm sure Lavelle will chat with you about it. Okay. So here's her trade. Okay,

803
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:39,680
as long as the stock stays above 51 bucks She's gonna make 70 cents and the stock

804
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,500
goes below. She's gonna make 30 cents. So you guys can do the You know,

805
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,080
you guys can do it pretty simply your expected value right now.

806
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,900
Imagine if it's 50-50 Okay,

807
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,340
imagine if it's 50-50 what is her expected value on this trade?

you guys can reach out to her So yeah,

811
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:15,350
you know Betting on the stock going up you are getting a crazy crazy crazy risk

01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:18,120
reward scenario Right,

813
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:26,040
even in this case scenario for Lavelle's case the stock Can go down 10% 15% and

814
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,040
she'll still make money and not just money She'll make two and a half times her

815
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,360
risk.

know looking at some of these uh well,

819
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,160
actually Tico actually brought it to my attention.

820
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,560
He's actually in here It's cool actually brought to my attention and you know from

821
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,780
there just you go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole you try to play out the

822
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,990
scenario you try to play out the story and Then you just have to fucking pull the

823
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:06,920
trigger Okay, okay guys,

824
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:17,540
oh why don't you buy the call and sell the put oh I see I see I see I Didn't do

825
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:24,660
it just because The stock could go down Right the stock could go down and I'm on

826
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,940
the hook and so went down to 30 Went down to 30.

827
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,900
I wouldn't like that very much So instead structure a trade where I can get huge

828
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,980
huge risk reward on time Yeah,

829
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,740
and on top of defined and on top of that more margin efficient I like to put up

830
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,780
a dollar and sixty cents for some of these trades sixty cents and then a dollar

831
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:50,750
for the Seven and ten wide with this. I'd have to put up a lot of money. Okay.
