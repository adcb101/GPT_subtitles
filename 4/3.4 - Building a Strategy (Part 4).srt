1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,640
So, you guys know where we left off.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,580
We were looking at our straddle P&L as our target variable,

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,200
trying to basically create a system that can give us above and beyond returns over

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,500
that two and a half percent that we were seeing from the risk premium. So,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,910
I'm just going to give a summary of our target variable so we can get back on the

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,350
same page.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,880
So, as you guys can see, our mean is negative two and a half percent, right?

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,400
We're getting charged that risk premium for selling that risk.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,270
But we need to do much better.

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,970
And this is one of the biggest things that I think might affect other traders is

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,470
not knowing how big an edge needs to be to overcome costs, right?

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,150
A lot of the time, when you have brokerage fees, you have commissions,

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,070
you have slippage, and that's going to eat away at your profits.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,760
And most of the time, it's going to eat much more than your profits.

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,430
All right, thanks guys. Sean would have killed me there. All right, let's see.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,040
Recording in progress.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,020
So, we need much more, but how much more do we need? So,

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,900
what I thought was I was going to do,

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,760
basically, I started looking at my historical earning trades and I thought,

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,800
okay, well, what hurdle do we need to overcome?

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,180
And for some of the guys that are on here that are taking earnings to that next

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,420
level,

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,740
I'd love for you guys to actually input what you think the hurdle is that we need

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,320
to overcome. So, in this case, what I have is a 3% in, a 3% out,

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,620
and a half a percent in commissions, okay? So,

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,340
and this 3% is based on the straddle price, all right? So, let's say,

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,300
for example, in this case, let's say the mid of a straddle is $8, okay?

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,080
Because don't forget, we're working with the data,

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,740
and the data is going to be basically the mid, right? So,

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
if the mid of the straddle is $8,

31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,370
we're going to be basically spending 20 cents getting into the trade,

32
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,050
20 cents getting out of the trade, and then about, you know,

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,910
five or 10 cents for the commissions. So, for $8 straddle,

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,560
we're looking at about 50 cents in commissions. And so,

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,320
that's a total of six and a half percent that we need to overcome,

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,160
okay? So, from some of the other guys on here, Marjan, if you're on here,

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,970
if you could just, you know, let me know what your thoughts on this are. So,

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,660
six and a half hurdle, and right now, without just blindly selling vol,

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,780
we're actually losing 4% per trade,

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,140
okay? And this is what kills the traders, right?

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,620
We see a nice two and a half percent edge, and we say, hey, you know what,

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,580
let's just go and sell vol, we're going to make quite a bit of money.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,140
The issue is, you're actually in a negative spot. And this happens,

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,570
especially in options, because the bid-ask spreads are very wide.

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
And does anyone want to disagree with this statement?

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,350
Or does anyone think they have a better number here, a better hurdle number?

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,940
So, the next step we're going to do now is now that we know what our hurdle is,

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,260
basically,

49
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,940
anything above six and a half percent is going straight to our pockets.

50
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,980
So, what I first did was,

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,160
I want to make sure that this risk premium has always been there through time,

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,620
right? A lot of the times, maybe it just happened once, or, you know,

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,580
it happened maybe for a couple quarters, and then it was gone. So,

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,080
what we need to do is we need to make sure that it's actually happened consistently,

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,760
or maybe it hasn't happened consistently. So,

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,280
what I did actually was I got eight years of data. Okay,

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
so I know when Hutch sees this, he'll be pretty happy with it.

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,500
I pulled in eight years of data, and what I said was, basically,

59
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,400
only show me the data that has a tight bid-ask spread.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
And that's why I call this liquid ER.

61
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,700
And if we look at how many data points we have,

62
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,610
we have 17,000 events over an eight,

63
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,010
almost 18,000 events over an eight-year period. So, what I said was, okay,

64
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,190
let's look at our straddle P&L, and let's look at that through time.

65
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,650
So, here's what we have. And this graph is gonna come in handy later.

66
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,480
And just quickly looking at this, you can see the zero line up here. Oops,

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,300
sorry, guys.

68
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,330
Sorry, guys, that was a little bit of a spoiler. So, here it is right here,

69
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,450
all right? Here's our straddle P&L through time. And you can see, so,

70
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,130
for example, on this quarter, like 2013, you know, we were making,

71
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,490
we were losing 6% per quarter. And then we started making, you know,

72
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,150
2% per quarter here, if we're long the straddle. And then,

73
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,150
but now we're at this period where it's like,

74
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,600
the P&L is just getting sucked out of these straddles. So,

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,400
I wanna show you guys a post from our buddy, Ben. Okay,

76
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,280
which I think is a little bit ridiculous,

77
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,360
but we're gonna take a look at it anyways.

78
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,590
So, can you guys see my Twitter screen?

79
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,940
So, let me know if you guys can see my Twitter screen here.

80
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,760
Okay, great. So,

81
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,400
here's Ben posting the variance risk premium in selling equity fall, all right?

82
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,260
And you can see, so, you can see the zero line right here.

83
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,300
And what Ben is saying is like, there's a downtrend. This is since 1992. Now,

84
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,520
I really don't think there's a downtrend, but what we notice here, guys,

85
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,400
is like, you can basically see the cycles of variance risk premium.

86
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,560
You get a crash, variance risk premium is negative.

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,140
Then for the next five to 10 years, we start climbing, right,

88
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,980
and all of a sudden, you know, short sellers got blown out,

89
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,270
short vol traders got blown out of the water. And, you know,

90
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,250
all of a sudden selling vol is a huge, huge profitable strategy.

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,700
And what we're seeing here is kind of a similar thing, right, you can see like,

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,380
okay, 2013, 2015 to 2015, like really profitable.

93
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,100
Then it got like not profitable. Then we had the blowout, right?

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,660
And now all of a sudden vol is becoming extremely,

95
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,520
selling vol around earnings is becoming extremely profitable again.

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:07,820
So, you know, we can almost say that selling earnings vol is cyclical, okay?

97
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,780
You're gonna have a lot of short vol sellers come back into the market again,

98
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,960
let's say the next few years, and that's gonna drive down the risk premium,

99
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,980
right? And we can see that right here. Like, guys, for two years,

100
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,030
selling vol was not profitable before even we look at the commission structure,

101
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,410
okay? So just keep that in mind.

102
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,530
Blindly selling vol constantly is probably not gonna be profitable because you have

103
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,450
a 4% hurdle or sorry, a 6% hurdle.

104
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,210
And on top of that, you get years where it's like positive returns.

105
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,340
So selling vol could be extremely, extremely difficult.

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,880
Okay, so now something,

107
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,180
so now we come to the conclusion that we can't just sell vol, okay?

108
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,000
We're not gonna make any money. We're gonna lose money,

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,900
especially on a something where the holding period is a half day cycle.

110
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,660
You're holding overnight. The commission structure is huge.

111
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,160
The bid asks are huge.

112
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,540
So what we need to do is, oh, what I found, and this was actually unbelievable.

113
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,800
And it was unbelievable and unbelievably simple, okay?

114
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,670
If there is a vol drop, you're gonna earn. Let me say it again.

115
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,490
If there is a vol drop, you're gonna earn. And so sometimes we'll see,

116
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:45,850
let's say the implied move or the IV30 day at 60, the IV, sorry,

117
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,460
the IV30 day at 60, the IV60 day at 57. And there's an earnings event.

118
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,080
We wanna sell volatility. Well, the thing is,

119
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,550
you actually might not get the vol drop that you were anticipating. Well,

120
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,830
let's say for example, realize vol is above implied vol.

121
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:09,190
And so after the earnings event, the vol doesn't drop. So check this out, guys.

122
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,210
This is very exciting. What I did is I said, okay, look,

123
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,480
let's create this variable called vol drop, okay? And this basically says,

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,020
what in percentage was the change from yesterday to today? So let's say,

125
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,480
so this was the formula. Vol drop equals IV30 divided by, sorry,

126
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:45,200
IV30 tomorrow minus IV30 today. Okay, and then we divide that by IV30 today.

127
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,520
So it's just the delta.

128
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,560
Okay, so we'll do a quick example.

129
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,500
Let's say today the vol is 50% or tomorrow the vol is 50%.

130
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,470
Yesterday before the event, it was 60%, okay?

131
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,330
So that would be the formula. So tomorrow after the event, it goes to 50.

132
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,930
Yesterday it was 60 and yesterday it was 60.

133
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,360
And so that would give us 10 divided by 50.

134
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,140
This would be equivalent to a 16% drop in vols, okay? So it's not in vegas.

135
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
It's in percentage.

136
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,780
So that's what that is. And if we actually take a look at,

137
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,230
let's take a look at this variable because it's very important.

138
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,730
It's actually extremely important.

139
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,750
Look at this, guys. Most of the time there's a vol drop. Okay,

140
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,310
so here's the zero line right here, meaning no vol drop. You know,

141
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,470
sometimes vol increases after the event, rarely,

142
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,820
and most of the time it gets smoked, right? The IV crush,

143
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,000
whatever the retail call it. But what we're saying here is, okay,

144
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:19,460
let's at least give it a 10% drop, okay? So for example, it was 23 vol before.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,040
After the next day, it was 19%, right? On a 30-day option.

146
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:30,580
That means the event vol was 73%. And so the expected move was 3.5%, okay?

147
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,480
For this scenario, right? Sometimes, for example, it's, I don't know,

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,310
80 tomorrow and 88 yesterday, right? And you know,

149
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,290
you're still gonna get a similar, oops.

150
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,720
This one was a big one,

151
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,410
right? That was a big 10%. So you say, okay, let's at least have that.

152
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,470
And now let's take a look at our P&L,

153
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,480
okay? So here I plotted in blue without that filter over time.

154
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,220
One simple filter. And then I plotted the red. Red is after that filter.

155
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,590
And what we can see here is our P&L drastically increases in every single quarter,

156
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,440
okay? Now, I'm sure some of you guys are saying, well, hey, Jordan,

157
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,130
how do we know there's gonna be a vol drop, right? How,

158
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,950
if we know there's gonna be a vol drop, then our life gets a lot easier.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,340
And so that's the next thing, right?

160
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,080
How do we know there's gonna be a vol drop?

161
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,380
And there's two things that I found are the most important for the vol drop,

162
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,530
okay? One, and the Hutch might not agree with me, but I think after this slide,

163
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,300
he might start agreeing with me. One, IV needs to be bigger than RV.

164
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,990
The implied move could be 10%,

165
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,450
okay? The implied move can be 10%.

166
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,270
If the RV is higher than the current IV or the current non-event vol, okay?

167
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,510
Don't take the trade, okay? We basically wanna make sure that after this event,

168
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,440
IV is gonna get crushed. And if you guys go back to my 100K challenge,

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
I traded DRI,

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,840
and there was an example where the stock moved 3% after earnings and vol didn't

171
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,210
move, okay? If I had known that, I wouldn't have sold vol,

172
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,070
we would have been a profitable trade. So that's the first thing,

173
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,490
IV or the non-event vol,

174
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,810
the vol that you think this thing's gonna collapse to after the event,

175
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,410
needs to be greater than the RV, okay? In this case, I just did IV over RV.

176
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,030
There needs to be contango. I'm sorry, backwardation, whoops,

177
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,520
okay? There needs to be backwardation,

178
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,200
meaning the front needs to be higher than the back, okay?

179
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,560
And the back needs to be higher than the one after that.

180
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,450
So now,

181
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,870
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna apply a simple Aaron Brown method,

182
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,380
okay? We're gonna apply a very simple Aaron Brown method. So actually, sorry,

183
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,240
not just yet.

184
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,320
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plot three variables on their own. Contango,

185
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,990
IV, sorry, IV versus RV. So how big is IV versus RV?

186
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,850
The ones we just talked about here. And then the size of the move, okay?

187
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,230
So here we go, we're gonna plot the first one.

188
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,810
So here, okay, we can see that.

189
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,310
So what I did basically was I took the backwardation,

190
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,790
backwardation here equals IV30 divided by IV60, right?

191
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,380
And I ranked all of them in our data set. And I said, okay,

192
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,650
let's break them out into quantiles.

193
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,070
So let's just view our data here just so you guys were on the same page.

194
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,420
But we went over this the last two lives.

195
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,980
Okay, so for example, this one here, the IV30 is 11% greater than the IV60.

196
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:58,020
And so this goes into our seventh quantile. And this is 26% higher.

197
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,540
So it goes into our 10th percentile, okay?

198
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:09,160
So basically what we can see here is the higher the IV30 is over the 60,

199
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,710
aka steeper backwardation, okay? The worse the long straddle PNL is,

200
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,650
okay? So we're gonna get back to that in a second.

201
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:33,070
I will answer all those questions there, okay? So the higher the backwardation,

202
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,890
the higher our PNL. And we're gonna do the same for IV versus RV.

203
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,010
I love this one, guys. I love this one so much, okay?

204
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:46,540
And the reason I love this one is because you can see here, it's pretty stable.

205
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,580
Like when IV is just slightly over RV or IV is equal to RV or IV is below RV,

206
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,990
it's stable. And then like, look how quickly that melts off, right?

207
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,060
So we could see that, okay, well, basically, when IV is a lot higher than RV,

208
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,260
we're gonna earn,

209
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,880
okay? I'll go back over that in a second.

210
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,190
Yeah, I know, I have my windows open and like it's a busy street outside.

211
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,180
Okay, just joking. Sean's on the loose right now. Yeah, Rob got it. Okay, good,

212
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,880
good. Okay, so that's why I really like this IV versus RV, right?

213
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,490
The next thing is the implied move. We already went over this one.

214
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,550
The higher the implied move, the more our straddle PNL is.

215
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,110
Now this can of course be improved upon because Walmart at a 6% implied move,

216
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,220
it's huge. Shopify at a 6% move is not huge,

217
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,060
okay? This one is great as well, okay? Higher implied move,

218
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,580
the lower our long straddle PNL is gonna be.

219
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,290
So just to make sure everyone is aware, I'll write these out right here.

220
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,570
Contango equals F1 divided by F2, okay? So IV30 divided by IV60.

221
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:27,000
This is IV30 divided by RV30 or RV20, okay? And then this is implied move,

222
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,220
right? This has to do with the concept of shrinkage.

223
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,370
So now, this is the beautiful part.

224
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,600
We're gonna use Aaron Brown technique, which basically says, okay,

225
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,190
small things, small factors alone don't make a lot of money,

226
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,390
but together they make a ton of money.

227
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,530
So I did it. Adam, I didn't do that.

228
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,970
I don't, like there's gonna be,

229
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,950
like these variables are gonna be constantly changing and there's so many we can

230
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,070
do, so many we can test.

231
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,450
I don't know how far we wanna go with this because like this alone,

232
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,200
as we're gonna see right now, is gonna be a profitable system, okay?

233
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,970
So what I did here was I said, okay, look,

234
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,170
give me, I'm gonna filter for,

235
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,070
so all my indicators on their own are not gonna make us any money, right?

236
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,950
It might get us, let's say negative 4% or negative 3%,

237
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,650
but it's not gonna get us past that 6.5% hurdle by themselves.

238
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,440
So what I said was I said, okay, look, let's take all our data set,

239
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,320
18,000 variables, 18,000 observation,

240
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,820
and I want the ones that have above average backwardation,

241
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,700
above average IB versus RB, and above average implied move, no,

242
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,080
above the average implied move number. Okay, like, so for example,

243
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,000
I was actually long vol on ADBE today.

244
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,640
Basically, it was $15 in debit and was able to offset all my,

245
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,680
basically get out at 17.50. I sold all my deltas when it touched 567.50,

246
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,210
just based off this simple model. And that was a long vol play,

247
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,070
not a short vol play.

248
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,920
So we're taking the above average for just the three variables that we looked at

249
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,640
here. And now let's take a look at this, guys. This is very exciting.

250
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,900
Our mean return now passes our hurdle, okay? Seven, negative seven,

251
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,260
the straddle, if we're a shorting vol, the straddle loses 7% on average,

252
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
which is half a percent higher than our hurdle,

253
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,440
aka this is a profitable system.

254
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,050
Now, one thing that we need to be concerned about is, well, what is our,

255
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,510
how many bets do we have? Right, well, what if we only have five bets?

256
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,860
So we can take a look here. We have 4,400 bets, okay?

257
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:30,700
So basically 25% of our quarterly bets, okay? And you can see here, if I do,

258
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,980
you can see here, if I do,

259
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,270
okay?

260
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,540
Check this out, guys. Let's do tail,

261
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,500
okay? Because we have less events to begin.

262
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,800
So we're doing about six to 800 bets a quarter, okay? Without any filters.

263
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,160
We add the filters, we're doing 25%.

264
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,860
So we're basically doing 200 bets to 150 bets a quarter. And of course,

265
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,680
you probably still wanna refine that, get that number up to 10%.

266
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,460
That's where I'm trying to head to.

267
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,400
Now, what we're gonna do now is we're gonna plot a P&L.

268
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,270
So the first one we're gonna do is we're gonna plot the PA straddle P&L. Now,

269
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,900
as you can see, this looks fantastic. This is without the 4% hurdle, okay?

270
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,830
If I took away the 4% or the 6%, let's see how I can do this here,

271
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,290
times negative one minus 0.06,

272
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,550
okay? There we go. Here is our P&L for the strategy, all right?

273
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,740
Now let's look at this one. Without any filters, we hit all the bets. Well,

274
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,880
this one makes like two times as much money,

275
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:21,110
but once

276
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,370
we take that out, once we take out that 6% all of a sudden,

277
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:32,370
this becomes a terrible strategy, right? And you can see our P&L,

278
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:40,700
when we filter for better names, we get a less smaller standard deviation.

279
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,780
And so our Sharpe ratio is gonna be much higher.
