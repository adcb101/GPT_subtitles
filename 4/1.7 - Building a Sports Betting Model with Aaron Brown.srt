1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,350
Well, hey guys, happy Thanksgiving to everyone In this live,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,210
we're actually going to be talking about one of my favorite papers of all times

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,590
It's Aaron Brown and his sports betting model how he basically built a football

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,250
model that did extremely well over over a five-year period and what actually went

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,470
into his his model,

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:30,170
so Aaron Brown for those who that don't know is the risk manager at AQ are No,

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,450
no,

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,450
okay risk manager is the manager of the portfolio managers determines who gets what

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,670
capital what they can do yeah, so he's like the you know,

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,110
there's the If if you're if your hedge fund was a chess board, he's the king.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,950
Yes.

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,860
He is the guy and now he He's finished with a QR now and now he is just on the board

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:57,720
of directors for for the firm But he is one of the best traders of all times And

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,540
here's the good thing about him not working there anymore He basically spends his

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,520
entire day on Quora answering questions and giving value and giving away secrets

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,800
as well Remember like he's um, he did he doesn't need any more money anymore,

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,080
right?

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:15,050
He's made hundreds of millions and So he can give back to the community now,

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,490
right and he actually probably it's a lot of joy out of you know Helping young quants

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,710
and he does that now, right?

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,530
He he is now a professor at University of Chicago and he He tries to help young

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,210
quants Turn him to traders. Yeah real traders,

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,110
right and and really and maybe not in that sense Like I want to make these guys

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,590
a lot of money,

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,030
but in the sense of I want them to build To help grow the financial world right

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,230
help grow the financial economy.

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,900
We can never forget guys that When a good trader comes into the market,

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,950
he makes the market more efficient Okay,

29
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,030
he hits he he discovers miss miss pricings and he makes the market more and for

30
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:59,390
me More efficient Meaning the pension the the person who is investing in a mutual

31
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,930
fund the person who is you know Buy and hold will always get a better price okay,

32
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,150
so By investing in really good quants.

33
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,990
The quant is gonna make a lot of money or the trader is gonna make a lot of money

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,290
But in doing so he's gonna make the market a lot more efficient He's gonna provide

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,370
a service for the person on the other side of the trade Okay,

36
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,130
and just a quick example of to see this is imagine there were no people trying to

37
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:35,130
take advantage of misinformation or inefficiencies in the market You know the person

38
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,390
who's investing in their pension fund Well that pension fund is gonna have to pay

39
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,540
a huge bid ask spread Right. So these people make the market more efficient.

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,320
Okay,

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,470
so with that said we're gonna jump into it and I'm just going to quickly show To

42
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:05,600
a little a tweet that I think I don't get a lot of information from Okay,

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,940
so This guy named Darren He's saying and remember guys I have nothing against these

44
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,640
people personally like I'm sure a lot of them are actually very good people But

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,610
at the same time when we're on Twitter or wherever we are We need to learn from

46
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,950
people who know what they're doing, right?

47
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,890
And this is why we're gonna go over go over Aaron Brown's paper today But we can't

48
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,950
always just be looking at Aaron Brown stuff We need to be able to figure out who

49
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,670
should we who should we be listening to? Okay,

50
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,090
so in this example This guy named Darren who's actually pretty popular on Twitter.

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,570
He said basically I'm always look like I'm looking for these Trade examples that

52
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,690
have an R squared of 0.9 Okay,

53
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:50,970
and what that really means is I can explain 90% of the variance I can really explain

54
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,860
S&P's price tomorrow with almost certainty. Okay,

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,760
and The reality is if that was the case,

56
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:06,530
you would be richer than Jeff Bezos in no time right in a very quick period So we

57
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:14,270
always have to be aware guys that when we see things like this We need to say,

58
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,690
okay Well,

59
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,950
who are they quoting who are they learning from and we can write those people off,

60
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:19,350
right?

61
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,870
One of the biggest things in trading is to be able to write people off and to listen

62
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,150
to the good people That's probably the whole the whole point not the whole point

63
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,710
But the whole battle in trading right if you're learning from the right people,

64
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,650
you're gonna get to the end goal a lot quicker Okay,

65
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,320
so I just want to quickly quickly mention that and we're gonna head over to the

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:51,190
paper, okay, so Aaron Brown wrote a paper about His football bets, okay,

67
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,890
so he started he was creating a model. What year is this? Oh,

68
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,730
this is recently 2017 He wrote this in 2017.

69
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,270
So he was doing it from 2012 to 2017. Correct? Cool.

70
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,180
So he wrote this paper in 2017 and Basically,

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,590
what he tried to do is explain How he built a strategy in in football that worked

72
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,730
for five years And The beauty about this paper guys,

73
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,890
and this is gonna tie back into well what I was just showing you about the r-squared

74
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,430
Okay,

75
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,670
so And we're actually gonna be talking a little bit a little bit about the r-squared

76
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,580
in this paper So slow me down guys if you think I'm going a little too fast a Lot

77
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,680
of people think in trading you need to you know,

78
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,650
be able to forecast the future extremely well Okay,

79
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,730
and the reality is you don't okay.

80
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:55,450
So an r-squared of 0.9 For example means you can forecast the future very well in

81
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,070
Trading in reality. There's so much noise in trading, right?

82
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,600
You only need to forecast the future by a very very small margin Okay,

83
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,920
extremely small you only need in other words You only need a really really small

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,220
edge.

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,390
And so what Aaron Brown did was basically create a system that only won 55% of the

86
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,740
time Okay, let's sit down for a second because let's really think about it.

87
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,710
Yeah Imagine a game where you bet one if you win you make one if you lose you lose

88
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,350
your one So risk reward is 1-1 and you had a 51% chance of winning. Okay,

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,530
is that not enough to get rich? Think about it.

90
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,460
Let's say you had a thousand dollars to start with can't you and you can bet as

91
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,480
frequently as you want.

92
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,760
Mm-hmm Can't you set up a system where that million dollar or one dollar turns a

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,610
thousand dollars turns into a hundred million dollars Can't we like actually statistically

94
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,310
come up with something that that happens. Isn't that what a casino does?

95
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,850
Because you know says we have a bankroll of a hundred million dollars.

96
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,320
We have 50 roulette tables running We have a 2% advantage right 52% chance of winning

97
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,620
We won the one risk reward and yet they turn it into millions and millions of dollars

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,740
We don't need to have that,

99
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,220
you know hearing that 90% hit rate and stuff That's a retail phenomena because it

100
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,000
gives people a sense of comfort and confidence when they can't explain the math

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,760
behind it Right hearing 51% chance doesn't doesn't sound like a lot of confidence

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,100
if you know,

103
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,570
it's 51 There's actually a lot of confidence And we really need to understand that

104
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,370
that's actually really good points like the tasty trade like Probability of profit.

105
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,850
Yeah, we're option off of probability of profit This is a retail phenomenon,

106
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,010
right? It's uh,

107
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,870
it's something that we shouldn't be looking at as a trader At the end of the day

108
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,790
as a trader, we don't we don't care about the probability of winning, right?

109
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,150
Why don't we just go sell lottery tickets?

110
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,210
We care about the expected value care about the expected value and selling lottery

111
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,690
tickets would actually be great money Well, yeah, it's not a lot of tickets,

112
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,170
but the probability of profits huge, right? Yeah,

113
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,980
you know probably profits you yeah So, what did Aaron Brown go and do well,

114
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,480
he created the system Okay,

115
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,600
that 155 and also if probability of profit was all that mattered long ball wouldn't

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,000
exist.

117
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,930
Exactly That's a very true right long ball as a strategy would not exist because

118
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,030
you you win very little Very little time. Oh,

119
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,610
you looked at it was probability of profit Even buy and hold equity might not make

120
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,410
sense Every year it's you know, you know, you make money most years,

121
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,910
but is it 90% probably not maybe it's a little bit higher Last ten years it has

122
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,160
been but that's a good point Yeah,

123
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,370
probably 70% It's that really good probability of profit So so Aaron Brown basically

124
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,570
did this one-to-one risk reward scenario in football where he had a 55% chance of

125
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,770
winning And he did extremely well with it.

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
Now the beauty of this article though,

127
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,360
and this article taught me so much When I started trading it the beauty of this

128
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,220
article is how we came up to this 55% So a lot of a lot of the time guys,

129
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,530
we will think like there's this one indicator That's gonna give us a 55% edge Okay,

130
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,210
there's this one thing that's gonna give us that 5% edge,

131
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:28,320
but in the reality There's not okay There are a few small indicators That when combined

132
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,720
give you a huge edge.

133
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,190
So do you want to maybe explain like the term factor based model? Yep Right.

134
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,530
So this is kind of like a factor based model that you're creating Yeah,

135
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,980
so you're gonna have let's say a couple factors right factor one is Okay,

136
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,200
let's use this as an example imagine you're looking at you're a car insurance company,

137
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,700
okay,

138
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:58,330
and you're trying to evaluate someone and You you you you look at only one factor,

139
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,250
which is Speeding tickets. Okay,

140
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,630
you look at speeding to how many how many speeding tickets does this person have?

141
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,290
Well,

142
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:12,150
you might have someone who's 50 years old got four speeding tickets when they were

143
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,210
in their 20s hasn't had a speeding ticket in 30 years and you're gonna be comparing

144
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,970
that person to somebody who's You know calling them equivalent to someone who's

145
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,850
25 and has four for speeding tickets or you know Someone who's gotten one every

146
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,110
10 years over 40 years,

147
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,450
but these people aren't all equivalent But number of speeding tickets might still

148
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,940
have some correlation with likelihood of a crash So what if you started to combine

149
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,760
more than one thing?

150
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,540
What if you looked at number of speeding tickets you looked at age?

151
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,400
You you looked at accident history you looked at the type of car they drive You

152
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,840
look at where you know, like a whole bunch of factors, right? well,

153
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,200
all of a sudden if you have one of them,

154
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,500
it's like we know that it's correlated,

155
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,240
but it's not like Everything we have all these other things But if you saw all of

156
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,840
them a certain way,

157
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,620
like the guys had five previous accidents is for speeding tickets He's 23 years

158
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,270
old he drives a Ferrari It's funny cuz I'm actually describing someone I know right

159
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:15,750
now. It's really funny but Describing us. I know describing us man But uh,

160
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,150
you see how all of a sudden we have a lot more confidence that this is somebody

161
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,740
who may not be the best Person to insure, you know what? I mean,

162
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,300
or we see the person's had four speeding tickets, but they're 60 You know,

163
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,200
they're 50 years old. They drive,

164
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,950
you know a Honda Civic they've had no accidents and You know,

165
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,150
all of a sudden it's two different pictures, right?

166
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,450
Also in something seems a lot more insurable than the other and what we call this

167
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,170
is a factor based model where we find a bunch of different things that are correlated

168
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,270
with What we're trying to figure out and we weigh them against each other To come

169
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,100
up with a better picture of what we're trying to look at So that's a car insurance

170
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,520
example,

171
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,100
and I'm assuming I haven't read this paper as in-depth as you but that's what's

172
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,760
happening here. Yeah,

173
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,900
and The better the factor the better of the model we're gonna better better the

174
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,350
factor the better the model Let's say for example right now nobody has figured out

175
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:15,960
that smoking causes more more car accidents Yeah, okay,

176
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:23,370
but as a trader or as a let's say a new a new pension fund you figure out that Smoking

177
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,110
causes car accidents. Well,

178
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,990
you can add that to your model now Right and now you can give better rates and that's

179
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,190
gonna make you more competitive and that's gonna be able to make you more money

180
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,110
Okay, so that's basically what we're gonna be talking about here.

181
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,070
This was huge huge huge in my growth So two things guys as we go through this I

182
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,470
want you guys to think of two two things.

183
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:55,590
Okay one You usually can't explain the outcome very well So very you can only explain

184
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,830
a very little bit of it You can a very little bit you can only explain very little

185
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,130
of it okay,

186
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,420
that's the first thing and then the second thing is the better the indicator the

187
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,960
better the result the more creative the Indicator and the better it is the better

188
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,690
the result. Okay, and Just to touch on when you say creative.

189
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,110
It has to make sense. Yeah,

190
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,510
right creative Is a good word like or like novel Right,

191
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,910
it has to be something a different lens that you're looking at it Maybe but it still

192
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,790
has to make sense. So for you know, for example,

193
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,610
you can't be saying the you know,

194
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:40,550
the number of forks in someone's cutlery set at home is correlated with their driving

195
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,710
record unless it's all knives in which case they might be crazy and you know bad

196
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,710
driver, but Besides that you can't actually quote, you know,

197
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,600
it needs to make sense Right. So keep that in mind too. So here we go.

198
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:59,140
So Quick quick summary 55% but each indicator only gave let's say 51% Okay,

199
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,470
I'm gonna add it all together you get 55 So first indicator over reaction,

200
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:16,440
okay So what he basically did was he said okay,

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,280
well Imagine guys Green Bay is gonna pit is gonna play I don't okay.

202
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,680
I honestly don't know football that well.

203
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,120
Can someone just comment to football teams in here?

204
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:35,130
No Ravens in Green Bay, you know the Ravens and Patters. Yeah, okay So, okay,

205
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,980
we were the guys are saying Cowboys and the Bears Okay,

206
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,260
so chicks don't kill me man.

207
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,940
So imagine the Cowboys are playing the Bears and they're playing tomorrow night

208
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,710
Okay,

209
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:59,140
and tonight We say that there is a 55% chance or let's say 70% chance that That

210
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,380
the Cowboys beat the Bears,

211
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,940
so let me just let me do a new screen share here So we can you guys can see what

212
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,380
I'm talking about here. What are you trying to draw? I'm gonna draw a timeline.

213
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:16,020
Okay Okay, so Okay, imagine we are here. Okay guys,

214
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:23,720
and this is this is today Tomorrow is game night. We'll call it GN.

215
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:34,270
Okay, and on GN we have the Bears vs the Cowboys okay,

216
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,950
and The Cowboys today We think is a 70% favorite.

217
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,150
Okay,

218
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:54,610
so we think tonight the Cowboys are a 70% favorite now Let's say the Bears win.

219
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,540
Okay, let's say the Bears win tonight So Bears so we have the night here. Boom.

220
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,340
Boom. It happens and Bears win.

221
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,850
So we'll label that Bears Well now in the future okay,

222
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:19,790
they're playing again and because the Bears won against the Cowboys The odds have

223
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,140
been shifted. It is now 50-50 Okay,

224
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:36,610
it is now 50-50. Well, we can say this there was an overreaction Okay,

225
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:43,740
meaning before before we saw this game it was 30-70 Okay before we saw that game.

226
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:52,180
It was 30-70 Once we saw the game The odds went 50-50 for the next time.

227
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,290
They're gonna play Well, we can say there was an overreaction Okay,

228
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,170
and this can be like in an earnings event. Okay,

229
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:07,630
let's say for example on average the company moves five percent Okay,

230
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,990
so let's say the earnings date so this is today and this is the earnings date Okay,

231
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:21,310
and we say well the implied move on for fair value should be 5% and then on earnings

232
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,400
day It moves 20% Okay,

233
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:35,050
and so because it moved 20% the next earnings date the implied move is 15% Okay

234
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,490
Well,

235
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:42,790
we could say that this is an overreaction and it is probably a lot closer to this

236
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:49,780
5% number Okay, does everyone understand that?

237
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,630
Does everyone understand that one? What was the cue?

238
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,750
the question oh It was just which Give me a football team. Okay,

239
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,550
so we all understand this one Let's keep going. Okay,

240
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:18,880
so that is the overreaction Right, he's quantifying that overreaction. Yes.

241
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,960
So he's saying, you know,

242
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,620
we're not gonna go over the quantum quantification That's you know,

243
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,960
that'll be for you guys to do in your spare time and I'll send you guys the paper

244
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,520
But basically like this right for example Suppose Green Bay play Chicago in week

245
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:37,260
7 before the games of week 6 We would have expected Green Bay to be a 3.5 favorite

246
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,260
But after the week 6 results Green Bay is now a 1.5 favorite.

247
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,510
Okay We're gonna guess that this is an overreaction. Okay,

248
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,540
and he's saying that this is a very reliable signal and It's basically because of

249
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,590
this. Okay, he basically says And this is a concept of shrinkage.

250
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,810
We're not gonna get too much into it today But we are going to talk a little bit

251
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:06,430
about it What he's basically saying is the the the spread went from here to here

252
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,340
Okay went from here to here and from it going from here to here Was two components

253
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,620
One component was signal. So yes, you know,

254
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,920
the stock did move 15% after earnings There should be maybe a little bit of a structural

255
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,800
change That's the signal but there's also an overreaction right and the noise the

256
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
extra bit Right,

257
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,380
and that is what he is saying here a little bit of a tricky concept if you guys

258
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:44,860
have any questions We'll chat about it a little more and Then there's actually a

259
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,000
lot more nuances in this paper if you guys want to read it.

260
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,020
It's really exciting It's very very very exciting. Another thing.

261
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,540
He says here basically is that the market makers, right?

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,440
They are going to overreact.

263
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,140
So if they get a whole bunch of Money being poured at them in one direction.

264
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,980
They're going to adjust their book even further Because you know,

265
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,700
they don't have to switch to the other side if they're wrong, right?

266
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,660
They can always just lean on this right and and that's the concept of this It's

267
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,320
a really good read guys, and I highly recommend you guys read it,

268
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,640
okay, so Here's this other example, right? Here's this other factor.

269
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,210
So we're going through factors. First factor is the overreaction factor. Okay?

270
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:45,480
so the second factor is Every reaction has a predictable overreaction Okay,

271
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,620
and this was okay,

272
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,420
this is a very cool concept and What Aaron what what is actually happening here

273
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:04,460
is we just so what's actually happening in the in this in this factor,

274
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:11,170
which is That every overreaction has a predict every what do you call it?

275
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,870
Every reaction has a predictable overreaction. Okay,

276
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,620
and what this is saying is that imagine guys Okay,

277
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,080
who is like a really broke football team or a really broke a basketball team?

278
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,000
Was the Raptors for a while, okay,

279
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:39,050
so imagine like two years ago Raptors was playing in in LA the Hornets They sound

280
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,750
they sound pretty much they actually sound super okay,

281
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,170
so Marcus imagine the Hornets were playing in LA Lakers Okay.

282
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:53,780
Now let now let's just think about the situation for a second you have a very wealthy

283
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,870
team Playing at home. Well,

284
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,450
there's gonna be a lot of money coming in betting on LA Lakers Right.

285
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,630
Everyone's going to the game. They're all betting on LA Lakers, right?

286
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,670
They they want to see their team win while they're at the game Right,

287
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,230
or they're you know,

288
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,950
they're playing at home Everyone's telling their friends are going to the bars and

289
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,330
they got the got the money on LA Lakers Right.

290
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,270
So what's gonna happen and what Aaron Brown saying here is there is this?

291
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,800
home-field advantage Okay,

292
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,460
I know a home-field advantage home field It's gonna be skewed too much Okay,

293
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,140
so if LA Lakers is playing the Hornets, right?

294
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,180
There's not a lot of money being bet on the Hornets, right?

295
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,070
who you know the I don't know where they're from, but the the team is broke.

296
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,110
They don't have a lot of money being behind them and so Who is gonna be betting

297
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,530
on those odds, right?

298
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,750
Who's gonna be pushing that not a lot of people yet All the retail everyone else

299
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,990
is gonna be betting on LA Lakers Okay,

300
00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:00,090
so for that reason you're gonna have this skew Or you're gonna have this skew Pushed

301
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,060
into LA Lakers and so what Aaron Brown saying is bet against that underdog right

302
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,200
You know,

303
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,700
there's gonna be too much money being pushed into the home field Especially if it's

304
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,360
a wealthy team,

305
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,610
it's sort of like getting a one three two fly Exactly a super cheap bet with a high

306
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,170
payoff That's a really good way to say you only got a hit at 10% of the time Yeah,

307
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,970
so that that's another factor that he adds into the model. Okay,

308
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:33,480
so let's get back here. Let me share my screen again Okay,

309
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:41,190
so he calls this a power rating and he says it's It's basically it's this is what

310
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,150
he calls the home field advantage. Okay?

311
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:59,570
Okay, next. Okay. There's this rematch this rematch one where Okay,

312
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,740
this one we're not gonna go too much into detail What's it about what's the gist

313
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,020
of it?

314
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,260
It's basically like It's basically like what we talked about in the first in the

315
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,730
first In the first example,

316
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,770
but it's a little different I did it more specific for a rematch,

317
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,330
but you could do it for not for rematch,

318
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,160
but we'll so we're just gonna skip over it Okay.

319
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,760
So then what he basically does is he gathers a whole bunch of data? Okay,

320
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,720
and each predictor,

321
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:41,680
okay Is very small right it has about 51% edge but combined they got 53.5% probability

322
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:49,060
which is above his 52% for a single factor. Okay, so For a single factor is 52,

323
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,820
but when combined with those three we get 53 and a half,

324
00:24:51,920 --> 00:25:04,930
but he keeps adding so this is this concept of Okay, this is actually okay.

325
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,410
We're gonna skip over a couple of the factors here guys You guys can read over it

326
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,590
a whole bunch of factors. Yeah,

327
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,290
I really like this one here So he basically goes from 53 and a half.

328
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,150
He adds a couple more factors and gets to 55 I really like these two guys.

329
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,240
So we're gonna go over this one and feeding the hungry because Okay,

330
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,280
because he and I really want you guys to really embrace these next two factors They're

331
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,680
really gonna change your mind on how on how you think about trading.

332
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,190
Okay, you know what?

333
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,830
We're just gonna go to feed the hungry because this one is my favorite Okay,

334
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,600
so basically guys If a team is consistently losing,

335
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,680
okay So let's say we're gonna I'm gonna stop my shirt stop sharing for a second

336
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,710
and we're gonna go dive into the factor We're gonna think of actually in terms of

337
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,930
the bookie I want you I really really want you guys to pay attention here because

338
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,630
this is trading in a nutshell This is trading at the highest level here. Okay?

339
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,840
I want you to think about yourself as a bookmaker Okay,

340
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,180
and you are making the spreads. Okay. Well, there's a guy Okay,

341
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,920
he has you know, he's got a wonderful family.

342
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,180
He's out in He's out in Missouri and he loves betting on football Okay,

343
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,540
and every single week he bets on his team. He bets on his team winning. Okay?

344
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,820
Now if that guy is losing all the time, he's gonna stop trading.

345
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,750
He is gonna stop Paying me commissions. I don't want that. I want him to win.

346
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,830
I want him to keep winning I want him to keep I don't want to keep winning.

347
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:59,870
I want him to win every so often so that I Can keep him coming back every single

348
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:05,750
day for more? Okay, and this is what the market makers do. Okay,

349
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,830
they're saying in this in this factor. It's called feeding the hungry Okay,

350
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,650
this guy every single week.

351
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,330
He's he's betting on the Hornets He's been on the Hornets every single week and

352
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,920
he's losing Because they suck I'm sorry.

353
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,040
There's a if there's any hornets fan here I have no clue but Marcos made it sound

354
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,860
like they they're a bad team. So I'm gonna go with Marcos You know,

355
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,760
they're not a good team.

356
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:39,020
And so I have to as a market maker shift those odds Give that guy sometimes some

357
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,500
juice Right sometimes some juice so that he can come back and bet more again Okay,

358
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,120
and I want you guys to stop for a second and think about all the traders out there

359
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,180
Who are thinking in terms of the guy from Missouri?

360
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,640
He's they're sitting there saying this is going up.

361
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,410
This stock is breaking out to new highs And on the other side of that trade is a

362
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,090
guy sitting there Saying I'm gonna let you win every so often.

363
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:10,350
I just want you guys to think about that for a second That is the game we play Okay,

364
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,750
that's the game that we play somebody is on the other side of our trade Saying no

365
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,600
problem. I'm gonna let you win every so often,

366
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,300
but I know That you're gonna lose all your money and the guy on the other side of

367
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,180
it of the table is Studying and trying to find those breakouts.

368
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,400
It's brutal Right. Just think about that for a second.

369
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:37,240
That is actually the game we play Okay and so that is that is what this factor is

370
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,500
what this factor is basically saying is After four losses if a team loses four times

371
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,720
in a row We're gonna we're gonna bet on them. Okay,

372
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,780
we're gonna if they lose four times in a row We're gonna bet on them because the

373
00:28:51,780 --> 00:29:01,160
market makers are going to start adjusting it so that these guys have the odds So

374
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,060
there's actually book. Yeah,

375
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,460
that's actually a really good point You might want to clarify what you're saying

376
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,560
there so remember guys,

377
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,960
it's we're not saying it's it this is this is so crucial Okay,

378
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,120
we're not saying the market makers are gonna do this So this like this is the real

379
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,380
odds The market makers are gonna do this, right?

380
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,940
And this is a huge mistake in trading that like I'm gonna know for certainty or

381
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm gonna know with 90% of the time Well, I'm gonna know with you know,

382
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,500
a thousand percent of the time. It's a little tweaks to the Eevee.

383
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,100
It's Exactly it's a tiny tweak to the Eevee and you know,

384
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,260
let's say not all the market makers are doing it but some of them are doing it and

385
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:45,960
it's just that tiny tweak to the Eevee because think about this like If you you

386
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,720
know a lot of people who they focus on risk management Well,

387
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,940
you know something I say to people who are I'm like,

388
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,230
can you risk manage your way to success at a roulette table? No,

389
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:00,790
all you can do is bleed out slower because you have negative Eevee So imagine there's

390
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,950
a really negative Eevee situation Well,

391
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,840
if you went in there and instantly lost half your money You'd you'd take the other

392
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,720
half your money and leave but what if I tweaked what I'm willing to offer you a

393
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,360
bit that gives you a little bit better Eevee and Keeps you in the game a bit longer

394
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,480
Maybe I maybe I end up leaving with 80% of your money in the long run because I

395
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,180
gave you a little bit more and You have winners Right,

396
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,180
one of the what is it we're excited We're doing some studying on what makes a game

397
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:39,450
addicting and one of the things was perceived skill a lot of near misses and winners

398
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,610
You need to have winning situations.

399
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,510
You have a lot of winning situations more losers than winners though You have a

400
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:51,060
lot of near misses like I just missed it like It was a false breakout Looking back.

401
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,870
I can see it now Perceived skill more chart time equals more money made Right and

402
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,070
and as the game maker,

403
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,530
right if I'm playing against that person and I have more knowledge and and more

404
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,670
skill I can set I you know,

405
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:12,950
like a market maker can change what they offer To keep it more intriguing.

406
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,630
Yeah,

407
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,740
and it happens It actually happens and if you even if it would make sense that it

408
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,220
happens if you look at the books as well there's actually a few few market makers

409
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:28,450
that actually Run the show think about this when we Back to the JD trade.

410
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,400
Mm-hmm if we came in and instantly dumped 200 lots on them the market maker gets

411
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,500
out so we sit there and go what can I do with this guy?

412
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,880
To increase my EV and to milk get more money out of this guy.

413
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,260
That's a really points Well,

414
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,540
right we do that when we are in the driver's seat when we've got the winning hand

415
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,630
We're trying to maximize our P&L and even if that means not coming in hard Right

416
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,290
easing our way into positions or even guys letting orders sit Yeah,

417
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:03,110
or even remember we talked about the Norwegian guys They would actually hit the

418
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,910
guy so he would back off and then come in with a whole bunch of orders on this side

419
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,670
Oh, yeah No, Kim,

420
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,450
right Everyone tries to do different things to get the most value out of someone

421
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:19,690
else and that's really what this is saying. Yep And then okay,

422
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,270
so let me just share my screen again And there's one more actually guys that we're

423
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,070
gonna go back to that.

424
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,240
You guys are really gonna like as well So that's that's the squeaky.

425
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,700
That's the feeding the hungry. Okay,

426
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,540
I highly recommend you guys go and you got a key You got to keep the suckers in

427
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:38,990
the game simply put because that's you know, like you know,

428
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,310
imagine you were like a really good poker player and you went into a room with like

429
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,970
a whole bunch of You know rich businessmen in Vegas enjoying a few drinks at the

430
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,050
table Well,

431
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,850
you're not gonna come in and fucking put your world poker to a bracelet on the table

432
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,640
You know, you're gonna try and you know,

433
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,920
you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna play a game with these guys Knowing that

434
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,070
in the long run you're gonna win and I really want this last conclusion guys to

435
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,270
really sit with you And this is what from one of the one of the smartest most wealthiest

436
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,770
traders of all times I'm really want this sync with you.

437
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,960
Okay And don't read it.

438
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,460
Let's listen to listen to the wonderful voices over here. Okay?

439
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,060
The point of all this that why he did this and why he did so well with this is that

440
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,040
it's easy to beat the Bookie or the market or the house or City Hall?

441
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:36,130
You use simple quantitative methods You don't need fancy math or inside information

442
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,810
or rare insights You get a small edge not the kind of certainty too many people

443
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:47,830
claim which we just talked about earlier But an edge that can produce Reliable profits

444
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,400
over a long period of time. Okay.

445
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,900
Now he now he does go and say you can build better models Let's say 58 59 percent,

446
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:03,310
but those require a lot of work. Okay, but it's easy And I wouldn't say easy.

447
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,290
It's I think when he says easy,

448
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:11,920
I think he means like it's not like it's not booty Exactly it's this is not black

449
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,900
magic. Yeah,

450
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,820
this is something that exists well within the realm of human capabilities it has

451
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,740
for a long time and it's There for you if you acquire those skills and apply it

452
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,420
to this game. That's exactly what he's saying, right?

453
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,920
It's easy to do well in a math test you study you listen in class and you come in

454
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,880
right? So that's it No, you're shit Go from there Right,

455
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,260
and I think this is a huge thing.

456
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:41,230
He says here the difference is quantity not quality Once you have the skills and

457
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,550
you know what you're doing Like there's so many different things you can try.

458
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,440
There's so many different indicators and there's creativity right,

459
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,520
but it's not like like think about for you like Looking for earnings factors.

460
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,680
Yeah, how many factors did you look at thousands hundreds literally hundreds?

461
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,860
Tested all of them back tested every single one found a couple found a couple.

462
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,670
That's not quality of work. That's quantity of work Yeah,

463
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,630
the quality is the skill set. Yeah,

464
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,320
the quantity is there are way too many combinations To think that you're gonna try

465
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
one and it's gonna work that's why I like, you know,

466
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,580
sometimes some guys in the group be like Here's an indicator that I used to use

467
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,440
back in the day or that someone told me about can you test it for me?

468
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,800
And I'm like before I even look at it I know it's probably not gonna work because

469
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,020
what are the odds exactly?

470
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,800
There's just the odds that it worked knowing that it's coming from a guy who?

471
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,060
