1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
All right, everyone,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,600
today we're going to be looking over a trade that came to my attention recently,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,010
and it's VXX SPY relative value trade. I just thought I'd go, you know,

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,150
through my thought process with you guys and also, you know,

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,410
what the trade looks like.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,740
And just like basically break it down for you guys to see like maybe what's going

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,660
on in my head sometimes.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,490
So with that said, let me just share my screen and we'll jump right into it.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,560
You should be able to.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,700
All right.

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,530
So, the trade is VXX SPY. And first, you know, you guys probably saying like,

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,150
how did I come up with this? Well,

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,870
the first thing I did was I scanned for the most,

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,010
the highest implied vol for the one year options, which I was looking for.

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:05,400
So let me just write that in there. The thought process was implied vol,

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,080
one year, looking for the highest in terms of percentile.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,100
So where is it right now versus where is it usually? And let me just,

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,390
I'll draw that out here. Let me just draw that out.

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,190
So if the implied volatility looks like this,

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,400
I scanned on the one year implied vol for options that are up here,

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,200
for implied volatility that's up here.

22
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,110
And VXX came on the radar.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,680
So the first I did was I said, okay,

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,120
let me let me plot the implied volatility of the VIX, of the one year options.

25
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,580
Okay, so it came up my radar. So let me take a look at this.

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,420
And here's what we notice, right?

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,850
The one year implied volatility is as high as it was during COVID,

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,510
which is insane. It's insanity, but it's up there. Okay, it's at the,

29
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,290
it's at all time highs. And so I have a friend who, you know,

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,830
trades professionally in the VIX and SPX space. And I met, I said to him,

31
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,180
I said, hey, like, what's going on here? You know, this, I'm like,

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:24,340
this is extremely odd for me to see that the volatility of VXX is so high.

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,260
And we're gonna talk about that in a second. And he said, since the crash,

34
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:39,830
buying vol on VXX has been one of the most popular ways to get long volatility exposure.

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,220
Okay, so buying buying call options on VXX to get, let's say,

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,360
tail risk exposure.

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,480
And just so you guys know,

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,200
what we're looking at here is the one year volatility of VXX.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,780
And VXX is volatility. So you call this the vol of vol. Okay, vol of vol.

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,570
I said, okay, well, you know, I wonder what the S&P vol looks like, right?

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,830
You know, there's really two ways that are popular to hedge. One, buy SPX puts.

42
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, two, buy VIX calls.

43
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,580
So I plotted the S&P, one year vol.

44
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,190
And you guys can see it's been trickling down. Right, which makes sense. Well,

45
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,370
you know, we're seeing the absolute opposite for VXX. Super weird.

46
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,630
So what I'm just going to do here is I'm going to plot the three month vol and the

47
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,110
one year vol in the same graph. Okay, so here's the three month. Here is VXX,

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,580
implied volatility. And for three months.

49
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,060
And here is SPX three month right here. So I asked my friend, I said, hey,

50
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,960
like, how should I structure this trade? Like, you know, I'm trying to,

51
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,880
you know, do you see anything, you know, going on here? And he said,

52
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,990
it's clear as day that VXX is actually the alpha leg. Meaning,

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,020
we want to get short vol on VXX.

54
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,740
But it's kind of hard being short vol outright. You know, things go sour.

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,340
You could be in big trouble. VXX can be explosive. So what he said he would do,

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,310
so he's taking the trade, is buy SPY vol as the hedge. Okay,

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,550
so now we're not just looking at VXX in isolation.

58
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,350
We need to look at VXX vol with S&P vol.

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,000
And one thing to note here, guys, is it's hard to view these graphs like this,

60
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,320
right? We don't even know if these are correlated. Like, it's hard to say, hey,

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,180
well, you know, our next step would be, let me write it down here.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:06,300
Our next step would be, is SPX vol correlated with VXX vol,

63
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,880
right? At the end of the day, we're trading vol versus vol.

64
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,460
If these things aren't correlated, we could be in big trouble.

65
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,610
And it's hard for us to see if they are correlated from this graph. Okay,

66
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,860
so what we need to do is we need to scale the data. Okay, so basically,

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,660
we got to turn everything into standard deviations.

68
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,210
So that's what I'm just doing right here. I'm just scaling the data.

69
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,210
So now we can actually look at this and look how clean this is now. We can say,

70
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:45,010
okay, well, clearly, these two assets are very similar or correlated, right?

71
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,270
Would anyone disagree with that?

72
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,340
Would anyone disagree and say the volatility is not – vol of vol is not correlated

73
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,640
with vol of S&P? What do you guys think?

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,140
So I think we can all say, you know, it is, right?

75
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,170
And so now we say, okay, well, we know – it looks like VXX is overpriced. Okay,

76
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,810
that's our alpha like. And it looks like S&P is fairly priced.

77
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,980
So we can buy S&P against our VXX position and trade this. Now,

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,120
the last thing we need to do – well, not the last thing,

79
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,700
but an important step is to say, okay, well,

80
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:34,470
where is this relationship today relative to where it usually is? Okay?

81
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,260
And not just that, we want to see, okay, well,

82
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,460
where is the relationship of the 1-year vol, the 90-day vol,

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,620
and the realized vols? Okay? So because we need to decide, like,

84
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,640
are we going to trade the 1-year relationship?

85
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,760
Are we going to trade the 10-day relationship, the 90-day relationship?

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,200
What are we going to trade here?

87
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,220
And so that's what this last graph is going to do here.

88
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:16,460
So in green, lime green here, okay, this is the realized vol relationship.

89
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,620
So what is the realized vol of S&P? What is the realized vol of VXX?

90
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,700
Divide those by each other, and that's this green line. Okay?

91
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,080
And you can see that – well, like, that's what it is, okay?

92
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,400
We're going to get back to what we see.

93
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,640
The second thing is this red line here is the implied vol 90 days.

94
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,720
So IV 90-day of the S&P 500 divided by the 90-day vol of VXX.

95
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,900
That's this red graph here. And the blue graph is the 1-year.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,540
So the 1-year of S&P 500 divided by the 1-year of VXX.

97
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,910
And so what we notice is the relationships are at the highs. Okay?

98
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,550
So Vega looks overpriced. Okay? Vega on VXX versus XPX looks overpriced.

99
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:15,170
What we also notice is that the realized ratio is much lower as well.

100
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,190
And not only much lower, it doesn't get much higher.

101
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,460
So what does this mean for us? Well, it means a couple things.

102
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,470
The first thing is vol is overpriced. Vega is overpriced.

103
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,450
And the second thing is it's going to have a positive carry,

104
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,420
meaning theta is overpriced as well. Okay? So when we put on this position,

105
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,560
it's going to carry theta. It's going to make money every single day. Right?

106
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,320
Should make money every single day.

107
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,140
And the second thing is we actually might get the vols to drop.

108
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,680
We might get Vega gains and theta gains. Very rare. That's a very rare, like,

109
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,250
trade to find. But it looks like this is actually going to have both. Right?

110
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,870
Which is awesome.

111
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,160
So before we go and actually structure this position, I have it on thinkorswim.

112
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
Does anyone have any questions about this?

113
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,960
Any questions? Any questions, guys? Like,

114
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,460
usually what we'll see is we'll put on, let's say, you know,

115
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,520
realized vol is going to be through the roof.

116
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,000
And so implied vol is going to be through the roof. But when you sell vol,

117
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,480
usually the realized outpace is the theta. Right?

118
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,510
The gamma outpace is the theta. But in this situation,

119
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,870
we actually might get both.

120
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,460
Let's go structure it out,

121
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,780
and we'll come back with any questions here because I'm not seeing any yet.

122
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,600
Okay, great. So let's go and.

123
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,080
Okay. So here we go.

124
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,410
So here is a paper trade of it just so you guys can see it.

125
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,420
So the way we're structuring this trade is going to be theta neutral.

126
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,000
And we're going to be doing the S&P 500 volatility versus the vol of vol.

127
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,780
And we're going to be doing them a strangle swap. Okay?

128
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,180
We're going to do one strangle versus another strangle.

129
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
And so this is what it looks like.

130
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,240
So here's our S&P. First thing to note, guys, we're going to notice about this.

131
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,100
So I put this on earlier today just to show you guys in this example.

132
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,440
You see how this is up $1,600. This is down $2,000. That's the whole idea,

133
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:42,720
right?

134
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,160
One gain is going to offset the loss or the gain is going to offset the loss.

135
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,180
And in the long run, we're going to make more money on the winning side.

136
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,000
Then we lose.

137
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,760
Okay. So here is the S&P. And the way we structured it is we're long.

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,140
So we're in September. We decide to do the 90-day vol. We just graph it.

139
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,590
We pull up the graph again. We're trading this red line here. Okay?

140
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,690
Because the red line is going to give us a little bit of exposure to realized vol.

141
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,180
And it's at the highs. Okay? The one-year vol has come in quite a bit.

142
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,460
Still high, but has come in quite a bit.

143
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,210
So the structure we did here is a delta 25 strangle. Okay? On the S&P 500.

144
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:34,010
So I bought 100 of the 380s and bought 100 of the 442 to give us a total theta of

145
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,810
$1,000. So every single day, this position is going to lose $1,000.

146
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,590
On the flip side, we did this VXX trade. Okay?

147
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:52,440
And we did it again with a little bit more theta because it's the alpha leg.

148
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,500
So we got 1,150 theta. Okay?

149
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,900
So theta neutral plus a little bit more theta because this is the alpha leg.

150
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,200
And then again, delta 25 strangle. And this is what the trade looks like.

151
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,520
We're short the 31 put and short the 80 call. So that's the trade.

152
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,570
And hopefully, you know, in two, three weeks,

153
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,890
this thing makes a bunch of money.

154
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,740
So now do we have any questions?

155
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,480
Any comments?

156
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,890
Will do, Ram. Just waiting for Jordan here.

157
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,910
Good? Okay. Ram's asking, can you explain what an alpha leg is?

158
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,510
I was going to make a silly joke there. But anyways, Ram,

159
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,770
the alpha leg is you have two things here, right? Now,

160
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,280
one of them is likely to be the over... Okay,

161
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,600
one of them is likely to be efficient.

162
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,260
And the other is likely to be over or underpriced.

163
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,660
The over or underpriced leg is the alpha leg.

164
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,700
This is the leg otherwise known as the error correcting leg.

165
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:21,200
This is the leg that you think should correct. Not this one. Okay? So usually,

166
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,120
there's two things. You usually want to get this leg on first.

167
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,970
And you usually want to trade a little more size. So in this case, Ram,

168
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,460
imagine we have two things here. Okay? They're trading differently. Now,

169
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,340
we think one of two things are going to happen.

170
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,060
This is going to come down or this is going to go up.

171
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,860
Or maybe they meet in the middle. But in this case,

172
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,480
we think that this leg right here is the alpha leg.

173
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,610
So what that means is we think this is going to correct.

174
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,080
So we want to get short a little bit more of this. Right?

175
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,420
Imagine Coca-Cola and Pepsi usually move like this together. Right?

176
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,090
They usually move like this. And then all of a sudden, Pepsi goes like this.

177
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,690
Okay? Now, Pepsi jumped up a bunch in terms of vol. Coca-Cola didn't change.

178
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,430
All right? Well, the question we need to ask is like, okay,

179
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,610
like assuming these should get more correlated or, you know,

180
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,750
come back together in some way.

181
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,490
Is Pepsi supposed to come down or is Coca-Cola supposed to go up?

182
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,870
If we determine that Coca-Cola is the one that's supposed to go up,

183
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,430
this would be the leg that we actually make money on.

184
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,830
And this would be the one that we have as a hedge.

185
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,930
Right? But this is the one that makes the money by coming up.

186
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,700
Perfect. So we've got another question from Adam here. Adam's saying,

187
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,360
so when you say collect Theta and Vega,

188
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,180
do you mean the extra 150 a day that you're getting on the short options?

189
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:05,430
Yeah.

190
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,800
Yeah. Like Adam. So that 150 is the Theta, the positive carry. Right?

191
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,460
So that's like the Theta gains that we would gain from putting this on.

192
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,790
The Vega gains would come from the position correcting, the vols coming down.

193
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,740
So it's like, while we wait for the vols to come down,

194
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
we actually don't have to burn money holding the position.

195
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,000
We'll actually make money holding the position.

196
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,220
So we kind of get to double dip in a way. So, Jordan,

197
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,680
maybe this is an important question to ask. I'm surprised it didn't come up,

198
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,810
honestly. How do we lose money here? Yeah. Good question.

199
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,790
So we lose money here if implied vol, if the spread continues.

200
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,970
Because remember, guys, we're trading this. I'm sharing my screen still, right?

201
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,910
Yes. Okay. So we lose money a couple of ways here.

202
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,460
Way number one, this red line here continues to go up.

203
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,360
We're short this red line right now. Okay. We're short this red line.

204
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,040
Why do we lose money?

205
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,910
This red line goes up and that means we're losing on Vega. Okay.

206
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,850
Implied vols are still moving.

207
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,920
The other way we lose is this green line shoots up.

208
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,510
We're also short this green line. Okay.

209
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,470
We're saying that we're not technically short this green line.

210
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,570
We're just saying that this red line is going to be higher than this green line.

211
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,510
So if this red line goes down and this green line goes down, you know,

212
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,370
we're going to be okay.

213
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,330
So that's another way we could lose money is if this green line just shoots through

214
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:50,470
the roof. AKA let's say S&P doesn't move. Okay. And VXX moves like crazy.

215
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,580
You got another question here.

216
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,860
How do you know how to size these two positions relative to each other? Yep.

217
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,600
You can. So in this case, Theta neutral.

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,980
So Theta neutral just means premium neutral. So think about it like this.

219
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,250
So there's two things, right? There's Vega neutral, which is notional neutral.

220
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,570
So you buy $1 million of the underlying of SPX and,

221
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,470
or SPY and a million dollars of VXX. Theta neutral means.

222
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,290
Imagine nothing happened. Okay. So this, this strangle. Nothing happens.

223
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,410
We realize the max loss on both of these. Okay.

224
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,760
It just means we wouldn't lose or make any money. They're premium neutral. See,

225
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,800
so for example, and this is. $138,000 is how much premium we have to output.

226
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,840
And this is going to be, it should be a tiny bit more. Or 138,000.

227
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,220
So they're both 138,000. They're premium neutral, AKA. Theta neutral.

228
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,320
And that's, you know, whether you want to do Vega neutral or Theta neutral,

229
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,800
that's for another conversation.

230
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,020
So we've got a question here. I'm going to jump in front of this one though.

231
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,400
How are you going to manage this position or is there any management required?

232
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,610
Well, I thought you were going to jump in front of it. No, no.

233
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,650
That's the one that I mentioned. I shared my question. That is my question. Oh,

234
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:33,480
okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Got it. How do I manage this position?

235
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,760
So this is a really good question. And as this thing changes.

236
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,900
So for example let's say we,

237
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,270
let's say implied volatility of VXX starts to collapse.

238
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,330
Then I'm obviously going to close out the position. If let's say the stock,

239
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,590
the S&P jumps up and VXX doesn't move. Well, I got to hedge my deltas. Right.

240
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,450
So it's really going to be,

241
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,790
there's going to be a lot of different combos that could happen,

242
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,190
but I'm really only caring. I really only care about two things. Okay.

243
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,080
Two things I care about. Delta and theta. If one of my legs get too high theta,

244
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,560
I'm going to neutralize it. If one of my legs get too high delta,

245
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm going to neutralize it. And I'm always thinking about it.

246
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:27,540
I'm always thinking about this trade together, together as a whole. Okay. Yeah.

247
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,520
So I was actually about to add on there, Jordan. Where can someone look at the,

248
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,780
the whole portfolio?

249
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,030
Obviously you have, like if I just look at this one trade, it's not,

250
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,970
it doesn't look beta neutral. It's just beta neutral.

251
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,950
well how can I see the whole thing together?

252
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,270
Like what my total theta is on this and my total delta, things like that. Yep.

253
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,110
So your theta, you guys don't need to do any adjusting for it.

254
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,610
It's going to be right here. Delta is going to be a little trickier. Okay.

255
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,730
Delta is going to be a lot trickier. Because S S and P 500.

256
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,210
One delta of S and P 500 is different than one delta of the XX.

257
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
And maybe we can have another live on that,

258
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,540
but that's that's going to be a little bit trickier. Theta. You just.

259
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,640
It's just premium. Right. So you can just look at it right here.

260
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,200
So now for a serious question, You know, we always say, you know,

261
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,460
don't try to repair a losing trade. When are you,

262
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,540
when would you actually exit this thing for a loss? Yeah,

263
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,240
that's a really good question. And with this trade, it's actually really hard.

264
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,950
It's really hard to exit this trade, but you still have to, you know,

265
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,490
you still have to exit. So let me go back to our,

266
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,080
well, it's something to the top like this. Okay. And you look over,

267
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,550
let's say five years data. And it's at the top. It's hard.

268
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,930
As this thing keeps going against you, it's hard to say I'm wrong. Okay.

269
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,590
Especially with a relative value trade like this,

270
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,320
that has such a tight relationship. In this case, you have,

271
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,600
you want to have a PNL stop. So if I lose X amount of dollars,

272
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,950
I have to close the position. Okay.

273
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,490
Remember being wrong and having the right time are the same or having the wrong

274
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,250
time or the same thing. So have a PNL stop. And when you hit that,

275
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,370
you got to exit the position.

276
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,480
So we have another question here from Lucas, Lucas, what's going on, man.

277
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,060
He said, I'm not sure if he covered this yet,

278
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,540
but VXX appears to be made up 50%.

279
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,820
Front month contracts for VIX and 50% June contracts.

280
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,680
And then something he's pointing out about this is that the June contracts have

281
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,240
a lower implied vol than the may contracts. And what do we think about that?

282
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,570
So I think probably right now it's probably 50, 50, but it's, it's,

283
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,970
they're trying to find out what the 30 day volatility, the 30 day vol is.

284
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,390
Right. So let's say for example, so June right now is 44 days, I believe away.

285
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,250
And may is 18.

286
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,630
As we get closer and closer as June gets closer and closer to that 30 day mark.

287
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,310
Then VXX is going to start buying more and more of June contracts.

288
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,520
And in terms of June, having a lower implied vol,

289
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,310
that just means there's going to be a rollup. Right. So you can actually, if,

290
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,250
if, if, if, if the market's in steep contango,

291
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,760
Then VXX should start to trend down. Because of that roll down.

292
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,280
If it's in backwardation. Then as a,

293
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,220
as June gets closer and closer to the 30 day, right. Well,

294
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,450
think about VXX as a, as the ETF is selling high and buying low. Right.

295
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,360
So it's going to have a roll up. And. So how,

296
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,710
how does that affect this position? I thought about it and, you know, that,

297
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,580
that, that, that, that effect from the term structure.

298
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,180
It's not actually going to be as important here just because our position is so

299
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,850
wide. Right. If you look at our position here,

300
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,680
if you look at our position here. We get a 10% move in the underlying.

301
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,200
It doesn't really affect our position because we're a hundred days out.

302
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,860
So we're not really,

303
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,080
we're not really too concerned about those Delta moves for now.

304
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,160
We're more concerned about just the level of vol.

305
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,910
And. I keep in mind, this is also vol of vol. This is not.

306
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,930
This is not volatility. Right. The VXX is the vol.

307
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,000
And this is the volatility of that volatility. So it's called vol, vol, vol.

308
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,680
Any other questions? Yeah. I hope to answer your question.

309
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:01,740
Danveer. What's up, man? Good to see you here. I just noticed.

310
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,870
We have another Sean in the chat. Oh,

311
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,650
And I was like,

312
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,630
I thought it was maybe Jekka or someone playing a joke on me at first.

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,790
But then I remembered. We actually have another Sean. Is he Irish? Hello, Sean.

314
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,270
I spelt the Irish way. So probably. What's up, dude.

315
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,680
An imposter. Right. There can only be one.

316
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,970
So I guess I'll leave.

317
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,140
Cool. So if we have no more questions, I'm going to stop the recording there.
