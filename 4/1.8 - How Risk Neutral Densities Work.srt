1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,760
Okay. Okay, guys. So in this, in today's live,

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,520
we're gonna be talking about risk-neutral densities. Basically,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,280
what does the market think is gonna happen in the future?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,960
What is the market telling us about the future? Right? Remember,

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,000
a trade only happens when we disagree with the market.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,220
If we agree with the market, there's no trade because it's already priced in,

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,060
right? It's like this. If we think Apple is gonna go up,

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,310
and everyone thinks Apple is gonna go up, well,

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,990
it's probably already priced in, right?

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,010
So Apple's already fairly pricing the future return.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,000
If I'm selling this phone for $100, and you think it's only worth $100,

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,680
and you want to resell it, what's the point in buying it, right?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,040
Where's the money to be made? You're gonna buy it from me for $100,

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,460
and go sell it for $100? There's no money there.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,980
Trade happens when I'm selling this phone for $100,

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,120
and you think it's worth $200, and you, well, this is a Samsung S9,

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,760
so it's only worth $50. So buying it would actually be a mistake,

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,440
no matter what I was charging you for it. But you get the point, right?

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,230
You need to disagree on the value of something in order for there to be a trade.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,530
And when it comes to the option space, the cool thing about the options is,

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,430
the options are future forecasting tools, right?

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,920
More so even than the stock price. So we can look at the option chain.

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,000
We can extract some information out of it and be like,

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,640
what is the market telling us that these options,

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,160
and what are these options telling us that the market is saying is going to happen

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,660
in the future, right? Remember, depending on who's buying what,

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,800
what people are willing to pay for different things across the option chain,

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,900
and through time,

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,400
we're able to extract or create a prediction of what the market is saying is gonna

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,560
happen in the future. And then we can compare that to what we think,

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,710
and maybe find a trade. And then on top of that, when we are trading, remember,

32
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,780
guys, we're never trading with certainty, okay?

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,440
That's the most important thing. You know, when someone says,

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,840
buy this because it's going up tomorrow, that's wrong. They have no idea,

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,420
right? You are trading a probability-based game. It's like this.

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,660
You think there's a 60% chance that the stock goes up tomorrow.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Or let's say you're really, like, let's say you're a Forex trader,

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,520
and you think there's a 95% chance that the stock goes up tomorrow,

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,620
or that the Forex pair goes up tomorrow. Now, you need to think, okay,

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,480
what does the market think it's gonna go up tomorrow?

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,760
Maybe the market thinks there's only a 50% chance that it goes up tomorrow.

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,000
And so in that case, the asset is gonna be cheap,

43
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,360
and you can buy the pair and make money in the long run. Now, 5% of the time,

44
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,120
you're gonna lose money. That doesn't mean making a bad trade.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
And that's assuming you have a good forecast, right? Remember,

46
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,460
Sean always says this.

47
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,270
A good trade or a winning trade is not always a good trade,

48
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,350
and a losing trade is not always a bad trade.

49
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,970
You're playing a probability-based game.

50
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,250
If you think there's a 75% chance the stock goes up, and it goes down,

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,890
you got unlucky. There's nothing wrong with that.

52
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,530
It doesn't mean the trade was bad. Right. Because if it came up again,

53
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,230
you should take it again. And doing that every time it comes up,

54
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,510
in the long run, you make money, right?

55
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,530
It's like looking at a downtrend in stocks, like in the S&P, and being like,

56
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,290
buying the S&P doesn't make money. Well, no. We know how much it makes.

57
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,530
It makes 8%, right? But you will go through these downswings.

58
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,250
If it only went up until the right, how would it make a lot more than 8%?

59
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,530
Renato, you like the hair. Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,410
And we're going to be talking about Sean. Sean got one, too.

61
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,910
We got a couple of nice, fresh cuts. Okay. So let's jump into it. Okay.

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,250
What we're going to do, we're going to do quite a bit here, guys.

63
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,650
I want you guys to give me— I'm going to share my screen.

64
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,050
I want you guys to tell me, first guy to say it,

65
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,890
a stock that you like that's liquid. Okay?

66
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,010
We're going to start with a liquid stock.

67
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,550
Give me a stock that you like that's liquid. All right. Apple. Apple.

68
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,990
Apple is first. Oh, we don't— Okay. We'll do Apple and MA, Marcos. Okay.

69
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,940
So— Oh. Okay. Here we go.

70
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,450
So let's— So I wrote some code here for you guys. So what we're going to do,

71
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,570
and I'm going to go step-by-step to show you guys, okay?

72
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,790
So don't worry about the code.

73
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,710
The code is just a tool to help us collect the data. Okay?

74
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,440
So what we're going to do is I pulled the option data, okay, for Apple.

75
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,920
So let's take a look. Okay. So here's Apple. Here's the trade date,

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,100
which is today. Here's the expiration date. So this is, you know, October 2nd.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,200
This is October 9 options, October 16. We have the strike.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,020
We have the call volume, open interest. We have the implied volatilities.

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,720
We have the option prices, everything. Okay?

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,940
So now what we're going to do is these options are forward-looking, right?

81
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,980
When you buy an option,

82
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,360
that person who's selling it to you has some view of the future.

83
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,240
Let's say it's a 30-day option. They have some view of the future.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
So what we can do is we can actually take this option data,

85
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,440
take the implied volatility data,

86
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,140
and graph out what the market thinks is going to happen in the future.

87
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,290
What is the probability that the market thinks the stock is going to follow?

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,300
And guys, we are always trading this. Okay?

89
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,200
So even though if you don't know it, we're going to talk about it right now.

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,300
We're always trading it.

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
So let's look at the – which expiration do you guys want to look at?

92
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,420
Give me the expiration. I have the October 16 here,

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,020
but give me the expiration you guys want to look at.

94
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,430
Where's the chat? Chat, chat, chat, chat. There it is. Got it.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,280
What do you guys want to look at? What's the expo? October 16, November 2nd.

96
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,720
What do you guys want to look at? Okay. Renato is saying October 16. Okay.

97
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:12,290
So what I did was I just took all the options for Apple from October 16. Okay?

98
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,830
Now, I created this model. Okay? That basically – it's called a dual gamma.

99
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,330
It basically tries to price out the – it takes the option data,

100
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,910
the implied volatility data, and turns it into a probability.

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,080
Probability density. So let's graph it out.

102
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:44,780
Okay. So here we have all the strikes. Okay? We have all the strikes here.

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,260
And here is what the market thinks is the probability of Apple going to those strikes.

104
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,440
Okay? So on the y-axis, we have the probability. On the x-axis,

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,740
we have the strikes. Okay? So here's an example.

106
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:13,510
The probability that Apple goes to $50 in two weeks is basically zero.

107
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,160
Make this a little bigger. Okay?

108
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,640
The probability that Apple goes to – and so each dot here, guys,

109
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,140
is an option contract. Each single dot is an option contract.

110
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,940
So the probability that Apple goes to 50 is almost zero.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Did you explain the y-axis? Yeah. It's the probability. Okay.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,020
So this is what the market thinks is going in the future.

113
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,370
So if I actually graph out Apple's current price, okay?

114
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,610
So this is where Apple's current price is. So we can look at this,

115
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,720
and it really looks like the market is saying it's normally distributed.

116
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,460
It's random. It's going to be random going forward. They don't know.

117
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,500
They don't know if it's likely to go up, if it's likely to go down,

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
where the volatility is going to be. They're not too sure.

119
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,350
And it's slightly flatter to the upside. Ever so slightly. Over here? Yeah.

120
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,570
What do you mean flatter? Like it stays higher for longer. Yeah, yeah. So,

121
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,930
okay. So that's actually a really good point.

122
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,730
So this one doesn't really show it that well.

123
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,970
We're going to look at some other examples.

124
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,640
But we can see that there's actually a higher chance that the stock rallies.

125
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,780
Very slightly. Okay, very slightly that the stock rallies a lot, right?

126
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,220
So it's trading at 113. This is like 130. Okay, so there's a little bit of...

127
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,420
This is basically a call skew. And we're going to look into this.

128
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,980
They're implying like an 8% chance of it going to 130. And like, you know,

129
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,260
like a 6% chance of it going to 70.

130
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,320
So let's take a look at something like...

131
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,280
Let's take a look at something that has a lot of risk. Let's take a look at...

132
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,580
Here, you know what? Let's go to the terminal for a second.

133
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,830
It's so funny how you still use my login for the terminal.

134
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,770
Okay, so let's look at something that has a lot of skew. Okay,

135
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,580
so a lot of call skew. Sorry, a lot of call skew. Okay,

136
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,960
let's get this thing pretty liquid.

137
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,830
And we'll get price above 40. Okay, so this thing, Datadog.

138
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,990
No idea what that is. Kyle was chatting to me about this. Okay, so this thing,

139
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,090
if we look here, if we look at Datadog,

140
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,700
okay? If we look at Datadog, there's call skew. You guys see that, right?

141
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,520
There's call skew here on Datadog. So let's take a look at it.

142
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,940
So we're going to take a look at Datadog here.

143
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,460
Should be good. All you change is the ticker, right?

144
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,260
Okay, here we go. Check this out, guys. Okay, so if I plot the...

145
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,480
Okay, so you guys can see here that there's actually,

146
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,800
there's a higher chance of a huge up move. You can see how fat,

147
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,860
like there's not a lot of options for this one,

148
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,730
but you can slightly see how fat this is over here. Okay,

149
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:20,020
and then you can also see that these options right here at around $85 are a bit

150
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,700
overpriced, right? This line should follow down like this and come in,

151
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,640
but there's a little bit of clustering here. So these 85, 83,

152
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,320
82 options over here, these are slightly overpriced, right? Relative to,

153
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,140
let's say, this one right here. Okay,

154
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,820
so a market maker might come in and he would sell these and buy these options.

155
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,760
And buy around it, sell the overpriced individual contract.

156
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,200
But as a positional trader,

157
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,940
we're more interested in where is the overpriced option in general?

158
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,620
So what else can we do here? Well,

159
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,900
what we can do is we can actually graph the historical returns of Datadog.

160
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,350
Okay, we can graph the historical returns of Datadog. Now,

161
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,170
let's take a look here.

162
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,320
What do we notice about the actual realized distribution? This is Datadog.

163
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,680
What we realize is there's actually a fatter left tail. Okay,

164
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,200
meaning that the risk is usually to the downside.

165
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,400
The down moves are usually more frequent.

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,020
The big down moves are usually more frequent, okay, than the big up moves.

167
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,910
Okay, let me show you guys. Let me plot a line here. Let me plot a graph here.

168
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:50,100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a line at negative 0.04. Okay,

169
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,820
and a line at 0.04. So 4% up versus 4% down.

170
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,150
Okay, and what we actually see here, guys,

171
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,430
is actually we're going to go not even that high up.

172
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,090
We're going to go right here.

173
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,570
Okay, so what we notice here, guys, is remember, y-axis is the frequency. Okay,

174
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,190
so there are usually larger down moves, right? You can see right here.

175
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,700
There are usually larger down moves than there are large up moves.

176
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,540
So what does this mean?

177
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,570
This means that there should be put skew rather than call skew.

178
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,420
But when we look at the data,

179
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,200
when we look at what the options market is implying, okay,

180
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,230
we can see that there's actually call skew, right?

181
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,670
The market's thinking that there's a higher chance the stock blows to the upside.

182
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,010
But when we look at historical realized distributions, we say, well,

183
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,290
guess what? No, it doesn't. Now,

184
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,230
this doesn't mean that there's not some fundamental reason that's happening right

185
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,570
now. For example, when Walmart was getting bid up for TikTok,

186
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,290
we should have a little bit of volatility to the upside, right?

187
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,480
But sometimes the market gets so unreasonable. Okay,

188
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,940
we're going to look at one more, SPY.

189
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,000
And then we're going to look at how you can price this without graphing this risk

190
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,620
neutral density.

191
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,200
Look at this, guys, okay? We have a fat tail. We have a very, very fat tail.

192
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,030
See that? Let me put a line right here for you guys to see it. So AB line,

193
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,660
let's do... So spot price right now, I believe.

194
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,480
I believe the current spot price is...

195
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:00,170
So S&P is currently trading at or was currently when this data was pulled is $334.

196
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:12,780
So if we go, for example, let's say we're going to go 10% down. So actually,

197
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,100
we're not going to go that far down. We're going to go, let's say, 5%, 4% down,

198
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,950
okay? And we're going to go 4% up.

199
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,540
Okay,

200
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,760
let's actually go a little bit more.

201
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,640
Here we go, boom. Okay, look at this, guys, okay?

202
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,350
So you guys can see right here. So here is a 8% move up.

203
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,510
The market's saying that there's an 8% chance of this happening over the next two

204
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,050
weeks, 8% chance, okay?

205
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:15,970
But an 8% down move actually has more of a 15% chance happening, okay?

206
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,330
That's what the options market's implying. It's saying, well,

207
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,870
there's actually a bigger chance that a large move down happens.

208
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,670
And there's a smaller chance that a large up move happens.

209
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,120
Steven, this is implied,

210
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,690
okay? And then what we can do is we can also graph it. Like,

211
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,770
does this make sense? Well, let's take a look,

212
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,430
okay? Well, absolutely, this makes sense. Absolutely, right?

213
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,680
You see some right around here. So if I did, let's say, we're going to say,

214
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,540
let's say, a 3% down move, 3% up move. Okay, let's do this.

215
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,460
Actually, let's do a little less. So this is on the daily timeframe, guys.

216
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,470
These are the daily terms, okay? There is,

217
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,310
it's more likely that we have a down move than we do have an up move or large up

218
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:33,610
move, okay? Not a, it's not a small up move. It's a large up move, okay,

219
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,750
versus a large down move. The chances are a lot higher. Now,

220
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,410
what we notice though,

221
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,410
what we're seeing in the implied versus the realized is that the difference was

222
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,560
huge, right?

223
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,140
And that's why they say selling out of the money puts is a long-term profitable

224
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,100
strategy because it usually implies more than what actually happens, right?

225
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,180
The implied skew is usually overpriced, right?

226
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,340
There's a lot of research on this.

227
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,820
And this is where you guys see it in firsthand, okay?

228
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,800
So how can, without having the risk-neutral densities in front of us, okay,

229
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,880
how can we make a decision? How can we say, well, what's the market implying?

230
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,040
Well, it's very simple. And we're going to go thinkorswim,

231
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,540
and we're going to price it out right now.

232
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,820
So you guys can see what is the market implying an up move versus a down move.

233
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,970
And just to be clear, guys, whenever you make a trade,

234
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,840
you always have a view on the distribution of the future, right? As soon as,

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,200
if you don't know for certainty, think about this, guys.

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,990
If you don't know for certainty, you have a distribution, you have odds,

237
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,810
you have probabilities. When you take a trade,

238
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,410
if you don't know for certain that this stock is going to go up,

239
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,100
you have a distribution of possible outcomes.

240
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,660
It is likely that the stock goes up, let's say 3%.

241
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,980
It's less likely it goes up 10%,

242
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,520
and it's not likely that it goes down 2% or 3%,

243
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,240
whatever your odds are when you're making your bet. That's your implied odds,

244
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,280
right? Whenever you make a trade,

245
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,660
you're actually calculating that in your head, whether you know it or not.

246
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,080
And if we graphed out all your thoughts and opinions about the stock,

247
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,760
it would look something like this,

248
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,400
okay? And this is what the options market is showing you here,

249
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,070
okay?

250
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,900
So let's see what's going on here.

251
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:03,210
So we said SPY had a lot of put skew, okay? We said SPY had a lot of put skew.

252
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:10,120
So what does that mean? So the market is saying that there is a chance,

253
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,820
the down move is a lot larger than an up move.

254
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
That's what the market is saying, okay?

255
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,040
So the down move is a lot larger than an up move. So what do you guys think?

256
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,620
Is the market saying that S&P is going to go down or the S&P is going to go up?

257
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,560
What is the most likely scenario for tomorrow?

258
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,230
Stephen's saying up slightly, okay? Does anyone disagree with Stephen?

259
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
Ains is saying down.

260
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,030
Okay, Stephen's right here, okay? Because think about it like this, Ains.

261
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,720
You're in a basketball. You are betting on a basketball game, okay?

262
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,060
And it's going to, like, actually, Ains,

263
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,560
what sport is like your favorite sport?

264
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,700
Because then it's more relatable and then maybe it will help you understand.

265
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,290
What's your favorite sport to play?

266
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,140
NFL, okay. So, fuck, I don't know any NFL. Okay,

267
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,820
so who's like the worst team and the best team?

268
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:31,470
Okay, Packers is worst team or best team? Okay, Packers best, Jets worst. Ains,

269
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,210
okay, Ains is saying Tampa's best. Okay, so we're going to mix it up.

270
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,500
We're going to say it's Tampa versus the Jets in Tampa, okay?

271
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,540
Tampa's playing the Jets in Tampa.

272
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,750
What do you think the probabilities of Tampa winning is?

273
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,840
90%, exactly, right? It's going to be huge. They should win eyes closed.

274
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,430
So what are the odds going to be on betting on the Jets, right?

275
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,690
You should be getting a huge payout if you bet on the Jets and they win,

276
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,510
but you're not going to get a big payout if you bet on Tampa and they win,

277
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,580
right? So that's what's happening here.

278
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:26,320
If the market is saying there's a chance of a huge down move, okay?

279
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,280
So the chance of a huge down move, aka the Jets winning, okay,

280
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,540
then you are going to get paid out big, right?

281
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,220
But it's most likely that Tampa is going to win. So if you buy the S&P, right,

282
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,220
you are most likely going to get a little bit of an up move tomorrow, right?

283
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,180
You might get a percent tomorrow,

284
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,260
but less likely you're going to have a huge down move.

285
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,710
It has to compensate for that, right? Imagine if it was like this, guys.

286
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,130
Imagine if it was more likely that the stock went down and it was more likely that

287
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,590
if it did go down, it would go down like crazy.

288
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,630
That would be like saying if the Jets win, or sorry,

289
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,310
that would be like saying if Tampa wins, you get paid out three to one.

290
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,140
That doesn't make sense, right? So the way we look at it is,

291
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,090
the way the market looks at it is, it has to be a fair bet, right?

292
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,270
If I'm going to buy equities, let's say there's two scenarios tomorrow. Okay,

293
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,210
I'm going to buy this stock.

294
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:36,800
It's either going to go up very little or it's going to go down a lot. Well,

295
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,880
in order for this to be a fair bet, the up move has to be more likely.

296
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,210
Does that make sense? In order for me to bet on Tampa, it has to be a fair bet.

297
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,250
And that also means that I'm going to get paid out less because it's more likely

298
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,210
that Tampa wins.

299
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,600
Okay, so if we see big put skew, meaning the risk from last night,

300
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,240
from last week's live or this week's live, the risk is to the downside,

301
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,740
meaning the big move is to the downside,

302
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,010
then most likely the stock needs to go up. Okay,

303
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,110
so we're going to look at that right now.

304
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,310
We are going to look at a 14-day option.

305
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,860
Okay, and how we're going to do this, so I'm going to go on SPY here.

306
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,190
Okay, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to price a vertical spread.

307
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,720
So S&P is trading at 334. Okay, that was the last close, 334. Okay,

308
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,940
so what we're going to do is,

309
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,480
we're going to go to the 334 strike and we're going to buy a 10-wide vertical spread.

310
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,460
So we're going to go 5 down to 329 and we're going to go 5 up to 339.

311
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,960
Okay, so far so good. We're going, the spot price was 334.

312
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,010
We're going 5 down and we're going 5 up. Okay,

313
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,880
so now we have a call spread 329, 339. So let's take a look here.

314
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:26,380
Okay, so here it is. Okay, so here is our bet. Now,

315
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,150
what do you guys notice here? So here's where the current stock price is.

316
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,160
Okay, let me just turn this into,

317
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,400
just make this a lot easier for you guys to see.

318
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,400
Okay, see this line here? This line is where the current stock price is.

319
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,810
What do you guys notice about this bet? Okay,

320
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,430
pretend this bet is the Tampa Bay versus the Jets. If I said this is our,

321
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,250
who are we betting on here, guys? If you had this payout right now,

322
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,970
if this was your payout, who would you be, who would we bet,

323
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,850
who would we be betting on here?

324
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,150
Okay, and this is, yeah. Who would we be betting on if this was the win,

325
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,290
if this was the winning side?

326
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,840
Rami said the Bucks. Is that Tampa Bay Bucks? What's the other team? Jets.

327
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,130
I have no idea. Okay, Mark was saying Tampa Bay. Okay, so, exactly. Why?

328
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,390
Why would this, why would this spread here?

329
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,610
Why would this trade be betting on Tampa?

330
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,700
Okay. Tell me more, Ram. Tell me more. You're on the right track. Tell me more.

331
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,000
Why? Why is this here? I'm going to make this actually 575. Why?

332
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,940
Why is it that this trade here is betting on Tampa? How do we know this?

333
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,940
How can we infer that this is betting on Tampa and not the Jets?

334
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,640
What do you guys think? What's going on here? Right?

335
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,660
Okay. Marco's odds are in our favor. What is,

336
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,280
tell me more about the payoff of this thing. Tell me more about the payoff.

337
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,660
The payout. Exactly. What about the payout, Ram? Tell me more.

338
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,530
I need to know more here, bud. It's not, it's actually not one-to-one. So,

339
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:38,230
if we lose, we lose 5,750. If we win, we win 4,250. The payout is less.

340
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,350
Exactly. Right? Because Tampa has a higher chance of winning,

341
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:50,340
we have to get paid out less. We can't get paid out the same. So,

342
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,260
and we're looking at this spread here. Okay.

343
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,140
The market's telling us that the most likely scenario is S&P 500 in the next 16

344
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,520
days to be up. Now, that's great. But what are these odds?

345
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,560
What is the market telling us here? What are the odds we're getting?

346
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,710
The odds we're getting is there's a 57.5% chance. So,

347
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:20,310
all we did was we took our debit and we divided it by the width of the strikes.

348
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,620
Okay. The width of the strikes. And that is 57.5% chance. So,

349
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,120
the market is saying that there is a 57.5% chance that in the next 16 days,

350
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,680
S&P 500 is going to be up.

351
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,790
Now, we have something to work with here, guys. Okay.

352
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,110
Imagine I just told you that. Imagine I told you this, actually.

353
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,020
There's a 75% chance that the market's going to be up. What could you do?

354
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,980
What could you do? Well, first off, you'd have to think to yourself, well,

355
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,190
that doesn't make sense. Right? That's kind of...

356
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,250
The market's telling me there's a 75% chance up. I've never seen that before.

357
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,810
Right? It's usually 55, 57 at best.

358
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,960
Right? So, what we could do is we could sell this spread.

359
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,030
Right? We could sell this spread.

360
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,050
Because this spread is giving us great risk reward. Right?

361
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:28,750
Imagine if it was 75% chance, guys. Okay? It'd be $7.50. Okay?

362
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,870
This is what we would have.

363
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,800
Now, this trade would be an amazing trade. This would be a beautiful trade.

364
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:43,260
Right? It'd be huge. Huge. Huge. Huge trade. When I said beautiful there,

365
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,360
I felt like I sounded like him. It's going to be beautiful. Beautiful.

366
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,550
Beautiful. Okay. So, if you put on this trade, right? Well,

367
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,310
there's a 25% chance. Okay?

368
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,750
Sometimes you can be wrong here is what I'm trying to say here.

369
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,010
Sometimes you can be wrong. And you might say to yourself, Oh,

370
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,900
this was a bad trade. No, this was a great trade. Right?

371
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,530
Because most of the time you're going to be right. Right?

372
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,260
Or this trade has a positive expectancy. Okay? So,

373
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,230
let's go back to our risk-neutral densities. You guys can see that. Right?

374
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,290
We're looking at, I think you guys are going to have a nicer perspective. Now,

375
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,530
when we look at this, Let me actually just take the logs of this. So,

376
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,370
you guys might be able to see it a little bit better.

377
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,540
Okay.

378
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,470
So, you guys see how fat this tail is? Right?

379
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,690
You guys see that fatness in the tail, right?

380
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,990
Okay. What this is saying is, So, the,

381
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:57,980
I'm just going to take a screenshot here. So, we're going to draw on it, guys.

382
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,620
You can use it.

383
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,750
Oh, nice. Okay.

384
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:14,310
Is this good over here? This box? Yeah, it's good. Okay. So,

385
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:19,590
I get a straight line. Okay. So, here is where spot price is going to be. Okay?

386
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
So, what is this telling us? Well,

387
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,320
it's telling us that the most likely scenario, Remember, this is probably,

388
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,460
You still have the, yeah. This is frequency. Okay? This is frequency.

389
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,610
The most likely scenario is this. Is a little tiny up move.

390
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,910
That is the most likely scenario. Now, if this was the most likely scenario,

391
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,090
We would just buy stocks. We would just buy stocks and make money.

392
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,890
Make so much money. Okay? We have a little bit of an edge.

393
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,400
We'd make a ton of money. But that's not right.

394
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,180
We can't just make free money like this. We can't just print money.

395
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:12,500
There has to be a catch. And the catch is, The chance of a huge down move.

396
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:28,440
Okay? Is higher than the chance of a huge up move. So,

397
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,240
we are being compensated for the small probability,

398
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,840
For the higher probability of winning.

399
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,330
Because of a larger probability of a large down move.

400
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,890
And that is called risk neutral. Because we are indifferent.

401
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,730
We are risk neutral. We don't care if we sell or if we buy.

402
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,430
Because it's a fair bet.

403
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,690
Okay? And that is what this is all about.

404
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,790
It's about graphing out what are the options thinking.

405
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,610
What is the option market thinking is the future. Now, we would make money.

406
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,110
If ours was different than this. If we thought the graph should look like this.

407
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:14,830
Okay? We thought it should look like this. A lot of positive call skew.

408
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,560
Something like this.

409
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,760
Sorry guys. Terrible drawing. But imagine our thing looked like this. Okay?

410
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,820
Well, we can make a trade. Because guess what? These options are cheap.

411
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,160
And these options are cheap.

412
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,120
Okay? So, if we don't have access to this.

413
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,300
Which we are all going to have eventually on the terminal.

414
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,800
This is... Oops. Ah, shit.

415
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:06,070
Okay? What we can do instead is price it. Using a call spread. Okay?

416
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,170
We can price it by using a call spread.

417
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,070
And we can actually price them using butterflies as well.

418
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,000
To get the risk neutral density. But call spread is usually enough. Okay?

419
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,840
You're getting the probability of an up move versus a down move.

420
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,020
This explains the skew.

421
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,110
Okay? So, we'll scroll to DDOG. It's the same thing here. So,

422
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,050
what do you guys think we're going to see when we price this call spread?

423
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,820
What do you guys think we're going to see when we price this call spread?

424
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,300
It's not very liquid though, unfortunately.

425
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,910
Okay. So, here we are with this.

426
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:35,950
So, $3.10 for this call spread. For 7 wide call spread. Okay? Quick maths.

427
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,820
3 divided by 7. Or, sorry. Yeah, we'll just call it 3. Oh, no.

428
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,180
I think it was 3. What was it? 3.10.

429
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,780
Okay. So, the market's saying there's only a 44% chance of an up move. Right?

430
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,190
But that also means what the market is saying is the volatility to the upside is

431
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,790
going to be a lot stronger than to the downside. So,

432
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,110
now you guys got to come and say, well, DDOG,

433
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,140
this thing is definitely not going down. And so, this call spread, okay,

434
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,300
is a really good trade.

435
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,800
Right? Because you think this should actually have a… Think about it like this,

436
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,560
guys. Right?

437
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:27,820
The way you can think about it is if you thought there was a 60% chance that the

438
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,870
stock goes up, well, it should be priced at $6. Oh, sorry.

439
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,410
It should be priced at like $3.70.

440
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,960
Right? Or 60%? What would 60% be? I think it's like $3.85.

441
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:47,330
Okay,

442
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,350
so this thing should be priced at $3.85 because you think there's a 60% chance that

443
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,970
it goes up, but it's priced at $3.10.

444
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,020
Cool. Cool. That's it. That's all I really have to show you guys today. So,

445
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,840
let's talk about one more thing here,

446
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,040
which is kind of what Jack is alluding to here. He's like,

447
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,620
so are we assuming it's not going down based on the distribution? No,

448
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,200
we're coming up with our own forecast to compare to it. So,

449
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,540
maybe we can quickly, for a couple of minutes,

450
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,320
talk about how they actually go about formulating their own opinions about these

451
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,480
things more objectively rather than just how they feel. Yeah. So,

452
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,410
one way you can look at it, right, is through the realized distributions.

453
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,350
Right? What actually has happened historically? Okay,

454
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,750
so if we look historically at S&P 500, let's say.

455
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,180
What does it actually look like? So,

456
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:44,060
an easy one to think would be we should never see call skew on the S&P 500 because

457
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,640
it's never shown call skew before.

458
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,060
It doesn't make sense for there to be call skew on the S&P 500.

459
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:53,080
The risk is not to the upside. It's to the downside. That's one way.

460
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,820
In that sense, you're kind of harvesting this risk premium.

461
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:05,750
The other way is situational. Right? So, Walmart was in a bid for TikTok. Okay?

462
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,290
Now, you're not going to be able to get data on this. Right?

463
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:16,500
You were in a situational position where this only happens once ever.

464
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,740
Walmart is never going to be in a situation where they're bidding for TikTok.

465
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,220
Right? This is a one-time thing. So, it's your job as a trader,

466
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,880
if you want to trade this, to be like, well, what are the odds? Well,

467
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,020
first off, if Walmart gets the deal, the stock goes up.

468
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,720
If they don't get the deal, the stock goes down. So, what do you do?

469
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,140
You go in and you see what the market is pricing.

470
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,220
Maybe the market is pricing 50-50. It's unsure. Okay?

471
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,040
So, what you need to do now is say, well,

472
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,720
what are the odds that Walmart gets TikTok? And that's research. Right?

473
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,340
Nothing beats good, old, hardcore research. That's your job as a trader.

474
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:12,270
And that's why you will get paid. Right? Okay? So, that's how you go about it.

475
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,650
You can either, for example,

476
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:20,550
sell vol on the S&P 500 because you can historically see that the skew right now

477
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:27,210
is a lot higher than what it usually is implying. Okay? It's a lot higher. So,

478
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,430
you would say, okay, well, I should be selling vol here. Okay? Now,

479
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,200
that's a risk premium that you're going to be harvesting. Okay?

480
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,380
But then there's a situational factor. DDOG. They just got bought by Microsoft.

481
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,400
People think the stock is still going up and the volatility is to the upside.

482
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,780
It's your job now to be like, what's actually going to happen here?

483
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,060
Let me dig in. Let me look at the research. Let me look at everything I can.

484
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,720
Let me get my hands on as much information as I possibly can.

485
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,310
Then I'm going to make a decision. I'm going to bet reasonably large.

486
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,320
And if I get paid out, it was because I put in the work. That's it.

487
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,180
Marcos, I agree. So, maybe next week we'll talk. Or no,

488
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,740
next week we're going to talk about stats, right? Stats. After next week. So,

489
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,090
two weeks from now, we'll focus heavily on research. Yeah.

490
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Right. You got it, Steve. So, what they were saying,

491
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,460
the most likely scenario is Walmart doesn't get it. But if they do get it,

492
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,560
right? It's going to blow up. It's going to blow up.

493
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,100
Because if everyone's thinking, so, think about this, Steve.

494
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,270
People don't know for certain, right? So,

495
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,670
there's always going to be something priced in. So,

496
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,690
people don't know for certain. And so, if Walmart didn't get the deal,

497
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,070
the stock would come down, which it did. And that was the most likely event.

498
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,710
But if it did go through, it would catch everyone off guard. And so,

499
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,030
the volatility would be to the upside. So,

500
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,350
then it would be your job to be like, well,

501
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,410
what are the odds Walmart actually gets that deal? Right?

502
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,550
Maybe it's actually less than what the market's implying.

503
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,850
Maybe the market was implying, Steve. I think it was like,

504
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,550
it was actually a lot of call skew. It was a ton of call skew. So,

505
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,150
it might have been like, let's say, 45-55.

506
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,200
So, you know, 45% chance Walmart didn't get the deal. But remember,

507
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,640
it also had other things priced in. Like, if the stock market still went up,

508
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,620
it wasn't just the TikTok. Because obviously,

509
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,840
it wasn't going to be a 45% chance that Walmart got TikTok. But you might say,

510
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,820
well, if they actually don't get the deal, then even if the market goes up,

511
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,900
Walmart is still going to go down. Okay? And then you could be like, well,

512
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,120
it's actually like, considering everyone else in the race,

513
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,580
it's only really a 15% chance that Walmart gets the deal. So,

514
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,820
when they announce that it's Oracle that's getting the deal,

515
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,450
what's going to happen to Walmart? Right? And so,

516
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:11,270
you actually would be buying put spreads or you would be shorting the shares.

517
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,090
Okay?

518
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,150
So, that's going to be, that is what we're going to be talking about.

519
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,380
And that's what we're going to wrap it up here. Yeah, Steve,

520
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,120
I know you'd like this, man. It's a little bit more advanced stuff.
