1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,600
Okay, so in this video, guys, we're going to be chatting about, sorry,

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,220
give me one quick sec, let me make sure that,

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:15,930
okay.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,220
All right, so we'll say we're gonna be chatting actually about Queb.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,860
So Steve B. found a really interesting idea that when we looked further into,

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,440
that we think there could be a ton of alpha.

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,130
So I just thought go through the process of how we found it,

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,250
what we think might happen and then why we think it's cheap or expensive.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,260
So I got a message from Steve saying, hey, listen,

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,330
check out the longer dated vols on Queb. Okay,

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,580
so let me share my screen here and we will take a look together.

12
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,900
So can you guys see my screen?

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,640
All right, so Queb, we're gonna plot a couple of vols here.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,680
We're gonna plot September, August, October, November,

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,240
because we traded November, but then we're gonna plot Jan 2023.

16
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,150
So take a look here.

17
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,590
One thing we noticed was if you look at some vols in terms of August,

18
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,650
September, you notice like,

19
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,530
so actually let's just look at August and September right now.

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,040
So the near dated vols. All right, let's take a look at these.

21
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,660
And you notice how initially you had a big spike, then cooled off,

22
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,680
and then it spiked back up to around the same level.

23
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:19,310
So it's almost like gamma is being priced in the same now as it was when the first

24
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,090
big move happened.

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,000
However, when we look, and this is also true for, let's say, November.

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,720
So we're getting a little bit further out,

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,230
but you can still see like November is back at its previous highs. All right,

28
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,750
now let's take a look at Jan 2023.

29
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,270
So what do we notice here about Jan 2023? Well,

30
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,970
it's continued to make, like there's a reach for vega here, right?

31
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,550
There's a reach for these long dated vols where we can see that the long-term vols

32
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,470
are making new highs, right? So what we might've seen,

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,890
if it was similar to everything else,

34
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,050
is we might've seen Jan 2023 around 3940 vol.

35
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,850
But instead we're seeing it at 46 and a half.

36
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,190
And when Steve first mentioned it to me, it was like 47 and a half.

37
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,570
But then of course we started selling and we might've brought the term structure

38
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,130
down or the January down a little bit.

39
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,810
So here we have Jan 2023 trading in line with options that are 90 days out,

40
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,520
60 days out. And so right off the bat,

41
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,640
that kind of tells us that maybe these long dated options are overpriced,

42
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,670
right? Maybe someone's reaching for vega and it's less liquid.

43
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:50,660
So it's likely that vols might be getting too bid out there. So we said, okay,

44
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,540
let's investigate a little more. Let's see what's going on.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,580
And so what we actually started looking at,

46
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,940
what we started noticing or Steve started noticing was look at some of these other

47
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,980
names. Some of the stocks in the holding, that Queb is holding here. You know,

48
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,180
we got Baidu 43 vol, right? For Jan 2023. We got Baba 45 vol.

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,920
We got JD.com 42 vol.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,520
So some of the biggest holdings here are trading well below the 47 vol that we were

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,380
seeing earlier. And so what we actually did was we said, okay, well,

52
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,600
let's create a sheet here.

53
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,450
Let's create a sheet and let's take a look at here.

54
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,630
Let's take a look at all the holdings and let's see what is being implied by the

55
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,890
correlation here. What's the implied correlation here on Queb?

56
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,750
So you can see what we did here. We did like 10 cent holding.

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,950
This is 11% of Queb and it's trading at 34 vol, right?

58
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,600
Alibaba 10% trading at 44 vol. We did it for all the stocks here.

59
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,690
Unfortunately, some of the stocks don't have options, they're not optionable.

60
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,240
So we put no data. The good news was a lot of these didn't have,

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,180
there was only 4% of the assets.

62
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,680
4% of the assets for this ETF that didn't have any data.

63
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,710
Luckily we had Bloomberg.

64
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,180
So we were able to use the volatility surface here to find what, you know,

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:33,600
what vols were trading in Hong Kong. So for example, the Hong Kong 10 cent,

66
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,860
right? We can see that the, you know, the December 2022 is trading at 34 vol,

67
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,360
right? At a hundred percent money in this. So we were able to input that there.

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,880
We go down the list and now we're trying to say, okay, well,

69
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,260
given all this information now, but what's the implied correlation of this ETF,

70
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,170
right? So the closer, you know, of course these,

71
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,600
these stocks are not going to move with correlation of one, right.

72
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,900
That'd be crazy.

73
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,500
And it's likely because the volatilities are a lot higher on these names that the

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,610
correlation is going to be a lot lower. Okay. Maybe 30, maybe 40.

75
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,990
And we're going to have to test that of course.

76
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,290
But the first thing we need to do is, okay, we need to say, well,

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,880
what's the implied correlation. So what we did was we pulled in the data. Okay.

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,040
We pulled in the data here and we said,

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,520
we're going to make, we need. So to calculate implied correlation,

80
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,980
we need three things. We need volatility. Okay. For all the components.

81
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,330
And then we need the weights for all the components. Actually,

82
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,430
let me just pause here and make sure everyone's following here.

83
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,570
Let me check the chat questions so far, guys.

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah. Tico similar to let,

85
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,420
I don't think we did an in-depth analysis on lit and when we should have,

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,200
but this one we're doing a lot more.

87
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,740
All right.

88
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,490
Okay. So here we said, okay, let's get the vols, which we have. Right.

89
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,550
We have the volatilities and we have the weights.

90
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,950
So we're going to get two vectors weights and applied vol.

91
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,950
So let's just take a look at those.

92
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,710
Okay. So these are all the volatilities, right? 10 cent was 34 vol Bob.

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:43,910
I was 44. And then let's get the weights. So here you go. Here we see 11%, 10%.

94
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:51,300
And then we need the implied volatility. Of the ETF. 47.

95
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,400
Now what we're going to do here. Is given all that information,

96
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,180
we can actually calculate. What the implied correlation is.

97
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,620
I'm not going to go into this formula too much.

98
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,520
Maybe one day we can go into it in depth. But for now,

99
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
we're just going to run it. Okay.

100
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,840
And we actually get an implied correlation of 76%. For two year options.

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,280
So this is crazy, right? To give you guys a general idea.

102
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Of some other ETFs or some other indexes.

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,280
What their correlations are looking like. Let's go to.

104
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,610
Not my COVID test today, guys.

105
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,950
I don't know if I might have it not feeling great. A little bit of a fever,

106
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,790
a little bit of a cough.

107
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,740
Let's see. Alrighty. So here we go.

108
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,320
So let's take a look at implied correlations for a couple indexes here.

109
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,980
So here's the implied correlation across all of these indexes.

110
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:19,770
So we have Dow Jones. 41%. Okay. We have S&P 500. 30%. NASDAQ 37%. Russell 21%.

111
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,530
Okay. And just the other day. S&P was at like 23. Dow Jones.

112
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,140
I'm actually surprised to see 41. It's quite high in my opinion.

113
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,770
And then you can see in Europe here, like the Euro stocks, 50 is 39. FTSE.

114
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,730
And these are all the 30 day options. So let's actually go further out.

115
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,910
Let's go to the one year.

116
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,040
So here actually it picks up a bit. Okay. That's for another story,

117
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,290
but usually. Vols are more expensive in the back, right? You get that contango.

118
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,790
So the implied vol.

119
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,430
For the single names are usually not going to be in contango. But the,

120
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,530
the index is. Right. So it looks like there's going to be like more of a,

121
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,110
more of a premium in the back there.

122
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,550
So not, not really surprised to see that.

123
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,170
Let's see if we change this to three months. Yeah. Okay. Anyways.

124
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:23,190
We're seeing like anywhere between 30. And 45. For these indexes.

125
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,350
Hang sang index. So in Asia, we've got 34 and a half. And then in Australia,

126
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:34,380
we're seeing 40. What's this ESTX banks. This one's pretty heavy.

127
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,830
So this let's see what, let's see what's holding.

128
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,610
Let's see what's in this thing.

129
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,520
Okay. So it looks like. Not many stocks. There's only like what?

130
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,180
20 stocks here. 15 stocks.

131
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,350
It seems super concentrated. Right.

132
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,870
And these are probably all very low volatilities. Remember what you said when,

133
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,550
when vols are lower for the individual name, usually.

134
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,130
The implied correlations can be a little bit higher if they're the,

135
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:11,040
if they're the same asset. That being said though, if the index drops, right.

136
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,860
Or everything goes down. The volatilities increase.

137
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,560
And so does the implied correlations.

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:21,680
Okay.

139
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,180
So 30, 35 to 40 to 45, 30 to 45 is what we're seeing. Even 25 to 45.

140
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:40,850
And we're seeing 76. For these Chinese tech stocks. Right.

141
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,460
So we're trading the tech basket. And then we're seeing a 76.

142
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,380
So just like to put that perspective, NASDAQ is 45. Right.

143
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,420
So that's pretty insane. Right. And so the question we should ask is like,

144
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,900
okay, well, what, what do we think implied correlation should be?

145
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,220
And let's say, for example, we think implied correlation should be.

146
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Let's just throw an arbitrary number out there. 45. Okay. 45%. Well,

147
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:19,730
if we change Ivy. So let's say 37. Okay. And we hit this. Well,

148
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,620
now we're getting 45. Implied vol. Now 45 implied correlation. So what,

149
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,820
what that's telling us is if the,

150
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,840
if the basket has an implied correlation of 45%.

151
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:39,820
Then the fair value of balls today is 37. Is 37%.

152
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,160
But right now it's trading at 47.

153
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:53,520
Now that being said though, is, is 45% correlation for value. Right.

154
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,680
And so what we need to do is we need to say, okay, well, let's,

155
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,560
let's plot the realize correlation.

156
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,520
Let's pull up the realize correlation for this ETF over time and see what it,

157
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,920
see what it is. I don't have that right now, guys, unfortunately.

158
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,480
I was working on it, but I didn't have enough time to finish it.

159
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,720
So I'll post it in the group. Next week. But let's just,

160
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,060
let's just quickly take a look here at SMP.

161
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,580
Let's see. We can plot this guys.

162
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,460
There's a function here. I don't recall what it is, but anyways,

163
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,320
three month realized vols for the SMP. Let's take a look at the realized vols.

164
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,760
Okay. The realized correlations. Look at this guys.

165
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,620
Russell index 12 SMP 26. Dow Jones 28. Right. All of a sudden now,

166
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,100
like usually we,

167
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,980
people usually say like ETFs are usually more expensive and that's because you're

168
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,670
getting this like implied correlation risk premium. Right.

169
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,290
So let's go six months.

170
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,610
So now all of a sudden we go from what was a correlation of,

171
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:07,570
let's say 25 to 45. From now let's say 15 to 30. Right.

172
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,810
For the realized correlations.

173
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,540
And so, you know, given all this information,

174
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,380
we could probably say that implied correlation of 76 is like way overdue,

175
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,120
but we need to figure out what it should be. Right.

176
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:30,720
And it's likely going to be something along the lines of 40%. Maybe even 35%.

177
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,440
And so, you know, if we were, let's say a humongous hedge fund, and we wanted,

178
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,860
let's say, let's say less risk.

179
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,320
What we could do is maybe do a dispersion trade where we figure out, okay,

180
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,500
well, what assets shouldn't,

181
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,880
can we buy here to kind of replicate the ETF invest with only,

182
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,140
let's say a handful of stocks.

183
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,700
Maybe we will want to only use 10 stocks and can we replicate the most of this basket

184
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,760
or most of the volatility of this basket.

185
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,360
And so we would do that by those vols sell the quibble,

186
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,880
which has a 76 implied core.

187
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,320
So basically we're buying realized core selling implied core,

188
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,300
and we're going to capture the spread between that.

189
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,470
But in this case, we're cowboys. You guys know we're cowboys.

190
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,380
And so we're just going to go outright short Vega and short the volatility.

191
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,670
Yeah, Tico. So implied correlation is usually going to be higher, right?

192
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,730
That's why there's usually a higher risk premium in ETFs.

193
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,460
And there is single stocks is because of that. So you wouldn't hedge Tico.

194
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,790
You would just let it rip, right? You're almost,

195
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,320
you're replicating the basket with these stocks and you're going to let them rip.

196
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,590
At least that's what I would do because it's super cost of like, this is,

197
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,910
that's probably a really good trade to do this, right?

198
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,030
But what we're going to do is we're going to see what the realized correlation is,

199
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,450
test it out, make sure that, you know,

200
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,500
realize the realized correlation is in between 50 and 90, usually. Right.

201
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,200
If that's the case and, you know, we probably don't want to be selling this,

202
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,140
but it's unlikely. It's very unlikely.

203
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,770
Okay. So that is what, that's really what we're going to be.

204
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,110
That's really what I wanted to show you guys today.

205
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,980
So you want to be a big seller so far. We're not a hundred percent. Sure.

206
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,310
Just yet. But a big seller of these quibbles.

207
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:50,370
Okay. And I think guys, so Jan,

208
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,410
2023 is usually a tree at 27 at the lowest point.

209
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,500
That's what I wanted to use as a PA terminal here to show you guys.

210
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,960
We plot the one-year vols over time.

211
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,660
We can see that this thing was trading at 27. It was trading at 28,

212
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:30,220
29 at a low at the lowest point during the debacle of the tiger cub vault went to

213
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,460
38. And now we're trading at 45 all. Okay.

214
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,880
So likely when things settle down, we're going to see vols.

215
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,020
I would say maybe drop, drop back down to 35, 33. If you're going,

216
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,020
if you're willing to hold it, which would be insane, right?

217
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,040
It'd be pretty insane considering all that Vega.

218
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,110
Actually, let's see Steve. Are we the only volume in Jan, 2023 today?

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,520
But we can't be though. There's must've been tons of buyers though.

220
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,020
Okay. It had almost no volume.

221
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,020
Interesting.

222
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,590
I wonder who buying it done.

223
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:45,130
There seems to be quite a lot of open interest here on the,

224
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:56,490
on these Jan 20, 23 calls a 60 strike like 10 K.

225
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,790
That's a ton of Vega monster size.

226
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,080
Yeah, no problem. No problem, Joey. Enjoy your swim, buddy. Okay.

227
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,980
That's going to be, that's going to be all for today. Have a good weekend,

228
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,080
everyone. Enjoy yourselves.

229
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,810
Take it easy and we will see you all back on Monday.
