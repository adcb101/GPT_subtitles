1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
Okay.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,460
Alright. So in this live, guys, we're gonna be talking about,

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,200
we're gonna continue on our series.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,500
So we're gonna be going into part 3 of our series.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,590
And this was for building our earnings model. So as you guys know, like,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,710
I'm taking this pretty seriously. And as soon as AMC trade us off,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,330
I'm gonna be basically going all in on earnings trades and trying to figure out

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,460
how much, like, how much alpha I can really make trading earnings.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,380
I know some of the guys in the group are already doing a fantastic job.

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,610
And I think bringing, like,

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,950
a really quantitative idea to the group and with their domain knowledge,

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,650
I think we could build something pretty fantastic.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,490
So we'll go through what I got so far for today's live. And then on Thursday,

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,490
we're gonna have a more in-depth live going over in more detail part 4.

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,450
Alright. So let's jump right into it. And please slow me down along the way.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,480
Alright. Let me get full screen here.

17
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,110
So the first thing we're gonna take a look at, just so we can, you know,

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,410
get back to where we were, we're gonna take a look at our data frame. Alright.

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,630
So quickly, here are our variables, right? You guys,

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,910
I've already sent out a practice data set for those who have asked.

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,520
And basically, we have implied vol data.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,260
We have contango and implied move earnings date.

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,600
We know the price of the stock, the volume, what time it was released.

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,340
We got event vol, non-event vol. And our target,

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,940
we'll go over all of these other variables in a second. But our target,

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,880
if you guys remember from the first live,

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,820
is our straddle P&L for the 30-day options. Okay.

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,120
So what was our P&L holding these options?

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,040
Holding a straddle from the close before the event to the close after the event.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,280
Now, my first day at this,

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
my first day at trading the model or a super naive version of it,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,840
I did pretty well.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,920
I think it was a $13,000 day for me with trading the strategy.

34
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,340
But I realized something during that. So something to keep in mind, guys,

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,220
is when you're actually building something out,

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,280
a lot of it is going to be domain knowledge. Okay.

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,240
It's actually one of the most important things. So for example,

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,680
I thought like if we could get a P&L of 5%,

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,820
then we're gonna make a ton of money, right?

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:48,140
But one thing I did realize was I was paying almost 5% on some of the names entering

41
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:56,960
and exiting the trade. So our original thesis was, okay, VRP, right,

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,040
was about 2%, right? And let's just, just to show you guys again,

43
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,940
we can see here that the mean was about negative 2.5%. So on average,

44
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,040
if we traded over 20,000 earnings events, each trade,

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,770
we made 2.5% if we shorted this of the straddle P&L, of the straddle price.

46
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,020
The issue, however, is this is imagining if we had no transaction costs.

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,150
And in reality, the transaction costs are extremely high, right?

48
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,930
A lot of these names are liquid. The bid-ask spreads are large.

49
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,430
Not a lot of traders, you know,

50
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,830
not a lot of market makers want to quote a tight spread.

51
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,190
And so we're actually gonna, just in transaction costs alone,

52
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,210
we're gonna eat up all this edge. And so we actually need more than that.

53
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,970
And just from doing the trades last week before this whole AMC debacle,

54
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,460
I realized like it's gotta be a lot more than 2%. Okay,

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,140
so that's just some domain knowledge that I'm adding to this now.

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,200
Let me just pull up the chat here, guys,

57
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,240
so we can chat about this as we go through.

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,990
Okay, so now that we know that,

59
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,170
it's time to really dig into this and see if we can, you know,

60
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,630
start to produce something that is gonna be tradable.

61
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,230
And I think you guys are gonna find this really interesting today just to,

62
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,450
you know, get a sense of how this all works.

63
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,510
So what I'm doing here is I'm actually creating a whole bunch of variables that

64
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,970
I think are gonna be predictive. And this is from my domain knowledge. Okay,

65
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,370
so one thing is gonna be the event vol divided by the realized volatility.

66
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,130
So one, I read a paper years ago that basically said,

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,720
the larger the realized volatility before the event,

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,060
the larger the move is gonna be.

69
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,920
And we need to really think about this for a second because the intraday move,

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
right? Think about just like the intraday move alone.

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,740
It's gonna be what regular volatility is plus some order of magnitude more,

72
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,440
right? There's gonna be more volume. There's more information coming out.

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,560
So we could take what the realized vol is now,

74
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,200
multiply it by some number and come up with a good estimate of what the actual move

75
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,930
is gonna be. Okay, so that's what we're doing here.

76
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,890
What's the event vol divided by the realized volatility?

77
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,650
So I'm creating that variable.

78
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,970
I'm also creating this variable called the implied move versus the average move.

79
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,350
So our usual thing, if the implied move is 10% and the average move is 5%,

80
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,710
well, that's gonna be a ratio of two.

81
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,070
And then I have the implied move minus the average move.

82
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,050
So maybe instead of like, for example, four,

83
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,770
let's say the implied move is three and the average move is two. Well,

84
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,170
that's gonna be a huge ratio of implied move versus average.

85
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,520
But it's only one vol difference. It's only not one vol difference,

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,100
1% difference versus something,

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,530
let's say that's 20% implied move and average move is 11, right?

88
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,030
The ratio is not gonna be as high,

89
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,050
but the size and the magnitude is gonna be extremely big.

90
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,660
So we added that in there. And then I created my own contango variable,

91
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,760
which is just the IV30 day divided by the IV60 day.

92
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,720
And I created dollar volume, right? Because sometimes, for example, people say,

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,770
oh, this thing has a lot of volume, but it's only $23 stock. So, you know,

94
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,100
it's gonna be different than, let's say,

95
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,240
a $10,000 stock with only a thousand volume. So multiply volume and dollars.

96
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,460
And then this one here is implied,

97
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,780
just the implied volatility divided by realized volatility, right?

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,140
Because a lot of the time, for example, we're selling a 30-day option.

99
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,680
And let's say the realized vol is 10 and the implied vol is 50. Well,

100
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,010
after the event, it's probably gonna collapse. All right.

101
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,710
So these are the variables that I'm working with right now.

102
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,890
We've got a couple more coming down the road in this section here.

103
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,270
But any questions about the variables we just created?

104
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,980
Nope. Okay. So we're gonna keep on going, guys. So what we're gonna do is,

105
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,300
and this is, remember, guys, as we're building our model,

106
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,560
we really need to think through the process every step of the way, right?

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,600
It's what makes us different than, you know,

108
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,800
the engineer coming out of Wharton, whatever it is, right?

109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,160
There's a big difference there. And that is our domain knowledge.

110
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,460
Our knowledge is a trader, okay?

111
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
So always think about the steps as we go through this, right?

112
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,340
Full understanding.

113
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,800
So what we're gonna do here, guys, is we're gonna plot the implied move, okay,

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,610
versus the absolute move. So we should see like some type of correlation,

115
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,120
right? Let's take a look here, right? As the implied move increases,

116
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,760
the absolute move increases, right? Would that make sense?

117
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,010
Does that make sense to everyone? As the implied move increases,

118
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,370
the average move increases, right? We're looking at all the stocks together.

119
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,140
And this is gonna be pooled, right? Everything's pooled together.

120
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,300
There's no partial pooling or no pooling, right? So for example,

121
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,800
Shopify implied move of 10%, of course, is going to, on average,

122
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,380
move more than let's say, Coca-Cola. But you guys can see like it's super,

123
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,880
there's a lot of volatility here. Like there's a ton of volatility, right?

124
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,740
So for example, sometimes the implied move was 30% and the stock pancaked,

125
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,510
right? Or sometimes there's a 5% implied move and then the stock moved 65%,

126
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,910
right? Maybe this is STNP, for example, when it got cut in half.

127
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,700
So there's no real correlation there.

128
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,480
But what we can do with this instead is we can say, okay, well,

129
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:31,060
what if we took the average absolute move and the average implied move and plotted

130
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,960
that, okay? And before I plot it, what do you guys think we should see?

131
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,040
We take the average move, okay?

132
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,520
And we plot that against the average implied move.

133
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:54,450
Yeah, Sebastian, how positive do you think that would be?

134
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,930
You think it would look like this? A little bit less variance,

135
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,670
a little bit more variance. What do you think?

136
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,700
Okay. Well, while you're thinking about it, I'm going to plot it here.

137
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,440
Less variance. Perfect. And in fact, look at this, guys. Oops.

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,410
There's a lot less variance, right? There's a lot less variance.

139
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,670
So what's this telling us? Well, it's telling us that the market is saying,

140
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,360
it's pretty good at estimating the average move, right?

141
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,970
But it's not the best at figuring out tomorrow's move, right?

142
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,330
So basically what we can kind of infer from this is that the market actually uses

143
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,210
the average move to price the implied move, okay?

144
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,250
And this shouldn't be a surprise to everyone.

145
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,510
That's probably one of the first things you would look at, right?

146
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,890
What's the average move? And then I'm going to price the implied around that,

147
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,470
okay? So it actually does a really good job, right? It does a really,

148
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:01,990
really good job.

149
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,090
So what we're going to do, so now that we basically know, okay,

150
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,670
the market is pretty good, right?

151
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:21,560
But the key thing that we can also kind of infer from this is if we just looked

152
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,100
at Apple,

153
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,100
we just looked at Apple,

154
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,180
we could see basically that when Apple's implied move percentile is the highest,

155
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,480
it's probably a good time to sell. And when it's the lowest,

156
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,500
it's probably a good time to buy, okay?

157
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,900
That's another thing we can infer from this exercise that we just did here.

158
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,350
So that's actually what we're going to do here now.

159
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,190
We're going to basically create percentiles.

160
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,650
So what's the implied move percentile? What's the skew percentile?

161
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,120
What's the curvature percentile? What's the dollar volume percentile, right?

162
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,040
We're going to start creating these percentiles now,

163
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,560
and that's going to be the no pool, okay?

164
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,860
So we just looked at a pooling example,

165
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,560
then we're looking at a no pooling example,

166
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,600
okay? So now that we have that,

167
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,940
let's just take a look at our data here so you guys can kind of see what's going

168
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,030
on. And we're going to go down to Microsoft or,

169
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,730
okay, let's go to CSX here. So we can see here, well,

170
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,150
basically what we did was we created percentiles, okay?

171
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,310
But they're called Z scores, the same thing. So let's take a look here.

172
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,720
The implied move, let's see what the biggest implied move was here. Okay,

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,310
looks like about 5.2%, okay?

174
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,510
So this is going to be actually a 5.2% move for CSX,

175
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,030
given all the other historical moves, is almost a two standard deviation move.

176
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, guys.

177
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,540
The implied move of 5% is going to be basically in the extremely high quantile,

178
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,140
okay? So implied move of 5%, you can see here,

179
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,060
is basically two standard deviations higher than what's usually implied.

180
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,340
And then let's go for, let's say, the biggest move, okay?

181
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,980
We'll go for the largest move and the smallest move. So look at this one here,

182
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:33,100
right? Negative 10%, well, that is two standard deviations,

183
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,980
2.2 standard deviations down move, okay? And if we take the absolute value,

184
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,890
it's a 2.2 standard deviation move, okay? So that's what we basically did.

185
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,990
We said, okay, well, let's look at the data and let's basically create,

186
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,020
for each individual ticker, let's create their own percentiles, all right?

187
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,860
And that's going to be actually very useful for us.

188
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,360
And I hope you guys are starting to see why we would do that.

189
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,680
And we're going to go actually dive deeper into that,

190
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,600
just to make sure you guys understand why we're doing this.

191
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,690
So what I'm doing here is I'm taking Microsoft and I'm saying, okay,

192
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,650
I'm saying, okay, let's pull Microsoft out of the data set only.

193
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,320
And we're going to look at a couple of things, okay?

194
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,880
We're going to look at the basically no pooling.

195
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,380
We're going to look at all the percentile data.

196
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,300
And we're going to also do it for a bunch of tickers, okay?

197
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,740
So we're going to look at Microsoft first. So let's take a look.

198
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,440
So we can see here,

199
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,660
as the implied move increases, okay, for Microsoft,

200
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,300
the absolute move doesn't always increase.

201
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,210
So if we were to look at this and say, okay, well,

202
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,450
where do we want to sell and where would we want to buy?

203
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,830
If there's no correlation here between average move and implied move,

204
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,560
we basically always want to buy the cheapest percentile and sell the most expensive,

205
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,600
okay? So when Microsoft is, let's say, 6% implied move,

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,280
we always want to be selling, right? Or 5%, we always want to be selling.

207
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,020
And when it's at 3%, we usually want to be buying.

208
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,730
And we can convert that to Zed scores or percentile. So you guys can see it,

209
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,080
what we're going to do later on here. Okay, so instead now,

210
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,860
all we did was convert these into the percentiles.

211
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,400
And you can see it's the exact same thing.

212
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,110
But this is going to come in very handy in a second.

213
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,680
So let me see the questions here. So just to make sure everyone's,

214
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm going to try to explain this one more time very clearly and you guys can ask

215
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,500
questions. If we look at all of Microsoft's implied moves, and we say, okay,

216
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,220
what were the highest implied moves? And what were the lowest implied moves?

217
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,620
We are clearly wanting to sell the highest and buying the lowest.

218
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,260
Because it doesn't mean if there's a high implied move,

219
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,650
there's going to be a high absolute move. Okay, does that make sense?

220
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,630
We want to sell the highest percentile of implied moves.

221
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,910
All right, so let me ask you guys a question.

222
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,290
Let's say tomorrow Microsoft implied move is 5.

223
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,660
Are we a seller or are we a buyer?

224
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,500
Sell, right? Why? Because sometimes it implies 5 and then it pancakes.

225
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,870
Like look how many times it pancakes.

226
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,510
So you basically want to be selling the highest implied and buying the lowest,

227
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,230
right? Because sometimes, for example, you buy a 3% move and it moves 6.

228
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,120
Okay, so we're going to do actually a really cool exercise right now.

229
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,400
And I really need you guys to pay attention and really try to understand this.

230
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,460
This is very important. This is going to be crucial going forward.

231
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,840
So let's really talk about this, okay?

232
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,840
So here, what I did was I took all those stocks that we did here. Microsoft,

233
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,900
Netflix, Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, okay?

234
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,760
And each one is a different color, right? But let's just look at Netflix here.

235
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,510
Let me see if I can draw. Okay,

236
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,250
you guys are going to see why pooling is so important.

237
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,690
So here it looks like our Netflix is, this encompasses most of Netflix's data.

238
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,460
Okay, you guys see that? So let's take a look at one point right here.

239
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,500
This point right here,

240
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:03,730
this was a day where Netflix had an implied move of about 6% and it moved absolutely

241
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,590
about 20%, okay? In this case scenario,

242
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,980
it was implying about a 15% move and it only moved 2.5%, okay?

243
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,580
And we could say that the middle arena, the middle area,

244
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,460
the centroid is what it's called, is right around here,

245
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,160
okay?

246
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,730
And then we can do the same for Bank of America,

247
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,510
which looks like it's right around here, okay?

248
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,600
This encompasses like all of Bank of America, okay?

249
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,640
And you can see there's little groups throughout this.

250
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,840
Now, right off the bat, we can kind of see that there's no correlation, right?

251
00:18:52,040 --> 00:19:01,680
That when the implied move increases, the average move doesn't increase, okay?

252
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,680
But at the same time, there kind of is a slight correlation here because,

253
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,050
okay? There's a slight correlation here because everything is pooled together,

254
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,910
right? Of course, if the implied move is going to be higher,

255
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,810
the average move is likely to be higher. But you know why?

256
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,140
It's because it's going to be part of Netflix's data. And of course,

257
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,040
when the implied move is going to be 1%,

258
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,160
the average move is going to be 1% because we're looking at Bank of America and

259
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Goldman Sachs data.

260
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,080
So what we need to do is we need to put everything on the same scale to actually

261
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,940
come to a conclusion,

262
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
all right? So let us do that. And we'll go back and really talk about this,

263
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,300
guys, because I need you for sure to understand this.

264
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,980
Okay, so here's everything. Here's no pooling.

265
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,520
So now we converted everything to ZED scores for each individual ticker, right?

266
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,640
So what we basically did, we said, here's Netflix's data all the way over here.

267
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,520
Here's the centroid.

268
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,480
And we're going to shift that centroid to where everything is, okay?

269
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,780
We're going to... And Bank of America was all the way down here at centroid.

270
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,140
And we're going to shift that centroid to right here.

271
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,170
So now everything's together.

272
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,130
And we can clearly see now that there is zero correlation,

273
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,260
okay? There's nothing.

274
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,240
As the percentile for any given ticker,

275
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,540
as we increase the percentile of implied move for any given ticker,

276
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,100
the average move percentile doesn't increase.

277
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,930
Or the actual move doesn't increase, okay? So if we think about this again,

278
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,130
we have 10 different tickers and we say, okay, for each ticker,

279
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,790
let's calculate what the highest...

280
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,770
Let's rank the moves and let's rank the implied moves.

281
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,920
And then we're going to plot them. And there's no correlation.

282
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,820
So we clearly want to be a seller when the percentile is high,

283
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:14,870
okay?

284
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,700
So we're going to start... We're going to actually start...

285
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,800
We're going to basically get into our first model.

286
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,540
Our first extremely simple model that you guys are going to...

287
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,160
I think you guys are going to really find interesting here.

288
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,470
So does everyone understand this before I move forward?

289
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,550
We're almost coming to the end here. Does everybody understand this?

290
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,430
This is so important.

291
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,280
Like, don't feel... Like, let's chat about this.

292
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm sure there's a lot of people who have questions. Okay,

293
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,960
there's no reason to be shy about this one.

294
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,940
Ned, ask, what's up, man? What's up? What are you thinking?

295
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,270
Okay, so here we go. So it looks like no questions. We're going to keep...

296
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,010
So what we're going to do is now we're going to say, okay,

297
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,710
let's take all our variables.

298
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,850
All the things that we think are going to be important.

299
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,980
So our quorum are saying,

300
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,140
what about bid implied moves on stocks with little data?

301
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,260
So do you mean like percentiles?

302
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,360
So in that case, Rob, that'll be tricky, right? Let's say you have stock with,

303
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,040
let's say, three earnings dates or let's say one earnings date. Well,

304
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
you can't really get a percentile. But the thing is,

305
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,860
that's not really going to skew our data, right?

306
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,460
We have 1500 equities and 20,000 events.

307
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,280
So it's not really going to mess around with our data,

308
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,450
but we are going to try to do techniques to make sure that it doesn't.

309
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,650
And in that case, Rob, we're going to have other variables. Like, remember,

310
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,390
we have all these variables here. And so if there's no implied move percentile,

311
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,880
then we can always basically use something else instead.

312
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,820
So here's all the things that are going to be accessible, implied move,

313
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,830
contango, skew, curvature, time of day. All right?

314
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,650
And now what we're going to do here is instead of doing the whole 20,000 earnings

315
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,640
dates, we're actually only going to randomly select 2,500. That's it.

316
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,840
Okay, we're going to randomly select 2,500.

317
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,740
And now, so we have basically... Let's take a look at our data, guys.

318
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Here's what we have. We have the no pool curvature, skew,

319
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,920
no pool dollar volume. We have also the no pool implied move,

320
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,140
which we just talked about right here.

321
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,980
And I'm just going to convert the time of day to a one or zero.

322
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:27,790
Okay, and let's... So now let's take a look at our data here. So funny enough,

323
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,650
these 2,500 variables that we just... 2,500 events we just sampled.

324
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:39,720
So we just sampled 10% of the data. The mean risk premium is also negative two.

325
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,120
So that risk premium of negative two kind of looks a little stable.

326
00:24:51,330 --> 00:25:02,050
And just making sure that the data is good. Okay,

327
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,010
so what we're actually gonna do, guys, for the first one,

328
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,590
we're going to run a very, very naive linear model. Okay,

329
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,250
and there's been a lot of issues with this because it's linear and our data is almost

330
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,810
certainly not linear. But we're going to run linear regression,

331
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,150
linear multiple regression.

332
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,820
And the reason why we're doing this is just to see like what variables might be

333
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,960
important here, right? What things might we want to see?

334
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,640
And I know I was talking about this. You can do random forest,

335
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,920
which takes a little more time. So we're not going to do it in this video.

336
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,940
To also get non-linear variables that might be important.

337
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,670
And let's take a look.

338
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,600
Okay, so super interesting. Super interesting.

339
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,090
We got just from running this on the sample,

340
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,650
we got two things that are really important here.

341
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,760
One is the no pool implied move. So this makes a lot of sense.

342
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,260
And I think this is actually one of the strongest variables out there.

343
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,540
So the implied move percentile, this is really strong.

344
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,000
And we're actually going to see how strong it is.

345
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,700
The other thing that's strong is this absolute average earnings move.

346
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:18,360
So it looks like the larger the average move is, the slope is positive.

347
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,380
The larger the average move is, the better our straddle P&L,

348
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,700
which is interesting, okay? And obviously, the higher the percentile,

349
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,980
the worse our straddle P&L. So basically,

350
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,600
just what we're getting off this from our first run through is that stocks that

351
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,110
have huge average moves, we don't really want to sell, okay?

352
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,870
So let's say if the absolute average implied move is, or sorry,

353
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:52,270
the absolute average move is let's say 4, and the implied move is 7 or 8,

354
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:00,270
that's probably a good sell, okay? But absolute average earnings move,

355
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:07,170
we actually don't want it big. But this is a super naive model, guys.

356
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,700
So we have to do more digging here. But let's take a look. This one,

357
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,680
I did a sample before the live, and this one also came out positive.

358
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,180
This one actually didn't. So let's take a look.

359
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,310
So what I'm going to do here is, I'm going to take our dataset,

360
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,850
and I'm going to basically break them into quantiles and say, okay,

361
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:39,130
let's look at the mean straddle P&L for the ones that have the highest percentile,

362
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,170
right? Let's take a look at that.

363
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:53,220
Look at this, guys. It's absolutely monstrous, okay? When we get into the 80%,

364
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:01,380
the 90%, the 100%, like the biggest percentiles, we start getting huge returns,

365
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,560
right? 7%, 8%, 9%. These are the returns we need for sure, right?

366
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,180
As we actually, as we go down the list,

367
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,740
we actually get into positive return area.

368
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,940
So buying straddles start to get positive.

369
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,890
So this variable, I'm almost certain,

370
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,790
is going to be a huge driving factor in our model,

371
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,300
okay? So implied move percentile. For each, for any individual name.

372
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,790
So if the stock is, let's say, 4%,

373
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,290
and the implied move percentile is the highest it's ever been,

374
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,470
so you sell that,

375
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,690
okay? So this, now this is just a naive model, guys,

376
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,890
so we're going to do more digging, but I'm almost certain,

377
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,570
just because I ran a couple of samples already, and this one always popped up,

378
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,820
but this is actually going to be a very strong predictor in our model going forward,

379
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:06,130
okay? So that's where I stand on this for today. It's 8.35.

380
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,890
Do you guys have any questions?

381
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,370
Robbie's saying, I was just thinking, if there's never really a correlation,

382
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,870
most newer equities would be overpriced with higher implied moves,

383
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:30,860
but that's a guess. If there's no real data, right? No real data. I'm sorry,

384
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,740
if there's no real correlation,

385
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,440
most newer equities with high implied moves would be overpriced. Yes, 100%.

386
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,160
100%, Robbie, or Rob, because something else that we're going to find,

387
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,500
I'm almost certain as well, is that the implied move,

388
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,600
the level of the implied move is usually a good predictor too,

389
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,780
right? Obviously,

390
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,380
like the data is going to tell us the most profitable trade is going to be a low

391
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,890
average move, a huge implied move, and a huge implied move percentile, right?

392
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,410
We're obviously going to find that to be the biggest, the best case,

393
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,470
but how many of those are we going to get a cycle, right? Can?

394
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,340
So we need more trades. And so we need to start, you know,

395
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,300
loosening the constraints and trying to get more trades in.

396
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,580
Is it moving, Rob? Don't tell me it's moving, man.

397
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,660
Yeah, so Ned's saying,

398
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,880
all these variables are created based on the realized move and not the jump.

399
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,900
So the reason is, Ned, is because I don't have open implied vol data.

400
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,680
I have close to close implied vol data.

401
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,160
So if I'm looking at the jump versus the close implied vol,

402
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,880
my data is going to be so biased, right? Because sometimes it takes, you know,

403
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,680
an hour, two hours, three hours for the vol to finally leak out.

404
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,560
So it's going to be, it's going to be tricky.

405
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,760
And also when you really look at like some of the stocks and you look at the opening,

406
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,580
a lot of the time, Ned, you'll see in earnings,

407
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,900
the stock doesn't gap at all because it just doesn't trade after hours.

408
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,100
It's too illiquid. And then the first tick of the day, it's up like 10%.

409
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,020
And that's not good. The open is going to still be basically flat,

410
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,740
even though the first second is going to be huge.

411
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,460
So the jump would look really small, but in actual fact,

412
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,920
you'd never be able to get out at that price.

413
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,770
Yeah, so all we're looking at this is from close to close.

414
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,830
We're not looking at the open. Now,

415
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
when we start looking at the open and we're looking at the close as well,

416
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,740
now we're taking a directional bias, right?

417
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,320
We're looking at the intraday move now.

418
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,030
And we can model that separately and get a small edge, right?

419
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,960
Because it's liquid to hedge in the morning. We might find, for example,

420
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,040
that before market open strategies or before market open times,

421
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,840
you want to do a hedge in the morning, right?

422
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,720
And these are the things that you can keep adding onto the model and get better

423
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
and better and better, right?

424
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,460
And that's why there's so much improvement you can do in earnings because it's not

425
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,760
really modeled that often. And there's a lot of edge there. It's hard to model.

426
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,640
And so there's going to be a lot of edge if you can figure it out.

427
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,720
All right, dudes,

428
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,200
everyone's all right? No other questions?

429
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,510
Anytime, Joey. Great seeing you hanging around.

430
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,610
So Ned has a question here and Steve says,

431
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,910
okay. So Ned's saying, well, vol drop can take 30 minutes to a few hours,

432
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,250
as you say, how can we account for the intraday vol? I.e.

433
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,870
we leave for a loss at 10 a.m. in the morning,

434
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,450
but it ended up being break even or winter end of day.

435
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,970
So that's the thing that you'd have to model that, right?

436
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,090
And you'd have to get the data. It's easy to get intraday data, super easy.

437
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,210
It's not easy to get close to open vol data, Ned.

438
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,310
That's going to be the tricky thing, right? You might find, for example,

439
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,650
it makes sense to close early in the morning, right?

440
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,690
So if we do model the move versus the jump,

441
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,160
the jump is always smaller than the move, right? It's not always small,

442
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,460
but on average, it's a lot smaller, right?

443
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,220
And when we can plot this here super quick for you guys. See,

444
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:55,040
I've already did it, but we'll just go like this.

445
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,640
I won't plot it because I can't remember the code for it, but okay. Oops,

446
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,240
yeah. So the standard deviation for the jump is 6%.

447
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,120
Standard deviation for the move is 7.9%.

448
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,800
So the move is usually more than on average in the jump,

449
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,740
but you would have to get that implied vol data, Ned, to model it. So for now,

450
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,820
we're going to do close to close.

451
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,310
All right, guys. Ned, if you have any other questions, hit me up in the DMs,

452
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,330
and I will chat with you guys later.

453
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,770
Try again, Ned, I'll be there. All right, see you guys. Thanks, Jordan. See ya.

454
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,200
What's up? All right, peace, bro. All right, peace.
