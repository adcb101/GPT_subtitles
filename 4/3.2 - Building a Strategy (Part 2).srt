1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:11,210
So, interesting, okay, okay, so we're good, yep, all good, awesome, oh yeah,

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,470
okay guys, so we're going to kick off where we started last,

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,810
and we're going to actually go another another layer here,

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,310
so remember how in last, just to get you guys up to speed, in last,

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,920
in our last video, we talked about what our target variable is,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
what our candidate variables are, how to start thinking about this problem,

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,780
some ideas, some problems we can start thinking about, and, you know,

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,080
if you guys want to take on your own projects, right,

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,220
just some ideas to get you guys thinking, to get, you know, to get you started.

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,700
So I've sent everyone who asked me for sample data, for the data,

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,860
I've sent you guys a sample,

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,880
simply because I can't send more than five megabytes over Discord,

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,900
so everyone has about a thousand data points for this project to work with,

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,140
and so with this lecture, we're going to be going to our next step now, right,

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,260
which is going to be really getting into understanding, you know,

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,920
more of our data, and, you know, actually trying to test some things,

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,300
and learning a little bit more about statistics as we go forward,

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,440
and just so you guys know, this isn't going to be like a three-part course,

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,020
right, like the thing with building models,

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,880
it actually takes a long time to develop, right, it's not overnight,

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,800
if it was overnight, you just, everyone would be rich extremely quickly,

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,820
so these things take time, and it's usually really hard to extract some alpha,

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,520
but I think after this live, guys,

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,180
a majority of you are going to be miles ahead of everyone else,

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,600
so let's get started here, so I'm going to share my screenshot. Yeah,

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,330
are you going to do a recap of where we left off? Yeah, yeah, yeah,

27
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,740
a little bit, so let me share my screen here, dude,

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,780
okay, and let me know, guys, if I'm going too fast, okay,

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,490
we'll really slow it down, so to recap, our target variable, okay,

30
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,950
so we're doing an earnings trading strategy,

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:15,110
and our target variable is our straddle P&L, so what is our P&L for, you know,

32
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,710
if we were to buy a straddle today,

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,470
what would that P&L look like tomorrow after the event, close to close,

34
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,670
so that's our target, okay, really important to understand that,

35
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,250
and you can go back to the last live to, you know,

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,610
to get caught up to speed with that,

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,560
so we're just going to recap here, we're going to plot our target variable,

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,700
okay, and you can see here, actually, we're going to get a little bit,

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,640
a couple statistics about our target as well,

40
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,720
just so everyone's back up to speed,

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,800
okay, so here's our target, right, you can see our max move is 500%, okay,

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,540
so we make, you know, if we buy a straddle for $10,

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,590
we sell it the next day for $60, and our worst P&L is 75%,

44
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:15,370
we lose 75% of our straddle, the median is, we lose about 8% on average,

45
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,170
and the mean is negative 2.5%, and this is just the variance risk premium,

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,330
right, so on average, and we would expect to see this, on average,

47
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,650
buying straddles lose a bit of money,

48
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,970
and here is what the density plot looks like, right,

49
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:37,640
you can see all the way out here, we have, you know, our 500%, our 500% winner,

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and then, but a majority of the time, right, so this is what white line here,

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,480
this is the zero line, so you can see most of our stuff,

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,090
the mode is to the left of the zero line, meaning that most of the time,

53
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,500
the median, we're going to be losing money, okay, and on average,

54
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,480
we're losing some money as well, okay,

55
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,360
so now that we understand what our target variable is,

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,300
we're going to start looking at our data, our target variable, remember I said,

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,150
guys, we want to spend the majority of our time on the target, right,

58
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,790
that's where the highest payoff is going to be,

59
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,010
a lot of people try to spend time doing the newest XGBoost model,

60
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,410
the newest AI model, okay, finding these new predictors,

61
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,030
the most return you're going to get is through working on your target, okay,

62
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,710
so we're going to jump into that, Sean, is there,

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,730
if there's any questions coming down to the chain,

64
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,790
do you mind just like letting me know? Yeah, 100%, I've got my eye on it,

65
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,670
I'll interject as necessary. Awesome, awesome, okay,

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,720
so I'm not bashing this guy, you know, I think he's really interested,

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,460
but this is a mistake a lot of people make,

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,620
and I think it's important that we really talk about this,

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,400
so Mitchell Rosenthal, he said, always impressed by how smart the market is,

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,800
especially when looking at predictive relationships, most times I come up dry,

71
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,340
something I found tonight had a lowish R-squared of 0.16, and big variation,

72
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,130
but still big enough to be considered, okay, so we'll take a look at this,

73
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,750
so just so everyone knows,

74
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,810
the R-squared tells us basically how much variance we can explain in our data,

75
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,670
okay, so an R-squared of one would look like this, okay, so let me just,

76
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,350
just so everyone's familiar with R-squared, because it's really important,

77
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,190
it would have a really high R-squared, okay, temperature today, okay,

78
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,110
and temperature yesterday,

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,880
so if temperature today is 30 degrees, okay, what is, what do you guys, sorry,

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,880
if temperature yesterday,

81
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,520
I guess most people are American, if temperature yesterday was 90 degrees,

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
what do you think the temperature today would be?

83
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Marcos is saying like 90. 90, like 90, right, and then if it was like 80,

84
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,840
it would be 80, right, and so you plot these, oops, sorry guys,

85
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,990
and you plot these data points, right, and it would look like this,

86
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,510
it'd be really tight, you know, it'd be a really good predictor,

87
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,220
and if we did the line of best fit, it'd look like that, okay,

88
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,350
and what this tells us is that the temperature yesterday explains a ton of variance

89
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,290
in the temperature today, okay, and this would have a very high R-squared,

90
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:56,990
and R-squared, guys, okay, is, can only be between zero and one, okay,

91
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,170
where one means it explains a hundred percent of the variance,

92
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,640
and zero means explains nothing, all right, so this guy is saying,

93
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,840
and just to make sure, guys, I'm not bashing him, I think, you know, he's very,

94
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,460
he's very inquisitive, and, but, you know,

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,780
it's good to learn from some people's mistakes, right,

96
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:29,530
so he is saying he found R-squared of 0.16, okay,

97
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,970
so his target, he can explain his target with six,

98
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,300
he can explain 16 percent of his target's variance, so let's go back to here,

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,420
so everyone, does everyone understand R-squared,

100
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,950
okay, it's, and also, guys, it's also, if you, if you square this,

101
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,750
you get the correlation, so this also means,

102
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,530
R-squared of 0.16 also means a correlation of 0.16 times 0.16, I don't know,

103
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,610
like, maybe, maybe 30 something,

104
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,030
okay,

105
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,970
higher, way higher, actually, like 50 percent correlation, okay,

106
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,300
so does everyone understand that, are we good on that one, Sean,

107
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,380
what do you think? That looks good. So he's saying, hey, guys,

108
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,940
I found this R-squared, so on his x-axis, he has some variable,

109
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,550
and on the y-axis, he has some variable, and he's saying, like, you know,

110
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,530
I only found an R-squared of 0.16,

111
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,710
and that's humongous, right, that's actually, like,

112
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,270
if you could get an R-squared of 0.16, that's ginormous,

113
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:48,240
but there's something actually more important in this data set that's,

114
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,980
that's not very good, okay, that he's, that he's forgetting about,

115
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,540
and this is probably one of the biggest things in, yeah, in modeling, okay,

116
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,980
and when we're talking about our target,

117
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,390
there's groups here,

118
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,360
okay, there's lots of groups here, so you might have a couple regimes, right,

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,420
you can see there might be this regime right here,

120
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,060
there looks like there's another regime right here,

121
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,460
okay, and there looks like, maybe they're groups, maybe there's something else,

122
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,540
it looks like there's another one right here like this,

123
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,020
and actually there could be a third one here,

124
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:44,960
a fourth one that looks like this, okay, so we, as, when we're forecasting,

125
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,080
we're learning about our target variable, we first need to understand,

126
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,060
is there a structure in our data, okay, this is called structure,

127
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,920
and we're going to talk more about it, and then can we fix it,

128
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,030
is there a structure in our data, and can we fix it,

129
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,010
so let's, let's get back to work here, let's get back to our work,

130
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,280
okay, so when we look at, when we look at this,

131
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,140
when we originally look at this, it's hard to tell,

132
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,420
it's hard to tell if there's any structure in our data, like, do you guys see,

133
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,500
like, a structure in our data would look something like this, okay,

134
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,400
okay, it would look something like this, right, where there's like other,

135
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,240
there's other groups,

136
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,550
there's other groups inside this, okay,

137
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,300
there's other, there's a bunch of distributions mushed up together, all right,

138
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,080
and we want to, basically we want to try to, and pick out what these are,

139
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,530
okay, a really easy one to look at would be something that looked like this,

140
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,160
right, this is a bimodal, okay, so there's clearly two distributions here,

141
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,410
all mushed up to one,

142
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:30,460
and we need to be able to pick these apart, what are these two groups, okay,

143
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,600
and another thing, guys, actually, we're going to,

144
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
we're going to get to that in a second,

145
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,710
so that's, that's so important, guys, I see,

146
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,310
I've seen Chris Seville do this so many times, it drives me up the wall, okay,

147
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,670
I'm not, not just that, but like, a lot of people do this,

148
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,130
and as a good forecaster, and as a good modeler,

149
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,450
we need to be able to pick those apart,

150
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,040
we need to look at the structure in our data, we need to figure that out, okay,

151
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,380
it's the most important thing,

152
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,140
all right, so what we need to do is, we actually need to do a little bit of a,

153
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,720
of a transformation here to this data set,

154
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,440
because it's hard to tell if there's structure like this, and so we do,

155
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,560
what we basically do is, we, we try to make,

156
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,820
we try to make that distribution normal, we apply some mathematics, and we say,

157
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,440
okay, can we make this distribute, if this distribution was normal,

158
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,460
what would it look like, okay, and this is what it looks like,

159
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,390
so here's our target, let's give that a second to load,

160
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,050
I don't know why it takes long,

161
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,870
okay, I don't know why it's not loading there, that old,

162
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,490
that old distribution that we just saw turned into this,

163
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,110
and we can see there's tons of structure here, right, look at this,

164
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,170
here's a hump, here's a hump, here's a hump, you know, here's a,

165
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,950
here's you know, in the shoulders, we're seeing a little bit, right,

166
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,970
there's clearly, this is not something, you know, that's normal, right,

167
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,530
and there's clearly a lot of stuff happening inside this,

168
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,530
but the good thing about this is,

169
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,590
it means that there's going to be a lot of edge here,

170
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,900
if we can figure out what, what are these distributions inside this,

171
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,010
what they are, we can make a ton of money, okay, that's the good news, right,

172
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:28,180
if it was just normal, there would be, there would be barely any alpha, right,

173
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,020
it'd be extremely hard to find alpha, and just to prove it to you guys, okay,

174
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,620
just to prove it to you guys, what is the most efficient market we know, right,

175
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,920
it's the S&P, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to get the S&P 500,

176
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:50,900
and I'm going to do the exact same thing with the S&P 500 returns,

177
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,560
the exact same thing, so imagine our target variable was the S&P 500,

178
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,470
look at this,

179
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,700
look how, look how beautiful this is, there's no humps,

180
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,620
this is like almost perfectly normal,

181
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,100
it's going to be extremely hard to find alpha into something like this,

182
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,170
right, to be extremely, extremely hard,

183
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,490
yet this is one of the most traded instruments by retail traders,

184
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,640
and like that's why we always say it's so important,

185
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,200
you want to find a game where you could actually generate alpha,

186
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,830
where you can actually make money. So Jordan, would you say that when you're,

187
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,370
when you're looking at, when you're trying to norm,

188
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,550
would this be called like normalizing your data? That's a different thing,

189
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,990
yeah, it's, we're trying to basically normalize it into a normal distribution,

190
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,190
it's not, it's not actually normalizing,

191
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:53,650
it's just we're trying to convert this using some techniques to make it normal.

192
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,610
Okay, so just to maybe make it clear, I'll try and put it in layman's terms,

193
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,970
when you're doing this to your data,

194
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,770
it's when you see those like humps and like lumps in the normal distribution that

195
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,870
you know there's something that's not like clearly understood or like that,

196
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,190
that hump is the opportunity that you want to try and uncover. Exactly, if the,

197
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,090
if the target that you're doing is tradable, so for example S&P 500 returns,

198
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,630
straddle P&L, right? If it's tradable and there's humps in the data, right?

199
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,460
That usually means you can find some alpha there, okay? You don't want it,

200
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,260
if it's perfectly smooth, it's going to be like,

201
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,560
obviously we can go more granular here and there is, this is not perfect,

202
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,580
there's not perfect distribution and you know,

203
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,620
you have some of the smartest guys in the world trying to pick those off.

204
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,770
Exactly, put it around them and stuff. Exactly, or they might trade,

205
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,830
let's say an option, because this is not the option data,

206
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:57,030
this is just the stock data, right? They might trade an option that, you know,

207
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,070
is not, is being, is not properly expressing the,

208
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,830
the distribution that they should, that they should see. Right,

209
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,630
so is it almost like you could say perfectly efficient markets,

210
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,820
this distribution would be perfect? Yeah, exactly, like exactly, right?

211
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:18,460
So if you're trying to delta trade the S&P 500, I wish you the best of luck,

212
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,350
right? It's gonna be extremely difficult to do. Okay, yeah,

213
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,650
I think this probably makes it clear, especially with that little explanation,

214
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,210
I think it makes sense. So Robbie's saying,

215
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,130
is it okay to assume that all distributions should be normal and smooth?

216
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,450
When you normalize them, if, so not all distributions need to be like that.

217
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,870
If there's groups in there, like obviously they're not going to be, but,

218
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,710
and like as we progress through these courses, you'll actually see like,

219
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,490
there are certain things where it's, it's not normal,

220
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,110
but you can find ways to like pick them apart and actually turn them into,

221
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,150
into normals, right? Once you try to, if,

222
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,310
once you try to normalize something into a normal distribution and there's no alpha

223
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,410
on it, it should look almost perfectly normal, like this,

224
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,220
it should look like this, right? Because if you look at,

225
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,870
if you look at what we're doing here, we are,

226
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,590
so this is called Gaussianize where it's a, it's a function in R,

227
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,350
but what we're actually doing is saying,

228
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,230
we're telling it a little bit about our data, right? Like in this case,

229
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,970
when we did this one,

230
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,570
where he goes in that load, okay, I'm just gonna plot it again, guys.

231
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,860
And we're looking at this one, but we're telling, so we're,

232
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,180
remember we talked about priors,

233
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,960
but we're telling our model here is that this thing has a fat tail, right?

234
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,340
And this is seen by this type HH. And then we're using maximum likelihood,

235
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,220
you know, a maximum likelihood estimate to try to figure out,

236
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,640
like try to smooth those bumps. And then if it's still coming out like this,

237
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,340
there's clearly like, there's clearly some alpha here, but with this one,

238
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,820
it's perfectly smooth, right? So usually, like,

239
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,590
I don't want to say in all cases, because I obviously haven't seen all cases,

240
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:19,240
but usually if your target's all bumpy, there's probably some money to be made.

241
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,680
Almost certain, there's almost certainly money to be made.

242
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,520
If your target's perfectly smooth,

243
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,820
a lot of people have already removed those bumps by trading the underlying asset.

244
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,430
Okay,

245
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,090
we'll take one more question here for now on this particular section and move on,

246
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,730
Jordan. Yeah. Arcorn's asking,

247
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,450
do you ever worry that some of the mathematics that gets applied to form your data

248
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,070
into distributions removes outliers that might actually be alpha,

249
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,410
but get normalized as noise? So I would say, I would say no, Robby,

250
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,830
just because we've already removed our outliers. So for example,

251
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,790
and I don't know if you were here for the last session,

252
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:08,120
but there were stuff like, let's say that were 19 times our target,

253
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,720
or not 19 times, 1900% winners. And so we kind of, and we,

254
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,980
we remove those from our data because we didn't think they were necessary.

255
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,530
And then all we're doing here is we're just trying to look at our distribution.

256
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,810
So we don't really care if some outliers are being removed here.

257
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,410
We're just trying to like look at it and like say, okay, well,

258
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,730
there's clearly some structure here. Right. So let's say for example,

259
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:37,310
like you can see here for this, I said, okay, only go from 0.6 to 0.5. Right.

260
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,190
If I maybe increase this, maybe there's a little bump in the tail somewhere.

261
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,640
Right. But I'm not really too concerned about that.

262
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,960
I'm really focusing on the meat here.

263
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,100
So, so now we know like basically, okay,

264
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,940
there's lots of groupings here and eventually we're gonna have to try to figure

265
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,530
this out. And just before we move into the next part, guys,

266
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,370
I just have some questions for you. Like, what do you think these could be?

267
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,110
Like, what do you think these humps could be here?

268
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:13,170
And also remember guys, our real data, right?

269
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,890
Our real data is actually going to be a bunch of these,

270
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,600
right? Our real data, it might be a bunch of these.

271
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,180
So what do you guys, what do you guys think? Like,

272
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,290
what do you guys think these, these bumps could, these groups,

273
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,130
these bumps could be?

274
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,450
So just to remind the guys, what data set are we looking at here, Jordan?

275
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,500
So here we're looking at our target.

276
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,840
We're always going to be talking about our target always.

277
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,820
And that's our straddle P&L,

278
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,040
right? So if we're looking at, if we're talking about our straddle P&L, what,

279
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,200
what kind of groups do you think there might be here?

280
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,450
Ned saying before market open or after close.

281
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,470
Ned, is this guy for real?

282
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,450
I literally had a call with him yesterday talking to him about this.

283
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,660
Sebastian saying people trading for different reasons.

284
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,790
Okay. I don't, I wouldn't, maybe like there's all,

285
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,290
you always got to try everything, right? But maybe I,

286
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,410
I'm not a hundred percent sure,

287
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,810
but I wasn't thinking, I think there's, I think there's easier ones,

288
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,450
different industries, different types of companies, a hundred percent,

289
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,590
a hundred percent like that one, right? Different tech, different sectors.

290
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,200
Maybe like the banking sector has a lot higher straddle P&L on average, right?

291
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,880
It could be like some fundamental, some fundamental factors, right.

292
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,900
Which would be like in the industry before market after close.

293
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,440
So that was one that I was kind of like working with and it was kind of,

294
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
it was showing some promise.

295
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,630
You know, you, you really want to think about this stuff.

296
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,630
So I can't stress this enough. Everyone,

297
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,090
the difference between someone who actually is going to make money in trading and

298
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,150
forecasting is actually going to spend the time to think about their data.

299
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,050
It's actually going to be an expert in there and in this field to understand like,

300
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,170
what should I pull out here? What should I think about?

301
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,480
What variables should I do? As you go through the forecasting,

302
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,780
you're going to see a lot of people doing high-end modeling.

303
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,230
You're going to see them doing the latest neural network.

304
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,540
We need to step away from that. Okay.

305
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,620
We really need to think about our data here, right?

306
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,140
Craftsmanship over whatever else is out there. Okay.

307
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,220
You really want to become a craftsman here and this is what's going to take you

308
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,920
to, you know, way above where everyone else is sitting at right now.

309
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,180
So yeah, you guys, you know, keep thinking about it. You know, Margin,

310
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,040
for example, Margin Kyle in our group, I always told him like, you know,

311
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,120
sometimes you're not thinking enough about this stuff, right?

312
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,140
You need to be constantly thinking like, okay,

313
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,820
what actually might go in here, right?

314
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,710
Instead of just like throwing everything at the wall,

315
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,530
you want to really think about this stuff over and over again.

316
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,640
All right. So onto our next step, we're going to jump into regressions here.

317
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:39,890
Okay.

318
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:47,330
We're going to jump into regressions and this is going to talk about or feedback

319
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,750
on the Twitter example we were chatting about.

320
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,750
So what I'm going to do guys is we're going to look at our first candidate.

321
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,170
Okay.

322
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,260
We're going to look at our first candidate here and we're going to look at the implied

323
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,540
move versus the straddle P&L. So what do you guys think about this?

324
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,210
If we increase the implied move. Okay. So if we look at stocks that,

325
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,560
let's say have a 20% implied move versus stocks that have a 2% implied move,

326
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,550
what do you think the straddle P&L would look like?

327
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,210
Do you think it would have a negative correlation, a positive correlation?

328
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,190
What do you guys think as we increase the straddle P&L or as we increase implied

329
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,530
move, what happens to straddle P&L?

330
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,310
Adam saying that if we increase the implied, the P&L should decrease. Okay.

331
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,270
So let's, and like how, if you were to picture in your head,

332
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,850
how would you think it would look like? Would it be a clear, a clear like,

333
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,280
would it be a clear pattern? Like would, if I showed you the graph,

334
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,440
would you be like, yes, this definitely has a correlation. What do you think?

335
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,300
And I just arbitrary arbitrarily chose implied moves. Adam saying probably not.

336
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,360
Okay. So let's plot it. Minimal correlation. Okay. Let's plot it.

337
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,140
So here it is. Okay. This is what it looks like.

338
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:19,150
So straddle P&L on the left side on the Y axis. And implied move on the X axis.

339
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,420
All right. So what do you guys think?

340
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,260
Do you think this is a good predictor or not?

341
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,050
Like I'm looking at this and I'm, I'm wondering like, should we even,

342
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,890
should we even consider looking at this?

343
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,490
Getting some nos, some yeses. Okay. So in this, in,

344
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,430
if we go back to what our buddy said on Twitter, he would say,

345
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:51,000
he would say definitely not. Right. If we do actual, if we actually do,

346
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,950
if we run a linear model, we run that model.

347
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,820
Okay. We get an R square, not even one, not even one.

348
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,560
And the person on Twitter was saying 16. That's too low. Right.

349
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:21,600
We don't even get one. Now the thing is guys in trading, this is a huge,

350
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,750
huge edge, but a lot of people are looking for these like monster signals.

351
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:28,810
Right.

352
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:35,020
But this is a massive edge and it's hard to really see it through this graph.

353
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,970
So what we need to do is we need to look at,

354
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,250
we need to really spend the time to look at this stuff.

355
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,810
Someone would have saw this scene on R square 0.004 and then moved on and said,

356
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,470
ah, you know, ah, this one doesn't work yet. This thing,

357
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,770
it could be the one of many pieces that makes you extremely wealthy.

358
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:05,490
So what we're going to do is we are going to take these implied moves and break

359
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,490
them into quantiles. So we're going to take 10%. So let's say for example,

360
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:19,220
we have implied moves ranging from one to 10. We're going to take one,

361
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,920
you know, and say that's 10% of our, of the implied moves.

362
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,420
Then two is another 10% and we're going to break them up into quantiles.

363
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
So let me just draw that out for you guys.

364
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,980
Okay. So here we have implied moves ranging from zero to 30, let's say,

365
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,220
but we're going to break them up into 10% chunks. Okay.

366
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:48,390
So we might say this is quantile, this is a quantile one, quantile two, three,

367
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,450
four, right. And inside each quantile,

368
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,970
this might have implied moves ranging from one to three implied moves ranging from

369
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,350
four to six. Okay. So we're going to do that right now.

370
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,390
We're going to take a look at this.

371
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,540
And this is,

372
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,740
I hope you guys are going to see like where some of the craftsmanship comes in.

373
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,470
So this is what we're going to do.

374
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,970
We're going to take all our implied moves and break them into 10 pieces. Okay.

375
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:26,620
And what we're going to do is we're going to look at, we're going to view data.

376
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,220
We're going to view our data here.

377
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,050
Okay. So let me just move this up here guys. So we're going to look at just,

378
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,350
for example, the first quantile here. Okay.

379
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,690
And you can see that these in the first quantile, we have like 1% moves,

380
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,650
2% moves, you know, one, 2% moves. Okay.

381
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,630
Let's see what we got in the second quantile.

382
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,240
We got like 3% moves, 2% moves. Okay.

383
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,620
And then when we get to the 10th percentile,

384
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,040
okay. Oops. These are the NAs.

385
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,950
Okay. Here we have like implied moves of 17, 18, 28, 16.

386
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,660
Okay. So now what we're going to do is we're going to say, okay,

387
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,980
let's make this bigger so you guys can, everyone can see.

388
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,980
It's a little bit tricky to see here, but I'm going to, I'm going to adjust it.

389
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,380
So, you know, we, we get, we get more insights, but I said, okay, like,

390
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:54,060
let's graph the PNLs now for each, for each percentile, right?

391
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,240
So if we look at, you know, percentile one with all the small moves,

392
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,360
that's this orange one right here. Okay. That's,

393
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,280
that's this orange one right here. And if we look at the, you know,

394
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,740
the ones with the biggest implied moves, that's this pink one right down here.

395
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,090
Now it's a little hard to see with these 10.

396
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:19,170
So what we're going to do is we're just going to plot the lowest,

397
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,910
the lowest implied moves and the largest implied moves. Okay.

398
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,160
And look at their, look at, look at their graph. So here we go.

399
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,380
Look at this monster, monster difference, right?

400
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,500
You can see that the stocks with the highest implied move clearly lose a lot more

401
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:47,060
often, like a lot more often. And stocks that have the smallest implied moves,

402
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,860
they lose, they, you know, they don't lose that much, right? Well,

403
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,700
sure they lose, you know, they lose often, but they got, you know, they don't,

404
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,000
they definitely don't lose as much and they have this big, you know,

405
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,080
they make more, they make more money a lot more of the time.

406
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,450
So monster difference,

407
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:12,220
but we weren't able to tell that by looking at that scatterplot, right?

408
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,500
We needed to look a little deeper.

409
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:21,350
And so what we're going to do actually right now is we are going to take a look

410
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,800
at this from a numerical standpoint. Okay. So bear with me here, guys.

411
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,720
Here are the largest implied moves. Okay.

412
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:33,900
Oops.

413
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,320
Here are the largest implied moves.

414
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,060
And then here are the smallest implied moves.

415
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,470
And look what happens as we go up the scale.

416
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,870
So this Med is our median P and L of the straddle.

417
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,490
And the mean is our mean P and L of the straddle. Okay.

418
00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:00,790
So you can see here as the implied move increases, right?

419
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,450
Our straddle P and L decreases tremendously. It goes. So the actually guys,

420
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,560
if you buy the cheapest implied moves, you will,

421
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,380
you will actually make money barely, but you'll make money.

422
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,940
If you buy the most expensive implied moves,

423
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,600
you're going to lose 6% per straddle.

424
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,880
Okay. Now this is, this is substantial, right?

425
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,700
This is a humongous difference here.

426
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,220
So keep that in mind. All right.

427
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:46,300
Keep that in mind that this implied move is actually,

428
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,670
we're definitely using it. We're definitely using it in our model. Okay. This,

429
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,250
and remember in, in trading, you're never going to have a signal.

430
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,150
That's a 25% R squared, right? Think about it.

431
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,210
If you could find something that explained the variance by 25%,

432
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,680
you become rich extremely quickly like this. You,

433
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,300
all you would do is just always take the best trades and then it would just disappear,

434
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,700
right? Because you're getting bigger,

435
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,880
you're getting bigger and bigger so quickly.

436
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,430
You alone are going to remove that edge, right?

437
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,420
And that's why you're never going to see R squared of 0.25. Jordan,

438
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,660
do you think you can try and like, help, help us conceptualize why you know,

439
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,260
an R squared of a 0.25 is like not, it's not what we should be looking for.

440
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,080
And really we should be looking for things closer to what we found with this implied

441
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,520
move. Is there a way you can help us conceptualize that?

442
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,520
I'm thinking like they just been doing with you know,

443
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,460
things that do predict that well are already priced in because they're obvious to

444
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:50,820
everyone.

445
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,200
Maybe it's something along those lines and we're looking for something more unique.

446
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,620
And then if you can try to really help conceptualize why something so small holds

447
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,880
so much significance. So think about like this guys, right?

448
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,870
Okay. So first off a single edge,

449
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,870
a single indicator on its own is not going to be enough to make money.

450
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,190
You're going to need a couple of them, right?

451
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,710
So that's why the small ones are still going to be there because you can't trade

452
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,290
them on their own. You got to combine a whole bunch.

453
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,480
Now let's take a look at this. Okay.

454
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,410
Let's say I bet $50,000 every single trade.

455
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:37,820
So every single trade I sell $50,000 worth of premium. Okay.

456
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Every single earning trade, I do $50,000 worth of premium.

457
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,230
And my edge is 0.0625.

458
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,770
And there's an earnings event during this earnings event or during this earnings

459
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,190
season, I can do 200 events.

460
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,320
So check this out during this quarter, during this, you know,

461
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,500
this one earning season, I'm betting 50,000 each trade.

462
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,390
I'm going to make $625,000.

463
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,240
Okay. Super tiny edge. Imagine this was, imagine, you know,

464
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:20,090
we got a signal and this became like 15%, right?

465
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,850
Where we're making $1.5 million. And you can see how,

466
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,080
if you actually do have a real edge and you're trading at a relatively high frequency,

467
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,230
you're going to make a ton of money.

468
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,300
And that's why these huge edges don't actually exist. Because if they did,

469
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,980
it would take you four quarters before you just totally erased the edge yourself.

470
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:47,050
And so if you're trading the S&P 500, you know, and you think you have,

471
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,210
let's say a good model that can predict, I don't know,

472
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:58,490
let's say adjusted 60% of the time. That's, that's insane. It would take maybe,

473
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,910
let's say two months or not even two months at 60%,

474
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,210
maybe like three weeks to figure out if you're actually profitable or not.

475
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Okay. Because you don't need a big edge in trading to make money.

476
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,040
You need a very, very, very small edge.

477
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,190
All right. So does everyone understand that? What do you think, Sean?

478
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,770
Sean O'Toole Bill had a question here. You said,

479
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:29,370
can you add other candidates and do like a logistic regression without curve fitting

480
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,550
it too much? Yeah. So you can do, so logistic regression would mean,

481
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,690
would imply that your target variable is binary one or zero, right?

482
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:49,160
In this case, we have a, a non-binary, right? So it's, it's continuous, right?

483
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,780
It can be 3%, 3.111%.

484
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,940
So we're running regressions instead of a logistic regression.

485
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:06,030
Okay. So, okay. One more important thing here that I really want to chat about.

486
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,750
So, is there any questions about that?

487
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,330
Cause we're going to be moving on to a very important topic.

488
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,330
I think we're all right to move on here. Okay.

489
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,810
So what is something that I mean, actually extremely, extremely, and Ned,

490
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,290
please don't, please don't spoil it, Ned.

491
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,470
I'd be really impressed if someone knew what was wrong.

492
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,380
What is like really wrong with that, with that graph that we drew,

493
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,620
with this graph right here,

494
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,420
like what's really wrong with this data or in general,

495
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,340
what's wrong with our data?

496
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,660
I'll give it like one minute there, Sean, just for someone to take a guess.

497
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,710
I'll shout them out as they come in.

498
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,200
Like what's, maybe you're not wrong with our data.

499
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,850
What's wrong with our target variable? Like there's something inherently wrong.

500
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,940
Lucas is saying not as many data points for high implied moves.

501
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,990
Robbie's saying the P and L is calculated at the end of each day instead of right

502
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,690
after the open.

503
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,610
Okay. Arcorn saying need more data. Joey's saying we have different groups.

504
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,330
Who's okay. Joey's saying different groups. Yes. Joey. Perfect.

505
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,590
So first off we have a ton of data. We have 30,000 data points here.

506
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,120
We definitely don't need any more data, but Joey hit it right on the head.

507
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,040
Okay. Joey hit it right on the head. We have, we have tickers. We have groups.

508
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,330
Okay.

509
00:38:53,330 --> 00:39:00,470
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to filter for Footlocker KO and Goldman

510
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:07,220
Sachs, three different moves. They should have different size moves. Okay.

511
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,900
And I'm going to plot their moves. Look at this guys.

512
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,540
Here's so blue is Coca-Cola's moves. Greens are Goldman Sachs.

513
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,350
And then red is Footlocker, right? The moves are drastically different.

514
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:30,730
And so we can't really compare a 5% implied move to Coca-Cola, Pepsi,

515
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:37,900
to Coca-Cola, Footlocker, and Goldman Sachs. We can't do that. Right.

516
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,840
There is basically no pooling. Okay. And there's no pooling until really,

517
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,380
this is probably the most important takeaway from this, from this live guys.

518
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,450
So we're have have a example here to really demonstrate it.

519
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,250
They do a really good job.

520
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,170
And then we're going to go into our data and take a look at it.

521
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,590
And we're going to actually do pooling.

522
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,410
And then we'll look into something called partial pooling and we'll save that for

523
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,480
next week. All right. So imagine, okay.

524
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,820
Imagine we are trying to predict the average reaction time of someone.

525
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,240
And then we look at the amount of sleep someone got. Okay. So,

526
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,740
and we looked at, let's say 400 people. And here I'm just showing you 20. Okay.

527
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,210
So we looked at 400 people and we just took a sample of 20 and we said, okay,

528
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:32,160
well days of sleep deprivation versus average reaction time.

529
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,000
So what do you guys think?

530
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,350
What would you guys think like the data should look like?

531
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,150
I know it's right here already, but let's, let's,

532
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,520
let's really talk about this and think about this, right?

533
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,890
As the days of sleep without sleep increase,

534
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,900
your reaction time should also increase.

535
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,250
It takes you longer to react to something. Okay.

536
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,350
But we can't just put everyone together and then run a regression.

537
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,620
On average, let's say Sean might be faster at reacting.

538
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,960
So he's going to have a separate model, right? And let's say Joey,

539
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,620
he's even faster at reacting. So he's going to have a separate model,

540
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,590
but that's going to, that's going to overfit. So let's take a look here.

541
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,940
So in the red, okay, we have no pooling. Okay.

542
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,060
No pooling means we just look at each individual's persons and run the regression.

543
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:46,210
Okay. The green line, the green model is saying, okay,

544
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,570
let's just put everyone's data together and run a regression.

545
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,460
Okay. We can't just do that.

546
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,900
And this is like one of my like big secrets of finance that, you know, I,

547
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,460
I spent a lot of time on this and I hope you guys are going to see the value in

548
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,600
it.

549
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,670
So the thing here is we,

550
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,490
it's not good to just pull the data and it's not good to just know,

551
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,390
use no pooling, right? So let's look at this guy's data here, Mitchell.

552
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,460
What's Mitchell doing here? He's just slapping everything together, right?

553
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,300
He's doing no pooling and he's trying to run a regression.

554
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,980
We're missing a lot of information there, just like in our data, our structure,

555
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,860
there's groups, there's things like that. And we need to account for those.

556
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,060
So in this dataset here, Sean and I, and Joey are still human.

557
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,220
We still have similar characteristics. We still live, breathe, eat, sleep,

558
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:56,990
do whatever. And so we want to get a mix of pooling and no pooling, right?

559
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,450
Let's go back to our earnings dataset.

560
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,360
We don't want to just look at the average move for each individual equity,

561
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,900
right? Because at the end of the day, they're all still companies. So,

562
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,720
but we don't, at the same time, we don't want to mush them all together,

563
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,860
which we were doing before, right? We want to say, okay, well, you know,

564
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,240
equities are still equity and they still have earnings calls and they still move

565
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,560
up when there's a big beat and they still move down when there's a big beat.

566
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,820
So why don't we use that data? We only have 14 data points for each earnings,

567
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,340
but we can look at someone else, let's say Footlocker and Macy's and say, okay,

568
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,400
well, this is how Macy's reacts. So let's use some of their data in our model.

569
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,360
And now we can get more data and that is partial pooling. Okay.

570
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,020
So what it would look like is we have this new line,

571
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,800
which would be this blue line right here. So it's,

572
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,910
it's kind of hard to see you guys. So green line is complete pooling. Okay.

573
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,510
So it's always going to be the same in every graph,

574
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:05,660
no matter what the red line, it fits only to this individual. Okay.

575
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:11,350
Only to that single stock. And then the blue line, okay. Uses a mix of both.

576
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,080
All right. And that is, that is the partial pooling. All right.

577
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,370
So you can see that right here. This is a zoomed in version. Okay.

578
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,030
And here's another way you can think about it.

579
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,050
And we're going to go a little bit more in depth here.

580
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,690
Here's another way you can think about it. If we look at,

581
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,630
let's say we look at the whole baseball season and we look at the first part of

582
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,500
the baseball season and we see someone hit, like,

583
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,920
I actually don't know baseball,

584
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,840
but let's say someone hit like an unbelievable amount of home runs. Okay.

585
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,800
And then we were asked to say, like,

586
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,300
what is this person likely to do in the next season,

587
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,640
in the next half of the season?

588
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,400
And a lot of people would go by the hot hand theory.

589
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,460
He's going to do just as good. He's on fire. He's killing it. Right.

590
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,890
But he's human. He's still a baseball player. Right.

591
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,090
So what we would do is we would say, okay, well,

592
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,090
what's the average home runs that we saw that we saw this season.

593
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,900
And we would say, okay, well, let's shrink him. Okay.

594
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,360
So he's all the way up here with like crazy amount of home runs and here's the average.

595
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:27,250
And we're going to say, okay, for the next bit of season. Okay.

596
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,290
He's probably going to be a lot closer to the average.

597
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:33,010
He might be still above because he's really good,

598
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,480
but we're going to shrink him down. Okay.

599
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,660
And that's what the partial pooling is.

600
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,130
We're using his data and things that are similar and pulling it in.

601
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,850
And we can get better when we shrink to something that is more reasonable or something

602
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:51,530
that's more the same. So for example, maybe he's a left-hander.

603
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:57,230
And so we're going to shrink him to all the left-handed batters.

604
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,650
I think that's what they're called. Okay. And the better. So for example,

605
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,590
instead of shrinking footlocker to all the stocks,

606
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,830
we shrink footlocker to all the stocks in that sector. Right.

607
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,210
And that's another reason, well,

608
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,250
obviously we're going to go more into detail about this strategy as we continue,

609
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,440
but what we're going to do now is we're going to,

610
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,460
we're going to do complete pooling. Okay.

611
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,700
We're going to do complete pooling here.

612
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,790
So what I'm going to do is take that data.

613
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,390
I'm going to take that data that we just saw there.

614
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,330
Let me just get it up here so we can look at it. Okay.

615
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,150
And I'm going to scale the data.

616
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,940
So basically complete pooling and we're graph it right. You guys,

617
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,440
here's what it looks like. So just, okay.

618
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,320
Just so you guys know what we're doing here is we're saying we're turning,

619
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,920
let's say so footlocker 10% move for footlocker is a two standard deviation move.

620
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,870
It's a five standard deviation move for Coca-Cola.

621
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,320
So we're putting everything on the same scale. Okay.

622
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:10,130
Boom. Okay. Now we have something that is complete pooling here, right?

623
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,970
So everything is on the same scale now, right? You can see, for example,

624
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,210
you know, here are the two standard deviation moves here, the two,

625
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,750
three standard deviation moves. Now we can model using this,

626
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:26,090
but there's obviously a better way. And that is the partial pool, but that's,

627
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,110
it's 855. That's going to be for our, our next live. Okay.

628
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,630
So just showing you guys some of the insights and like how we need to be thinking

629
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,150
about this data and like being,

630
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:38,450
being a craftsman here and not just like rushing into these things.

631
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,330
They take time, they take, you know, work and they,

632
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,690
you gotta be constantly improving. Brilliant. So Jordan,

633
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,230
a couple of questions for you here in the chat and a couple that I'm going to tack

634
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:49,790
on as well.

635
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,230
So we talked about a couple of different things that are more like data science

636
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,630
techniques in this rather than just the direct application to finance,

637
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,350
such as turning your data into a normal distribution, complete pooling,

638
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,730
partial pooling. And these are not necessarily finance specific, right?

639
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,590
These are data science specific things.

640
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,150
If somebody wanted to learn more about these things,

641
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,850
can they learn about it on online? Like, can they just Google these things?

642
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,850
Will they be able to find code in the language that they are trying to learn it

643
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:25,150
in by Googling them? Is this all a part of a package that you downloaded?

644
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,930
What's the deal? For sure. You can do all of this.

645
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,830
You can learn all of this online. A couple of good resources,

646
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:33,030
cross-validated Kaggle,

647
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:39,810
and then a couple of really good books from David Aronson that's directly relatable

648
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,270
to finance. It's not an easy read.

649
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,610
An easier read would be evidence-based technical analysis.

650
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,980
So that's a good one to start with.

651
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:57,930
Yeah. So I would say those three or four places to get your feet wet. Kaggle,

652
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:03,330
you know, type in EDA, exploratory data analysis on Kaggle,

653
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,610
where people actually get paid to forecast things and they show all their work.

654
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,190
See what they're doing, right?

655
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:14,580
And you'll see a lot of the times 99% is spent on understanding your data and learning

656
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,870
about it. Yeah.

657
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,270
I'm more so talking about just learning about the different techniques and actually

658
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,430
getting the code for them, so they don't have to maybe start- Oh yeah.

659
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,170
And all the codes on Kaggle as well. It just takes time, right?

660
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:31,200
Like if you want to become a good data scientist, it's going to take time,

661
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,960
right? But this is the stuff that happens at the top quant funds, right?

662
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,980
Where they bring in a bunch of quants and then they teach them finance and then

663
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,520
they say, okay, let's get some data. Let's get to work.

664
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,800
So Joey's asking, I guess, related to the partial pooling saying,

665
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,440
so maybe you would match them with their correlated stocks and create like little

666
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,350
baskets of stocks? Yeah, absolutely. Right? Absolutely. So sectors, maybe,

667
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,430
sometimes it's really hard getting your hands on good sector data.

668
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,660
You want to try everything, Joey.

669
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,820
You want to really think about it and then try it.

670
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,010
And then just to clarify, Tico was saying,

671
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:17,920
are you saying that like a 5% move is different for different stocks? 100%,

672
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,620
right? A 5% move for Coca-Cola is huge. A 5% move for Shopify is like normal.

673
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:29,080
Mm-hmm. And then Stephen B saying, can we backtest partial pooling?

674
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,540
Like in the baseball example,

675
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,620
can we test how well it worked in the past and how much shrinkage we should use?

676
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,330
Yes. So that's going to be for another day, Stephen,

677
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,990
but you can actually graph like over time how well your model is doing. Like,

678
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,310
is it getting better? Is it getting worse? And that's a good method to use.

679
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,530
Partial pooling is used in like some of the best sports betting models.

680
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,780
All right. So that seems to be all the questions.

681
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,960
We're going to end the session here, just before we do the good stuff. Jordan,

682
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,840
another great live and I will be posting this up shortly. Yeah.

683
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,700
And next live guys, we're going to start getting into more of our data,

684
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,060
learning more about our dataset and starting maybe in a couple more,

685
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,480
we're going to actually build out, start building out the model and testing it,

686
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:22,950
backtesting it across, you know, a walk forward analysis,

687
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,010
cross-sectional analysis, all that stuff is going to happen.

688
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,210
And we're going to build something out good. We're going to make some money.

689
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,890
Exactly. And then we're all going to get rich guys. All right.

690
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,460
See you guys on the next live. See you.
