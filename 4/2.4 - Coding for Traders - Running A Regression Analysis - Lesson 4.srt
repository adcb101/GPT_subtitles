1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,570
Okay guys,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,510
so welcome back to our part for the real part for last one was actually part three

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,970
We're gonna actually go over a few things today. So we're gonna do regressions,

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,730
but we're also going to use alpha vantager to pull in intraday data from an API

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,590
as well as Daily data and the reason why I'm doing this.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,710
I'm showing you guys this now is because one of our members Enrique is having problems

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,740
with quant mod and And this is actually an uncommon problem But it's still it still

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,820
happens every so often where the way your computer is set up Depending on if you

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,440
have our curl installed you might have troubles pulling data in from quant mod So

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,420
I think you know the new ways alpha vantager.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm just used to using quant mod I think it's a little simpler,

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,460
but we're gonna go through this anyways so first thing is guys whenever you see

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,340
me library a package like library tidy quant and library alpha vantager This just

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,980
means that I've already installed it So you have to go and every time you see like

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,040
let's say library tidy quant that means you have to install tidy quant And then

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,160
once you do that you can now library it in so I'm gonna delete that You guys have

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,520
to both you guys have to library both tidy quant and alpha vantager it so Let's

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,620
go ahead So what is tidy quant tidy quant?

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,980
Tidy quant is basically the data frame version of Quant mod so quant mod is some

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,440
is in something called an XDS Okay, so it's basically a program.

21
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,760
It's basically are written on top of C++ So you can think of it like this right?

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:57,130
Let's say we did Let's say we should get symbols SPY

23
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,690
All right, and now we go class so class tells us. What is this?

24
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:13,230
What type is this right class SPY It's an XTS slash zoo This is a special type of

25
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,910
class written by a lot of the C++ programmers and are Who have basically integrated

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,590
the two?

27
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,460
But let's use tidy quant so tidy quant has a function called TQ get where it's very

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:34,410
similar to So here pulls in right here,

29
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,350
so we have to actually save this so we have to say Apple equals TQ get and now if

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:49,930
we go so if we do head Apple right we see that here's here's the head of our data

31
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,670
frame, but if we go class Apple we can see that it's not an XTS.

32
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:04,010
It's a it's a data frame So that's the two that's that that's the difference between

33
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,110
Between the two and there's actually some subtle differences It might be a little

34
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,910
easier to work with a data frame rather than XTS When we get to speed purposes for

35
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:19,970
like example backtesting we're gonna have to use an XTS So what we're gonna do actually

36
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,580
we're gonna start pulling in intraday data And then we're gonna work on some we're

37
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,340
gonna look at some regressions So to do this you guys have to go online And you

38
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:39,770
go to alpha vantage Co right here You click on get your free API today So click

39
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,960
on that and then just fill out the information here,

40
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,740
and I will come a code So what an API is is basically something your computer is

41
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:56,620
interacting with that holds data right so out there in the world is some data frame

42
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:03,620
and You want to connect to that data frame in order to connect to it your computer

43
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,720
has to connect?

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,880
To something to communicate with that data frame and that is what is called an API

45
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,620
So R is gonna talk to this API and then that API is gonna collect the data from

46
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,980
Alpha vantage and another thing guys is that R is only the best programming language

47
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,990
in the world because of its community When you have a question there is someone

48
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,370
who already has asked this question before you need to start using stack overflow

49
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay stack overflow.

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,230
I want everybody to sign up today on stack overflow What this is is when you have

51
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,750
a question?

52
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,190
There were people there will be people who will answer it for you in fact if you

53
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,850
have a question Tag it in the group,

54
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,950
and I'll go and answer it for you So if you look at my profile for example I Asked

55
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,670
her let's see what questions.

56
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,910
I've recently asked so I'm a silver badge Which basically means that I'm a very

57
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,110
good programmer But I'm just not the best the best would be a gold badge And then

58
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,810
everybody starts out with no badge,

59
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,130
then you move up to bronze and then silver and then you hit gold So let's take a

60
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:18,530
look at one of the questions that I asked is How to separate on a first period So

61
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,070
I have a data frame and this data frame has two periods one here and another period

62
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,150
here And I want to split it on the first period All right,

63
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,110
so I asked my question.

64
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,090
I showed the code that I've tried I show what I want to happen and then Someone

65
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,570
will come and answer the question for me,

66
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,990
and now I can learn from them now so for example we have Akron who's probably one

67
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,190
of the best our coders in the world and He is here who's able to help me,

68
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,310
and this is such a good resource You're learning from a lot of the best programmers

69
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,890
in the world Okay, so once we have our API key.

70
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:02,510
We're gonna come over here a V API Key you're gonna put in your API key,

71
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:37,570
so my API key is you can get it Okay,

72
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,530
so we get our AVI we put in our API key once you put in our API key We can now start

73
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,450
using the code so if you guys have any questions about Alpha Vantager there's documentation

74
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,810
so the thing with programming is it is a little bit tedious, right?

75
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,150
But as you get better and quicker everything gets a lot smoother So you go to the

76
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,780
back to the home page API documentation examples boom Okay,

77
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,300
so here is all the stuff you can get you get intraday data daily data daily adjusted

78
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,220
data so for dividends and splits Weekly data weekly adjusted you can get 4x You

79
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,250
can get cryptos you can get technical indicators What else can we get here?

80
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,130
We can get sector performance so you can get all this stuff,

81
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,830
so let's say we go to We're gonna look at equities here,

82
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,970
let's what do you guys want to do?

83
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,550
Let's do okay because we're doing regressions. Let's do daily data,

84
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,470
but you can you can as simply get intraday data We're gonna go with daily data here.

85
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,290
Okay, so what we need to do here.

86
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,560
We have to put in these commands So let's take a look at our let's take a look here,

87
00:07:45,640 --> 00:08:02,010
so question mark AV Get let's see what we need So

88
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,030
right here perfect,

89
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,070
so here's an here's our example right we're gonna have right here right down here

90
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,260
So we're gonna have a V.

91
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:25,440
So let's call it Microsoft is equal to a V get Symbol equals Microsoft AV fun equals

92
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,690
Okay, so this is where this comes in right?

93
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,630
This is this So function time series daily,

94
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:52,270
let's do that instead of Let's do that instead of intraday so and then

95
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,330
output size,

96
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:03,620
so if we just do compact so output size Equals full if we do compact.

97
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:13,180
It's just the first hundred rows, so let's run that Well,

98
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,880
I took a little while. I'm not very happy with that,

99
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:28,260
but anyways Let's take a look Let's view our data And here it is So here's our days

100
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:35,990
open high low close and volume for Microsoft With alpha vantage or you can't get

101
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,890
batch symbols, so you can't get three symbols at one call So what we're gonna.

102
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:51,000
Do here is we are going to First load in the package called tidy verse tidy verse

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,770
is a suite of function that's run on C and It's very good.

104
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,810
It's super fast for doing any data manipulation Because AV get will only pull in

105
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,570
one symbol. We have to run this twice,

106
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:13,840
so we're gonna run in we're on SP Y equals AV get Symbol equals SP. Why AV fun?

107
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:32,270
time series daily and output size equals Let's

108
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,480
do compact here Okay,

109
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
so if we look you over here in our environment We have SP Y which only has a hundred

110
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,560
observations and Microsoft which has five thousand observations That's because we

111
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
did compact here right if we look over here.

112
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
We did compact and we did full for Microsoft So we pulled in the full data.

113
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,800
I really pulled in a bit of the data for SP Y So we want to run a regression here

114
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,590
But what we need to do though is we need to merge these data frames together Right

115
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:11,100
how do we do that one is a hundred rows and one is 5,000 rows so it won't work right

116
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,410
if we did C bind SP Y and Microsoft which means column bind What's gonna happen?

117
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,150
We're gonna get an error because SP Y is not the same length as Microsoft.

118
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:30,050
They have different dates So what we need to do though now is we need to call inner

119
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,090
join so inner join says Take something on the left.

120
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:46,240
Let's say SP Y and only get the matching columns from another data frame So we're

121
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:58,850
gonna do this final dot DF equals inner join SP Y and Microsoft But by what by the

122
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,450
open the closed the high the low What we want to inner join is by the date so we

123
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:14,410
go by equals Let's see what the names are so we can type down here names SP Y time

124
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:23,820
stamp so by equals time stamp Boom now check this out. We have our final DF,

125
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:33,510
which only has the hundred rows from SP Y and It's added Microsoft So time stamp

126
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:40,450
right here This is all SP Y and then so this so are added because you can't have

127
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,450
the two columns of the same names So are said that these ones are called closed

128
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:52,690
X These ones are added added an X to the to the end of the variable and then over

129
00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:00,930
here We added a Y to the variable for Microsoft So what we can do now is we're gonna

130
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,070
run our first regression So we're gonna look at the first we are going to look at

131
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,410
the own the first and only math equation That I'm ever gonna talk about in this

132
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:15,710
group, and that is linear regression equation the formula is Our prediction,

133
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:25,910
let's call it y hat This is what we think is gonna happen Okay Is equal to?

134
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,010
Alpha let me just add a thing here.

135
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:38,730
Okay alpha plus beta Times our Variable that we're regressing it with our independent

136
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:47,480
variable So we'll call that X plus an error term So what is this equation telling

137
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:55,470
us this equation is saying that our variable that we're going to predict Our Y right

138
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,770
our y-axis, so maybe this in our case what we're gonna.

139
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:12,880
Do is Microsoft is Equal to is equal to some intercept plus the change in SPY Plus

140
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,760
an error term because we can't predict it perfectly so there's gonna be an error

141
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,200
This is the linear equation, but first for you on our regression.

142
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,560
We need to turn everything into return space right now We're in price space right

143
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,370
if we look at Our final DF everything is in price We have Microsoft price.

144
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:42,600
We have SPY price So we're gonna call Microsoft price equals ROC so ROC is just

145
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:59,650
a way to change it which is equivalent to the return of Final DF Why close why and

146
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:05,900
we're gonna go SPY Oops, sorry guys.

147
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:19,050
We're gonna call it return MSFT return SPY Return equals ROC final dot DF close

148
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,140
X Okay,

149
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,200
and now so if we take it we have two vectors here now right let's take a look at

150
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,880
SPY return So it's not a data frame anymore.

151
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,940
It's just a vector So what we can do now is we can say We're gonna create a new

152
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:56,350
data frame so new Or let's call this one return DF Equals to data frame MSFT

153
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:06,820
return equals MSFT return so this is saying The column is called MSFT return,

154
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,780
and we're gonna fill it with MSFT return We have another column called SPY return,

155
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,520
and we're gonna fill it with SPY return And we're gonna hit enter and now let's

156
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,390
take a look at this And there it is here's our daily returns,

157
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:28,190
so we can now let's plot some of this stuff So first let's remove the NA see how

158
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:37,280
we have an NA here Let's get rid of it So we'll type in return dot DF equals NA

159
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:52,380
dot omit return Dot DF Okay So let's take a look gone We are going to Let's

160
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:01,850
plot one of them plot return DF MSFT we're gonna do type Equals line,

161
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,310
and we'll do call equals red color equals red okay So here it is right here.

162
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:16,770
You're the daily returns now in order to Make it look like Microsoft's price again.

163
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,350
We have to run the cumulative sum function so plot Come some right we're gonna do

164
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:40,500
cumulative some return dot DF Microsoft return type equals line and call and Call

165
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,710
equals blue Okay,

166
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:50,790
and there's Microsoft's return of the last hundred days now We want to know what

167
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,250
we want to do a regression,

168
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,930
so you know when you see what a company's beta is It's simply a regression it's

169
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:04,310
Simply this right in our in our Now we're a regression right now.

170
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,710
We're gonna be asking the question. What is Microsoft's beta? okay,

171
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:16,720
so That is going to be equal to this big B right here Right and think about like

172
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,760
this We have on the y-axis.

173
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,640
It's gonna be Microsoft is equal to Some alpha which is gonna be should be close

174
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:35,460
to zero plus the beta Times SPY so if the beta is 2 what that tells us is Microsoft

175
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:43,250
is going to move 2 times whatever the S&P moves so if S&P moves down negative 1

176
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,370
If beta is 2 then you're gonna have this would be the equation the equation would

177
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:58,510
be Microsoft move is Equal to let's say alpha is 0 plus 2 times Whatever S&P moves,

178
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:05,830
let's say it moves 1% Plus some error term because it's not gonna move exactly it's

179
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:12,090
gonna move has it's gonna move almost So that is the equation All right,

180
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,550
let's say there.

181
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,110
Let's say we can let's say we're we're magicians or we're 4x traders,

182
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,990
and we don't have any errors So let's do that,

183
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:28,760
and then you're gonna see that Microsoft move now For at the T is Equal to 0.2 right

184
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,700
S&P move 10% Microsoft's gonna move 20% So what we need to do first is we need to

185
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:50,860
plot the data so plot Return dot DF Microsoft regressed on to That and that's what

186
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,300
the tilde sign is the tilde sign is regress so think of it What are you this?

187
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:02,660
What are you regressing y-axis on so this is your y-axis on to what and in our case?

188
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,870
It's the S&P 500 Okay,

189
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:19,950
and let's say call equals blue So here it is so here is our first regression So

190
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,790
what do we notice here?

191
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,990
well We see that there's a strong correlation Right when the S&P return is 1% Right

192
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:38,120
Microsoft is gonna be around 2% When the S&P is down 1% Microsoft is gonna be down

193
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,820
1% so there's a clear correlation here But we're quants.

194
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,220
We don't we don't just say oh,

195
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,360
there's a correlation and move away We need to actually come up with a number that

196
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,920
says okay if S&P moves this how much is Microsoft gonna move?

197
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,820
So what we do is we have to we have to create a line a best fit And that is this

198
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,560
equation right here.

199
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:06,040
This is the ordinary least squares linear regression So what we're gonna.

200
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,140
Do is we're gonna say We're gonna add a line Okay,

201
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,330
and we're gonna add this linear model LM means linear model And we're just gonna

202
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:27,610
do Same thing return dot DF Microsoft regressed on to return dot DF SP Y and we're

203
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:35,480
gonna make the color equals Let's say red and there it is so this line is the line

204
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,080
of best fit it minimizes the error terms so now we have a line that says okay if

205
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,690
If S&P goes up 1% we just go up here,

206
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,450
and we say okay Microsoft should go up It looks like one and a half percent,

207
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,330
so we're gonna build our model right so our model is our first mod Equals to LM

208
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:06,210
Return dot DF Microsoft return regressed on to return dot DF SPY Okay,

209
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:14,120
so that's our model We're gonna go summary our First mod and we're gonna print this

210
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,190
to the console So what this is saying is that?

211
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,130
The p-value is basically zero what this means is that?

212
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,460
S at the S&P return Has a strong correlation, and it's not by chance.

213
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,800
It's it's almost certain that this is a real thing Okay,

214
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,660
that the S&P is correlated so in order to actually really dive deep into what a

215
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,560
linear regression is I think that's beyond the scope of this context because when

216
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,160
it comes to a lot of the statistics stuff There's so many good videos.

217
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,140
I explained a lot better than I will be able to explain it So if you guys want to

218
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,400
do that you know I'd highly recommend you guys go and learn statistics online But

219
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,860
we are gonna be specifically focused around Quantitative using taking that information

220
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,670
and using it for quant trading So what this is saying is here.

221
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,830
Here's our coefficients. Here's our intercept.

222
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,450
Here's our alpha remember we come over here Where do we have it right here?

223
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:20,430
So this equation is summarized right in here our equation is Microsoft return okay

224
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:35,270
is equal to The intercept which is our alpha so is equal to point zero zero one

225
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:50,580
six five six five three Plus our beta term 1.292 times our S

226
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:59,040
&P 500 move So let's say the S&P moves point zero two Plus some error term so in

227
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,440
our case.

228
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,970
We are going to just say it's zero So what we're saying is I have micro if S&P moves

229
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,710
up two percent Microsoft is going to move.

230
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:18,530
Let's take a look MSFT return Point zero two six three so if S&P moves up two percent

231
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,690
Microsoft is gonna move up two point six percent Right and we can change this so

232
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:35,870
let's say we want let's say S&P moves down one percent Microsoft is Gonna move down

233
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,570
1.2 percent plus minus right that's our error term error terms we plus minus and

234
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,150
we'll get into that into another video How do we get a standard deviation for error

235
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,370
term?

236
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,740
But this is our beta right so the beta over this time period is 1.292,

237
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,850
so we just calculated the beta for an equity So that is our linear regression guys

238
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,990
I Hope that made sense we'll go into more details about linear regressions and robust

239
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,330
regressions Because what happens if we have a huge outlier in this data,

240
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:11,930
so I hope this guy's made a little bit of sense This is just an introduction to

241
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,730
doing regressions for statistical statistical analysis,

242
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,290
and I'm sure you guys are already thinking well What happens if?

243
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,750
Microsoft moves down 10% and S&P doesn't move well now.

244
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,490
We're getting into something called pairs trading And this is an amazing topic that
