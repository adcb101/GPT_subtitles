1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,430
Okay, so guys in this live,

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,790
we're going to talk about the JD trades start to finish.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,910
Basically how this whole thing unfolded and you guys are going to be able to see

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,230
how like a great trade went from, you know,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,390
like the whole process of how this happened.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,620
So just so you guys know, this might be a little bit more advanced. So please,

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
there's no dumb questions. If you have a question, you know, don't hesitate,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,040
stop, ask, and we will, we'll answer the questions. So I guess,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,780
let me pull up the chat here.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,760
Yeah, the trades, it's over now. It's over now.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:55,330
So we're going to start this off. So this morning, I was already positioned,

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,440
right? Sean and I, we already had a position on, right?

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,360
So what we were betting on was we had a position on for quite some time now,

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,120
right? And it turned out to be very profitable.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,540
So Neil actually did a live on this guys, where you can see,

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,520
so I think it's just two weeks ago. Yeah. When we initiated the trade,

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,860
Neil did a whole presentation on it. I just want to see who's on the live.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,460
Is Neil on the live?

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,070
Yeah, he is. Okay.

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,770
So Neil, Kyle chime in here.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,910
So okay. So we already had a position on, okay.

22
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,810
And if you guys want more information on how the position was structured,

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,570
you know, you can take a look at that live,

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,170
but what we're basically betting on was when the earnings date would be.

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,010
When JD would release their earnings date.

26
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,890
So we believed it's going to be on November 16th, okay.

27
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,060
Which is after the November 13th expiration. However,

28
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:08,300
the market was pricing in a November 13th earnings date. Okay.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,780
November 13th earnings date, and we were betting on November 16th.

30
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,130
So we had this position on for a little while. So to structure this trade,

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,930
we had to create a calendar spread.

32
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,480
So what we did was we sold the overpriced volatility in November 13th.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,600
Remember the market is saying,

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,860
this is where the volatility is going to be on November 13th.

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,390
So we sold that because we said, it's not going to be there, right?

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,190
If we take out that event vol, all of a sudden vol drops.

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,180
So we sold that and to hedge that short vol and that short gamma,

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,270
we bought the November 20th. Okay.

39
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,870
And so you guys can see the structure of the trade right here, right?

40
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,760
Short the 90, November 13th, long the 90, November 20th, right there. Okay.

41
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,660
That's what it looks like. And now it's going for $1.43, but funny enough,

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,700
actually, we put on this position for 35 cents, right?

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,880
We actually did the 90 and the 75 calendars for a total of 71 cents total,

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:26,330
all in. So currently the position looks something like this, right?

45
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,670
Obviously I exited this morning and we'll talk about why,

46
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,270
but this is what the position currently looks like. Right. It was extremely,

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,130
extremely profitable.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,500
Yeah. So code saying, what about just being long only?

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,510
So you couldn't because the real mispricing was in the November 13th. Okay.

50
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,470
It was in the November 13th. You had to be selling that.

51
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,990
You couldn't just be long the November 20th.

52
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,640
Okay. So what happened this morning? So this morning, you know, had my,

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,400
had my little meeting with the, with the junior analyst Neil gang and you know,

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,600
here's the conversation, right?

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,040
So Neil mentions that I vol for the November 13th had dropped below the November

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,760
20 by a sizable amount, right? You guys can see from that graph right here.

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,920
So this tells us that finally the market said, okay, you know what, Neil,

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,450
you're right. The earnings date is going to be November 20th. Okay. So,

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,150
you know, so here I asked Neil in the morning, I said, Neil,

60
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,390
when you get a chance, please look at JD. There's a market pricing.

61
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,950
The market's pricing in November 13 because when I looked at the market earlier

62
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:46,670
this morning, it had November 13 above November 20, AKA there was still,

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,210
there was still a trade to be made. We should be getting more size on.

64
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,810
And then Neil comes back saying, okay, here it is, right? It's already,

65
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:00,150
it's already, we are right. We should take off the position. So I said, wow,

66
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,310
like I can't believe this just happened. So I told Neil, you know,

67
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,250
take off the trade now and, you know,

68
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,450
post the P and L to the group and explain, you know,

69
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,270
follow up with your video there so that people can learn.

70
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,360
So I got out of my position on that news.

71
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,450
However, Neil had it, Neil was wrong, Neil had a little,

72
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,590
I don't know what happened last night. Maybe he had a late night, long,

73
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,710
a little bit of a bender. But you know, midday, Kyle comes in and says, guys,

74
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,720
you know, November 13th is still bid. It's still above November 20, right?

75
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,020
He's seeing 57 for the November 20 and 56 for the November 13, right?

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,840
There's still, there's still an event being priced into the November 13. Okay.

77
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,500
So, unfortunately I was on my phone at the time I wasn't on,

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,140
I wasn't on a desktop, otherwise I would have checked. You know,

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,800
I took Neil's word for it and close out the position, but that's okay. We got,

80
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,360
we got back into it later on and here's Neil making a joke of it, right?

81
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,580
Saying I never gave the signal.

82
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,910
Okay. So, but you know, we can't be mad at, we can't be mad at him though,

83
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,790
because he was the one who initiated the trade at 70 cents and then we got it off

84
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,130
for, you know, well over, well over a dollar, close to a dollar 40.

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,400
Exactly. Right. Steven, it was Neil's idea. So, you know,

86
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,680
he did make us quite a bit of money. So we can't ding him for that.

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
So what happens? Well, the research starts, right? So we realized that, okay,

88
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,690
November 13th is still bid relative to November 20. We need to make a trade.

89
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,260
Okay. We need to make a trade here.

90
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,110
Something needs to happen because there's a complete inefficiency.

91
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,250
Like Neil's model basically said the chance of this happening is zero. Okay.

92
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,790
And if you guys want to learn about what Neil's model was,

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,970
he did a whole video on it and that's posted on our, on our YouTube.

94
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,360
Basically zero chance that it could happen. So we said, okay,

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
we need to start putting on some size if this is correct,

96
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,460
but why is the market getting this so wrong? So funny enough, guys,

97
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,920
while this was happening,

98
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,840
okay, so hold on before we get there.

99
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:32,290
So what I need to do first was figure out what was the fair value of the non-event

100
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,350
volatility. Okay. What was the fair value for this non-event volatility?

101
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,310
So what I did was I used the QQQ and BABA to try to figure out what should JD vol

102
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,350
be trading at if there was no event, right?

103
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,990
Obviously these are all correlated together.

104
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,270
We can get a sense of what JD vol should be trading at given BABA and NASDAQ don't

105
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,640
have earnings during November 13th, right?

106
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,940
So we're using the new terminal here. And what, so this,

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,580
this graph right here is showing us the NASDAQ vol minus JD vol and the average

108
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,670
is about 18%. Okay.

109
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:17,720
So at the time NASDAQ I vol for the November 13th was trading at 27%.

110
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,500
So we had 18% on that and we get 45%. Okay.

111
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:32,960
So 45% given NASDAQ should be JD vol. Also, BABA I vol was 42%. Okay.

112
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:40,220
And so given that information, right, we also look at the BABA JD spread,

113
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,560
right? Given that information, JD spread,

114
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,170
and we looked at the beta between JD and BABA should be about 46%. Okay.

115
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,350
Given what we just took from BABA and Q's,

116
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,260
the event, the non-event vol should be 45%. Okay.

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,660
That was the information we came up with.

118
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:11,370
Yet the JD non-event vol November 13th at the time was 55% implied volatility.

119
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,270
Okay. So we said, okay, something's up here, but we don't know what.

120
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,750
So we actually, you know, we started to go in very small, very light, right?

121
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,110
We got a couple of diagonals on.

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,580
Now at the time, so this is at 1.33. So at the time I get a message, okay,

123
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,020
from a PM. Well, XPM,

124
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,060
he actually used to be head of the derivative desk at JP Morgan.

125
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,420
And he's saying, what do you think of this,

126
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,760
of this long November straddle short 1.7 Jan straddle for BIIB. Totally,

127
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,920
totally different. Totally different trade. He's like,

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,540
I think that Jan vol is too high relative to no vol. Once, you know,

129
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,580
once this is gone, you know, there should be nothing left after March.

130
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,640
So I said, I'll have a look. But in the meantime,

131
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,340
JD will announce November 13th cycle tomorrow.

132
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,670
The out the money call should drop nine points. This is the research that,

133
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,850
you know, we were working on at the time. And he asked me like,

134
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,710
did investor relations tell you this? Like, how do you know this?

135
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,570
And then he says, Bloomberg has it confirmed as 1113.

136
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,490
So he checks his terminal and he says,

137
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,620
Bloomberg has it confirmed on November 13th. Right. So right off the bat,

138
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,170
I'm thrown for a loop. Right. I was like, I was like,

139
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,110
there's nothing on investor relations. Like why is this happening? Right.

140
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,830
How does Bloomberg have it confirmed? How's,

141
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,260
how the hell does Bloomberg have this confirmed? So I was like, holy shit,

142
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,970
I could be on the wrong side of the trade. Right. I'm selling this thing.

143
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:47,440
It's already confirmed. And so he's, he gave us an idea like, like maybe China,

144
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,380
maybe in China, they don't have to give a date. Right. You know,

145
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,720
who knows what the, what the, what the rules are over there. Right. And if,

146
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
and if that's the case though, so if it was November 13th,

147
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,940
we could come in there and buy a ton, a ton of vol November 13th.

148
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,600
It'd be the best trade. It'd be the best trade ever.

149
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,800
We'd make millions and millions and millions. Billions and billions.

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,300
How does he say it? Millions. You got the hand, the hand gestures down. Okay.

151
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,410
So, um, so I was like, you could buy November. I was like, if that's the case,

152
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,530
you could buy November 13th, sell November 20th, quasi ARB. Right. Um,

153
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,350
I was like, there should be 7% implied move. And then he takes a look at it.

154
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,430
I send him some information. He's like, nice work. So at the bottom here,

155
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,650
I'm going to start selling November 13th. Right.

156
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,490
And buy some obvious earnings in December.

157
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,950
So he's going to also do a calendar spread.

158
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,610
Sell November 13th and buy longer dated options.

159
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,340
Some similar to what we were doing. So here's Bloomberg. Okay.

160
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,530
So here's what he was seeing. So you guys can see right here where it says,

161
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,170
so it says like earning surprise snapshot under measure.

162
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,910
It says next announcement, 11, 13th, 2020, 11, 13,

163
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,090
but it has a C meaning it's confirmed. Right.

164
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,010
Bloomberg usually has an E if it's only an estimate,

165
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,610
but they have it confirmed November 13th. Okay.

166
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,130
So all of a sudden this makes sense, right?

167
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,940
Bloomberg people with millions of dollars who can actually move markets are seeing

168
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,500
that November 13th, this earnings is confirmed. Okay. And you know,

169
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,820
Bloomberg is never wrong. Right. So we must be on the wrong side here.

170
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,020
Bloomberg is going to be right. Right. We, how are we going to go against this?

171
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,820
So our two interns, Neil and Kyle, they start looking into this. Right.

172
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,400
So they started looking into this.

173
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,970
And so Neil comes up with actually a great idea. He says like,

174
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,050
so since JD is a Chinese company,

175
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,320
potentially they have a different website for their investors. And guess what?

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,140
Sure enough, they did. Right.

177
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760
Neil actually goes and finds this on the Hong Kong stock exchange filings.

178
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,120
And I was blown away when he found this. I was like,

179
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,730
you gotta be kidding me here. Right. So he finds this and right at the top,

180
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,210
it says a board meeting. Right.

181
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,050
And we click on it and it's actually have a board meeting on November 13th to discuss

182
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,360
the future earnings. Okay. November 13th,

183
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,420
they have a meeting to discuss the future earnings.

184
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,400
And that is what Bloomberg was actually picking up on.

185
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,340
It wasn't the earnings date. It was a board meeting and they got that mixed up.

186
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:40,730
So big inefficiency on Bloomberg's end. Right. And a lot of markets right now,

187
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,090
a lot of brokerages, a lot of like earnings, whispers, all those guys.

188
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,110
We're starting to pick up on this. That is November 13th,

189
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,790
which is a complete inefficiency. Okay. Complete inefficiency.

190
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,140
Yeah. So Steven, that's, and that's what we thought about, right? We said,

191
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,140
we said, okay, well, this could signal, this could signal some type of like,

192
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,980
some type of all, some type of all right. We can't just go and say,

193
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,780
let's go solve all. Now we've got to learn more.

194
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
We have to understand our edge more. Right.

195
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,560
We have to understand this inefficiency more. There's the market smart.

196
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,280
We can't just go and blindly start doing stuff. So what happens? Well,

197
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,240
we find another day, right? The date of board meeting on August 4th.

198
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:29,260
And this had the exact same scenario. It said on August 4th,

199
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,180
we're going to have earnings. We're going to have a board meeting.

200
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,100
We were going to discuss earnings in the future.

201
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,760
And what happened was actually they confirmed on August 6th,

202
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,100
they came out on August 6th and said,

203
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,570
we're going to have earnings after this date, after this board meeting. Okay.

204
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,690
So this board meeting actually happened on August 14th. So August 4th,

205
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:55,910
they said,

206
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,410
we're going to have a board meeting on August 14th to discuss earnings just like,

207
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,360
just like now. Right. They're saying on November 3rd,

208
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,020
we're going to have a board meeting on November 13th to discuss earnings.

209
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,820
So what, so now we've got to keep going. We've got to keep digging.

210
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:22,290
So what I did was I went back to thinkorswim on August 5th. Okay. August 5th.

211
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,740
So right after they announced, let me go back a slide.

212
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,620
So right after they announced, right, I went back. And what do we see? Well,

213
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,960
we see that vol is still bid, right?

214
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,880
For the August 14th where they're supposed to have their, their board meeting.

215
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,130
Vol is still bid, just the exact same scenario as what we're having right now.

216
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,240
Right. Exactly. The exact same scenario.

217
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,150
But look what happened guys. Once they confirmed the earnings date, August 6th,

218
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,410
look at this vol for the August 14th.

219
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,830
So look at the August 14th guys. Look at the vol. No, let's do this.

220
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,240
Oh, it's this one. It's this one. Okay. Look at the vol here.

221
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,140
Are you going to change it? It goes from, it goes from 53 to 40.

222
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,810
As soon as they confirmed the earnings, the board meeting meant nothing.

223
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,290
Vol vanished.

224
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
Okay. It completely vanished.

225
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,490
And that's what's happening right now.

226
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,170
And that's what's happening right now. Right. So we said, okay,

227
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,650
that's all we need. We completely understand this edge.

228
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,830
We 100% understand this edge.

229
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,960
And literally the exact same scenario happened last quarter.

230
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,610
And it looks like in order to take advantage of this,

231
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,270
we need to start selling November 13th. And we need to do this in size.

232
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,720
We need to do this in size. So we started selling.

233
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,810
So here are my screenshots from today. Okay. So we started selling in size,

234
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,130
right? We've got hundreds of lots on. I mean, oops.

235
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,290
We just kept pounding and pounding and pounding. So I was getting in.

236
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,890
Sean was getting in. Neil was getting in. Kyle was getting in.

237
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,430
We just kept hitting this thing as much as we possibly could. Now,

238
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,130
what happened though? Right. We just, there's no, we can't just like, you know,

239
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,550
you can't just be making free money here. Right. And no one just,

240
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,230
no one notices. You know, it's like, um, uh, it's like the support line,

241
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,950
you know, you can just sell as many as you want at the support line.

242
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,830
You can just, you know, or you can buy as much as you want at the, uh, sorry.

243
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,930
You can buy as much as you want at the resistance line. Right.

244
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,490
The whole technical analysis thing. Like it's infinite fills.

245
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,060
It's not infinite fills. Right. So here, for example,

246
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,660
the market maker started catching on. So towards the end of the day,

247
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,020
the market makers were noticing that all of a sudden, all this, all this,

248
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,030
all these lots were coming into the market. And so they, they,

249
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,620
they took notice of this. Right. And so, unfortunately for me,

250
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,960
I had to pay a little bit of a premium. I, you know, I,

251
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,420
I let the guys get in prior to I did. And then, you know,

252
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,350
unfortunately I had to pay up a little bit and I was just coming in more size to

253
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,490
look at Jordan, the true Robin hood. Yeah. I know the trading world.

254
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,610
I know Sean and I have been the nice guys here and letting you guys look and letting

255
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,610
you guys come in first. Right. So, um, now,

256
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,630
so here we're going to look at some of the data. Okay. So here we go.

257
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,860
What are the guys saying? Stephen's making me laugh.

258
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah. So let's take a look here. Right. So this, this, uh,

259
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,080
this is today's implied volatility for the 90 call option. Okay.

260
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,630
For the November 13th, this is when Neil was sleeping in the red, right.

261
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,110
We could have got some pretty good fills there,

262
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,270
but then this green period is when we started researching and we started researching,

263
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,850
um, you know, what was happening. Right.

264
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,170
And then we started getting fills and you can see guys,

265
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,170
we just started driving that vol down. Right.

266
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,130
We started hitting it and just driving the vol down and the market maker started

267
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,640
adjusting. Right. They said, okay, something's going on here and we need to,

268
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,520
we need to adjust. We need to adjust.

269
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,250
So this is for the, that was November 13th. This is for the November 20.

270
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,970
You can see guys, it stayed bid, right?

271
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,150
The market maker actually wasn't pushing it too far up.

272
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,990
And you know why he wasn't pushing it too far up because it was already pricing

273
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,970
in the move. Right. Because we know it's like, uh,

274
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,590
it's most likely going to be November 13th,

275
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,510
but November 20th for sure has it priced in. Right.

276
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,370
And it was a lot more liquid, right? November 20 is the monthly,

277
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,570
a lot more liquid. So market maker doesn't need to, you know,

278
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,030
doesn't need to get too worried. Right. He's got a lot of options there.

279
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,460
And so we didn't drive up November 22 much, but you can see,

280
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,960
we literally drove, uh, November, uh, that's, that's the nineties.

281
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,200
And look at the, out of the money guys. Okay. We,

282
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,900
we were selling out of the money on the November 13th.

283
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,690
We absolutely crushed it, right? We absolute vol went from 62 to 54.

284
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,360
You made markets more fair, right? We, we, exactly. We provided a service,

285
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,080
right. But you know, this is,

286
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,720
this is a thing where we can't get unlimited fills, but we,

287
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,700
unfortunately we can't get unlimited fills and, you know,

288
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,860
by trading it's expensive, right. And by trading size, you know,

289
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,320
that's why we say there's some capacity constraint ideas.

290
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,460
I can't come in here with $20 million and do this. Right.

291
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,020
So a couple of things though, guys,

292
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,180
there was someone who came in with 550 lots around one 15.

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,260
It's funny that, you know, when I sent my, uh, you know, the guy, the message,

294
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,140
it was just before that, but wonder who it was. Yeah. It's funny that,

295
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,420
you know, someone came in here with some serious, serious size.

296
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,800
And you can see right here, guys, they hit the bid.

297
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,680
So they were willing to sell at the bid. They were being aggressive.

298
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,200
They're saying,

299
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,040
I know for sure that this thing is overpriced and I'm willing to hit that bid.

300
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:32,020
And they did with 550 loss. And I think that also triggered the start.

301
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,520
So if we got in a bit earlier, I think we could have got better fills,

302
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,680
but coming from these big orders. And then,

303
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,200
then I was coming with a hundreds of lots coming in.

304
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,860
It's just like the market can't do it. He just said, Hey, this is it. Yeah.

305
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,790
I might be on the wrong side here. I can't do this.

306
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,590
So, so that is, uh, let's see. I think that's the end of the presentation.

307
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,670
Yeah. So that's it.

308
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:10,000
So there guys is an example of going from start to finish for a trade. Well,

309
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,040
I guess, well, we still have tomorrow.

310
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,140
We still got to take off the position tomorrow.
