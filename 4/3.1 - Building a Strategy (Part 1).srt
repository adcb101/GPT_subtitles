1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,160
All right, guys. So in this, uh, in this video,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,560
we're going to be talking about when basically in this series,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,970
we're going to be talking about building out a strategy.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,770
We're actually going to be building out a strategy from scratch. Right.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,170
And I think this is like one of the things that a lot of the members here have been

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,530
asking me is like, Jordan, I want to trade stuff outside of earnings. Right.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,450
Um, you know, how can I come up with an idea, you know, on all this stuff?

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,590
And I think it's so important,

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,150
so important that we actually build out a strategy together and. You know,

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,950
you guys seeing the process, we'll be able to, to do it on your own. Um, one,

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,330
so one thing I will say is that,

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,690
so this strategy is earnings related only because I want to get into it in a certain,

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,190
a certain aspect. I think there's a lot of money to be made there. Um,

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,490
but the ideas are identical across the board. Okay. Whatever idea you have, um,

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,290
it's going to be the same. And also like throughout, you know,

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,350
in this first quarter, in this first series,

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,010
we're going to be talking about the different types of edges out there. Okay.

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,750
And what like an edge actually looks like. All right.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,320
And one thing I'll mention here as well. Um, when you see an edge,

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,980
when you actually see someone like trade an edge, so let's say for example,

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,520
you go work at a buy side firm and you actually see like your mentor or you're the

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,520
portfolio manager trade out the edge. It's like crucial in your growth.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
Like you actually see, um,

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,500
what it takes to be profitable or what it looks like to be a profitable trader.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,300
Right. And that's so key. So, um, that that's why we're doing this.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,240
I just think it's going to be very insightful for you guys. Okay.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,520
So I'm thinking maybe next time I'm going to put this in PowerPoint,

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,810
but I wrote this down in R in the meantime. Oh, Sean,

29
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:46,090
can you make me host share my screen? Yeah. Okay. So I'll just down in R oops,

30
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,150
but I think I'll, I'll probably put it into a PowerPoint, uh, for next round.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,170
So we're going to go,

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,910
I have a couple of sections here that we're going to go over.

33
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,010
So it's basically these three sections, uh, sorry. Uh,

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,340
we have about six sections to go through.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,200
So the first one that I really want to talk about,

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,180
and this is where it all starts, right. Is idea generation, right?

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,860
This is something that a lot of,

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,960
I find a lot of our members are struggling with and it's,

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,120
it shouldn't be a struggle at all. In fact, this is probably the easiest part.

40
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,480
Okay. The easiest part is idea generation.

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,820
So the way you need to think about it is you want to pick something that you want

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,820
to trade. Okay. So for example, spy returns, pairs, trading ETFs,

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,460
relative value trades, right. If you want to do relative value vol trades, um,

44
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,880
you know, you guys can think of so many. Okay.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,820
So that's the first thing is like, what do I want to trade? Right.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,900
And you guys know all these different types of products.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Maybe you want to trade the VIX, right.

48
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,240
You don't need to think of it in terms of like, Hey,

49
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,340
maybe there's some complex system out there. Like, uh, I don't know.

50
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,130
Arbing synthetics in, in super ultra high frequency space, right?

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,650
You don't need to think about it like that. It's like, what do I want to trade?

52
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,930
Right. At the end of the day,

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,530
there's only a certain amount of products out there that you can trade.

54
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,590
So first thing is what do you want to trade or what do you want to investigate and

55
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,210
keep in mind guys, um,

56
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,270
as you investigate new things and new things will pop up. Okay. So first off,

57
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,040
think about something you want to investigate. Okay. You want to trade, right.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,340
And, uh, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Okay. It just, whatever idea,

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,440
you know, a profitable system is just going to be better than the average guy.

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,940
Okay. So you're just going to be better than the average person out there.

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,340
So keep that in mind. Okay. You don't, you know,

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,700
you don't need to make something. I've been thinking,

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,140
I got to create something that's new and fancy. No,

64
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,980
you got to do something that's simple and that, you know,

65
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,840
it's just better than the current guy making money. Right.

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,220
Think about it as an electrician, the guys out there,

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
a good electrician is making the money.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,500
If you can be better than that electrician,

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,730
then you're going to take the money to always remember that. Um,

70
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,610
and hopefully that's already starting to give you some ideas about where you should

71
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,410
be playing. So, um, the reason why we're doing the earnings, uh,

72
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,510
the earnings for this, uh, you know,

73
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,510
for this series is because there's a lot of retail interest.

74
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,450
It's very hard to model. We're going to talk about that later on today.

75
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,410
And there's likely to be a very interest premium. Okay.

76
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,530
So those three things are why I want to investigate this further and why I think

77
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,190
there's a lot of money here. And also I should mention here, uh,

78
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,010
liquidity and we're going to go over types of edges here. So, uh,

79
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,570
so retail interest,

80
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,200
meaning there's a lot of like people who are not pricing this thing correctly.

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,420
Um, it's hard to model and there's a very interest premium liquidity. There's,

82
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,500
there's some other ideas, but that's why this is a good thing to investigate.

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
We don't know if it's going to make money, but we need to try.

84
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,940
It's an idea and we need to investigate it. So, uh,

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,580
just like in business in general, ideas don't make you any money, right?

86
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,560
You guys know that anyone who's in business knows that you always have that friend

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:03,800
that says,

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,520
I got an idea and he thinks he's gonna make millions of dollars off this idea.

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,180
It's the people that can execute that make money, not an idea. It's just, it's,

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,080
you know, it's, it's Fugazi. Everyone has a brilliant idea,

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,780
but you need to build a moat. You need to be able to execute.

92
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,250
That's what's going to build the business. Okay. So that's idea generation.

93
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,190
Any questions about that? That's the first section.

94
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,370
Is there any questions about that?

95
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,720
So could, uh, could an idea be as simple as like, like, like, uh, I want to,

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,100
uh, trade a short ball strategy. Um, no, no, no. It's gotta be more specific,

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,460
more specific. Like, like here's another idea. Um, so, uh, you don't, and this,

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,420
we're going to talk about this later. You don't ask why you ask whether,

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,250
so here's an example. Does, uh, is implied,

100
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,050
is the implied variance risk premium higher on ETFs than stocks?

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,200
Or here's another idea. Where is the,

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,540
where is the variance risk premium the highest across us equities?

103
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,570
If you just want to say, I want to sell vol that's that's too broad, right?

104
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,930
Where do you want to sell vol? I want to sell.

105
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,380
All you gotta do is just ask a question and then you investigate, right? Um,

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,420
if you,

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,070
let's say you want to do sell vol is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on,

108
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,370
um, financial stocks, a good pairs trade, right?

109
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,130
And then you're going to start to, you know, as you get become a better trader,

110
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,610
you've got to start asking better questions, right? So in this case,

111
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:56,940
what I want to investigate is, um, can I forecast, uh, the straddle PNL, right?

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,270
Can I forecast the earning straddle PNL? Perfect. Yeah. Steve's saying,

113
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,190
you know, it's a good point to ask questions and then, uh, you know,

114
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,390
try to solve for answers. Exactly. That's all it is.

115
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,840
Um, so let's move on to, uh, is there any more questions about that, Sean?

116
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:22,890
All good. Let's talk about, uh, characteristics of a good idea. Okay.

117
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,610
So we're going to be, you know, basically talking about the, you know,

118
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,650
asking those good questions. So,

119
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,200
and this is also like characteristics of a good idea,

120
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,060
but also like the business, right? The moat, like you,

121
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,840
you want to have a good business. So you want to have a good idea, et cetera,

122
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,730
et cetera. So data. Okay. So here's an, an, an edge basically, right? Here's a,

123
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,440
uh, I guess maybe I should say this is characteristics of a good edge. Okay.

124
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,320
I have a good business.

125
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,610
And the first thing is data.

126
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,150
So do you have access to data that others don't write? Imagine, for example,

127
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,370
the number of species in the Marianas trench, uh,

128
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,700
predicted apples move around earnings. Well, no one has that data.

129
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,780
So clearly if you had that data, you'd have more knowledge than everybody else.

130
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,740
And you'd make the most money because you have this piece of data that no one has.

131
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
And, you know, if this,

132
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,220
if the number of fishing in the Marianas trench told you that apple would move 5

133
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,740
% tomorrow, and you're the only guy that has that data, well,

134
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,620
you're going to make the most money, right? So that's, that's a,

135
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,240
that's one idea is you have, you have better data than everyone else. Okay.

136
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,850
And then, you know, this is the,

137
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,110
the huge thing in finance where people are trying to get as much data as they possibly

138
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,880
can. Um, so here's one in earnings, for example, that's really difficult.

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,930
So I found out that the guidance predicts the earnings move the best. Okay.

140
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,910
The guidance revision, the guidance surprise,

141
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,230
it's almost impossible to get guidance data. I haven't seen it.

142
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,190
I haven't seen historical guidance data anywhere.

143
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,450
So if you want to spend the time to manually get it, you know,

144
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,940
that's going to give you a huge, a huge edge. Okay.

145
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,260
That's just an example there, the skillset. So if you're playing in,

146
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,640
let's say a pond with, let's say there's not many teams,

147
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,020
but there's a single individuals and they don't have as good of a skillset to let's

148
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,900
say, pull in data, manipulate the data, transform the data, you know,

149
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,360
have good data science skills. That's an edge that you have.

150
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,240
And that's going to be a good business, right? Um, your network.

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,020
So do you have access to people who can give you good ideas, right? Um,

152
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,620
private equity, for example, we can't get into private equity, you know,

153
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,220
as an individual, sure. There's new things coming up, but you know,

154
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,510
if anyone has watched the movie, uh, too big to fail, right. The guy, uh,

155
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,810
you know, the guy from Goldman Sachs, when they're on the verge of bankruptcy,

156
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,030
first call is Warren Buffett. Hey Warren, can you please give us some money?

157
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,730
And I'll give it to you at like pennies on the dollar. That's huge, right?

158
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,190
Warren has access to people. He's the first call for many people, right?

159
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,370
And this happened with I think it was in Canada for Steve. If you Steve,

160
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,790
you'll probably remember it home equity, home, something home capital.

161
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,830
He was the first call to buy out all the mortgage at a 70% discount.

162
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,070
He made a ton of money right after that. Okay.

163
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,420
So do you have a network specialization? Are you a lawyer?

164
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,620
Can you like figure out mergers and acquisitions better than everyone else?

165
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,420
Right. I don't have any space in that. Are you a doctor?

166
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,200
Do you understand biotech better than everyone else? Right.

167
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,570
Are you specialized in this field? Uh, geography, right. In certain places,

168
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,760
you can't trade certain products. So if you are in a certain geography,

169
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,510
you might have an advantage over someone who's not, um, also that, that,

170
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,010
that also incorporates regulatory issues as well.

171
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,280
So being first, you know, being first is always, uh, you know,

172
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,360
being first to an idea. So that's like, I guess, reinventing the wheel there,

173
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,760
right? You can always do that, reinvent the wheel and make some money,

174
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,100
but that's usually a harder route, uh, liquidity constraints. So, you know,

175
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,110
you using your capital to your advantage, um,

176
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,120
and then higher barriers to entry. So for example,

177
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,920
we can't just go and start a high frequency trading firm or an insurance company,

178
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,660
right? The infrastructure for that is insane. Right.

179
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,580
And so that's a barrier to entry. So it's going to get,

180
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,400
that's going to build your moat. And then another one is risk tolerance, right?

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,240
Do you have a high risk tolerance and you could take certain trades that other people

182
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,030
can't. Okay. So those are, uh, characteristics of good edge,

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,830
good business and how you shouldn't be thinking about, you know,

184
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,230
ideas and things like that. So do you have any questions about that?

185
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,030
I am not seeing any questions right now, but maybe we'll give it a second.

186
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,080
Maybe someone's typing. Yeah. I'm surprised,

187
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,160
but I do think a lot of our members,

188
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,040
there should be at least one thing in this list that started to maybe speak to you

189
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,720
a bit. Exactly. Right. Something in this list, so I know a lot of,

190
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,380
a lot of you like are, you know,

191
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,740
specialized in your careers or live in places where maybe you have some geographic

192
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:24,000
advantage, you know, liquidity, you know, data science skills. Yeah.

193
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,740
Adam's saying risk tolerance. Exactly. Yes, sir.

194
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,340
But it should get the gears turning a bit, you know? Yeah.

195
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,610
I'm not seeing any questions, Jordan. Is this boring, Sean?

196
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,810
You think I'm putting the guys to sleep?

197
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,660
I think everyone here is trying to make money.

198
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,340
I don't think anyone's falling asleep. Okay, good, good, good.

199
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:49,300
We're gonna make some money here. Okay. So, so once we have an idea, okay,

200
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,740
we don't want to ask, we don't want to ask why does this exist? Like, you know,

201
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,060
why is there a variance risk premium?

202
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,150
We don't want to ask that right away because we don't know if it's true.

203
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,140
So we need to ask whether,

204
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,260
and we can't really ask whether without looking at the data, right?

205
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,360
And this is something that I see like so many people fall into.

206
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,920
So many retail traders fall into this. They say,

207
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,920
this sounds like a good idea because of this, this, and this,

208
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,630
I'm going to trade it. But we can't ask why until we ask whether. Okay.

209
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,370
So just always remember that saying.

210
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,580
So what we need to do now is we need to collect the data,

211
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,060
we need to inspect the data. So I went ahead, guys,

212
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,300
and we'll do another series, maybe on like collecting data.

213
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,760
But I basically pulled in everything from the terminal,

214
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
all the data that goes into our terminal and a couple other features.

215
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,290
So let's take a look at it. Okay. So here's our data set.

216
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:51,430
This is the raw data set. Okay. And this is usually how, how it works, right?

217
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,850
How, how, how the process goes.

218
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,380
And just, just remember guys, this is literally how I'm,

219
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,180
how I'm building up this strategy. Okay.

220
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm not just like putting this together. I'm actually trying to build this out.

221
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,060
So we have, we have our tickers. So you can see like AA, like,

222
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,260
and we'll talk about how big this dimension is. We have our tickers, you know,

223
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,390
our earnings date, whether it was after market or before market open, you know,

224
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,480
the price of, you know, the volume. What else we got here? Okay.

225
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,900
We got the average move, the IV30, this IV60, IV90,

226
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,890
realized vol, skew, contango, implied earnings move, et cetera. Okay.

227
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,150
So let's take a little bit, let's keep looking at this data set. So let's,

228
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,970
what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at the dimensions of our data

229
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,150
set, say data set.

230
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,890
So you can see here it's 28,000 rows and 60 columns.

231
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,610
So we have 60 variables and 28,000 rows.

232
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,200
So going back over five years for earnings.

233
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,360
And also let's take a look here if we do.

234
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,700
So we're going to see how many tickers are in this data set. Okay.

235
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,170
So how many different tickers are in our data set here?

236
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,660
So we got 1800 tickers. All right.

237
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,730
Now once we have our data set and we're going to inspect it a little bit more,

238
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,970
of course, but once we have our data set,

239
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,860
we need to think about what are we trading?

240
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,840
And this is called our target variable. Okay. So like we said earlier,

241
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,220
an example of a target variable would be the S&P 500 returns.

242
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,160
What do you guys think? I'm going to put this question on you guys.

243
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,860
What do you guys think our target variable would be here?

244
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
So we want to trade earnings vol. Okay. What would our target variable be?

245
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,360
What would it look like?

246
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,610
What are the guys saying? So the target variables, I think we want to trade.

247
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,660
Nothing yet. Nothing yet. Okay. Give it 10 more seconds.

248
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:29,600
I was watching Ferris Bueller's day off yesterday and the professor, he's like,

249
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,780
anyone, anyone, anyone?

250
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:51,540
I feel like Okay. Robbie, Robbie saying implied move slash average move. Okay.

251
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,580
Yeah. Implied move divided by average move. Okay.

252
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,640
Sebastian saying the difference between implied vol and realized vol.

253
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,580
Crawford saying equities with liquidity. Okay.

254
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,020
I think you're going to talk about that. Yeah. So the real,

255
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,740
the target variable we should have here is our straddle, our straddle price,

256
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,170
right? The straddle price return. So we're actually trading the straddle,

257
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,910
right? We're going to be buying and selling straddles. So in order, you know,

258
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,150
so just like buying and selling the S&P 500,

259
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,070
our target is going to be the return of that. So our straddle P and L,

260
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,100
our straddle return. Okay. That's going to be our target variable. All right.

261
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,840
So let's go back to our dataset here. Maybe just define target variable. Yep.

262
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,560
So target variable guys is the thing that we want to predict. Okay.

263
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,360
It's what we want to predict, what we want to trade.

264
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,060
All right. Do you have any good example, like outside of trading?

265
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,000
Real estate prices.

266
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,180
Whether someone is going to have cancer or not.

267
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,480
The temperature tomorrow. Okay.

268
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,960
The body mass of a person given other variables. Okay. That's what a target is.

269
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,460
And every dataset is going to have one, right?

270
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,360
We got to try to predict something and that's going to be our target.

271
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,090
So straddle return. All right. So let's take a look at our dataset again.

272
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,780
And here I created it. Okay. Well, we have it in the terminal as well.

273
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,350
Okay. So here is our straddle return.

274
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:55,730
So you can see pre-event and let's look at this example here. Okay. Pre-event,

275
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:05,020
the straddle was $2.90. Post-event, it was $3.08. So the return was 5%. Okay.

276
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,690
Now, one thing that's important, guys, is, okay.

277
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,920
So does anyone have any questions about what a target variable is?

278
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,080
Chris made a funny comment here when we were listing off potential target variables.

279
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,790
He's like, a good one would be whether the live will be a good one.

280
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,390
That could be a target for sure. So Kyle asked,

281
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,610
why the straddle P&L instead of the implied move?

282
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,840
Well, are you trying to predict what the implied move is going to be tomorrow?

283
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,750
Or do you mean the actual move?

284
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,030
So I think having the actual move,

285
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,690
why don't we try to predict the actual move tomorrow?

286
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,280
And it's a really good question, Kyle. And maybe we'll do some more,

287
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,260
maybe down in the next series, we'll talk a little bit more about it.

288
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,020
But the reason is because it's hard to predict. So here's another example.

289
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,400
It's hard to predict the score between Chelsea and Manchester United. What? Oh,

290
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,420
sorry. No, no. That was a little too difficult.

291
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,240
It's hard to break the score between West Ham and Manchester United,

292
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,100
but it's easy to predict who's going to win.

293
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,870
So instead of having it as what the actual move is,

294
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:44,580
what we really want to decide is the bias. And in this case,

295
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,140
it would be the straddle P&L tells us that. What is the bias like?

296
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,550
Whether the actual outcome.

297
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:05,190
And also you can't trade the actual move. Or you can trade the straddle P&L.

298
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,790
And the straddle P&L would be equivalent to implied divided by realized.

299
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,920
Now, that being said, though, Kyle, there is a new technique.

300
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,300
I don't want to get into it too much because of this,

301
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,780
but basically decomposition and then recomposition.

302
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,360
But I'm going to stay clear of that.

303
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,880
So that could be something for you down the road if you want to explore.

304
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,820
So first thing we need to do, guys, is we're going to talk about priors now.

305
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,720
So we're going to spend all the rest of our time now on this target variable.

306
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,990
And we're going to talk about candidate variables a little bit later and then in

307
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,910
the next series. But first things first,

308
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,350
we're going to talk about our target variable.

309
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,840
So this is where the highest return on spent time is going to be,

310
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:07,630
is working on your target variable. So we need to start with a prior.

311
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,230
And this is basically going to be from our domain knowledge.

312
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,130
The reason why the engineer can't go,

313
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,210
there's so many people that go to university, get engineer's degrees,

314
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,650
learn about neural networks, learn about AI.

315
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,780
They go and try to figure out trading and they don't make any money.

316
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,960
Or they use an out-of-the-box system and then apply it to trading and they don't

317
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,620
make any money. And the reason is because there's craftsmanship here.

318
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,030
You can't just use out-of-the-box things. As a good data scientist,

319
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,190
you really need to understand your variables.

320
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,470
You really need to understand what the problem you're trying to solve.

321
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,810
You need to have a good domain knowledge.

322
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,490
That's going to make you a good data scientist,

323
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,440
is really learning about the problem at hand. So we need to have a prior.

324
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,430
So let's take a step back. Let's have a little, let's take a little breather.

325
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:12,890
Maybe getting a little too much information flow happening here, but a prior.

326
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,950
A prior is basically what we think about something before we even look at it.

327
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,120
Okay. So when I ask you guys,

328
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,490
straddle P&L. If I were to graph straddle P&L,

329
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,780
if I were to graph the 30-day straddle return for an earnings event,

330
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
what would it look like?

331
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,740
What would it look like? In percents.

332
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,040
Long straddle for an earnings event and after an earnings event.

333
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,020
What would the returns look like? Anyone?

334
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,940
Is each point an event or is it over time?

335
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,960
So the straddle return over the event, that's our target variable. Okay.

336
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,820
Our target variable is,

337
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,920
I want to make sure everyone's clear on this because we're going to be building

338
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,360
on this throughout the sessions.

339
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,980
Does everyone understand what our target variable is?

340
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,330
Let's do another one just to make sure we're on the same page. Okay.

341
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,070
So straddle pre, this straddle is going for $6 and 33 cents.

342
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,310
Tomorrow after the event, it's going for $6 and 53 cents.

343
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:38,160
So our target variable is 3.5%. The straddle return, 3.5%. In this case,

344
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:46,680
it was $5.57 pre-event then $4 post-event. So our target lost 27%. Okay.

345
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,700
The thing we're trying to predict lost 27%.

346
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:04,220
How are we looking? No questions. Did anyone figure out what our prior is?

347
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:20,200
Is that William Anderson Lawrence? No, this is less taken path, I believe.

348
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,880
Got it. Okay. I was calling him Lawrence. I'm alive now. Sorry, buddy. Okay.

349
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,660
So William Henderson saying a normal distribution, hopefully with some skew.

350
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,410
Okay. Does anyone disagree with William, aka Lawrence?

351
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,110
Does anyone disagree with him? Steve, do you disagree with that or no?

352
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,370
So it's not going to be normal distribution skew.

353
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,630
He's saying a skewed distribution. Do you agree with that or no? No. Okay.

354
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,250
What do you think it would look like, Steve?

355
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,040
Does anyone else want to take a guess at it? So far, William's the only answer.

356
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,300
So we'll say it's the best answer. It's going to be a skewed distribution.

357
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah. Steve is sweating hard, man. He's really sweating.

358
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,230
Yeah. Ned, please don't answer this or Jeka as well,

359
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,170
since we've talked about this.

360
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,960
Okay. Distribution will mostly be down slightly with some blowouts.

361
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,980
So I think we're still saying a skewed distribution.

362
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,380
What would we think the highest number would be?

363
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,360
And what would the lowest number be on this distribution?

364
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,680
Kyle, what do you think? What do you think in here, buddy?

365
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,660
And if anyone's confused, let me know. We can take a step back.

366
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,140
This is important. We're building the foundation of the series here.

367
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,060
I'm just going to give it a second here, Sean,

368
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,300
but hopefully we get some ideas popping off here. Yeah.

369
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,270
Okay. So how can we, so coin saying,

370
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,350
how can we know something before you explain what a prior is?

371
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,750
So our prior is just what we think this variable should look like from our experience

372
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:47,950
as traders, right? So, okay. So in Toronto right now, it's, what is it, Sean?

373
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,340
24? So knowing that we're moving in Toronto for all these years, it's June,

374
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,100
it's the end of May, it's 24 degrees today.

375
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,700
What would the highest day look like tomorrow?

376
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,860
What would the lowest day look like tomorrow? So Sean,

377
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,320
if I asked you that question, tomorrow's distribution.

378
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,140
So probably 24 is the high end. And what would be the low end?

379
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,710
Like 15. Okay. So come on, it could be higher than 24. The highest highest?

380
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:21,950
In May? Oh, maybe like 32, like back in like 1980 or something. Okay. Perfect.

381
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,690
So tomorrow would be anywhere between 32 and 19. And how did you get that,

382
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,140
Sean? By living in Canada. By living in Canada.

383
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,340
So knowing that we've known about earnings and knowing about vol trading,

384
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,470
because we're vol traders, and this is important guys,

385
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:40,370
because when we look at the data and it's not like this, if we don't know this,

386
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,470
we need to be able to say like, will this look normal or not?

387
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,170
Like if we don't know what an assumption would be, we're kind of lost.

388
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,570
And I'm going to show you once we decide on this.

389
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,440
So we've got a couple answers rolling in here.

390
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,860
Robbie's saying the highest is one, the lowest can be less than negative one.

391
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,480
Yeah. So we're talking long straddle here, guys.

392
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,820
So you guys are saying the highest is going to be a hundred percent gainer.

393
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,560
Kyle's saying some big blowouts, but mostly wins,

394
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,640
never making a hundred percent. Okay. So Kyle, think about the long straddle.

395
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,790
Long straddle we're talking about. Okay. Thank you, Stephen.

396
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,570
So five standard deviation returns. So we're talking in percents. So Steve,

397
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,690
you're going to say about 500 to 600% is on the high end, on the low end,

398
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,550
what do we got?

399
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,050
Negative a hundred. Thank you. Thank you, coins. Perfect.

400
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,980
So now we have a distribution where negative one is going to be the lowest end and

401
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,440
positive 600 is going to be the highest end. Okay. That's where our prior is.

402
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,860
And I agree with that perfectly.

403
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,180
So what we're going to do now is we're going to graph the data.

404
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,130
Now here's what distribution looks like. Okay. We clearly have some, you know,

405
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,570
at five and we have some at like negative three. Now,

406
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,770
if we didn't have a prior or we didn't have any domain knowledge, we might say,

407
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,200
Hey, this is okay. This is okay. Right.

408
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,270
And I actually cut off the tail earlier. This was all the way to 19. Okay.

409
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,690
This right side tail all the way to 19. And we do a summary. Okay.

410
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,010
We can see the min, the smallest number is negative 400%.

411
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,270
How can a straddle lose 400%, right? And the highest number here,

412
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,930
I cut this out. I shouldn't have, it was all the way up to 19 guys,

413
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,790
but the highest we have here is five.

414
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,550
So clearly we need to cut out everything below negative one.

415
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,280
I guess, Steve, but 19, no, it would never be 19. That's a 1900% premium.

416
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,520
Or I guess maybe actually Steve, but no, no, I think 19 is way too much.

417
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,980
19 is way too much, Steve. So what I did was I said, okay,

418
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:09,740
well let's basically use our priors, right? After looking at the data,

419
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,850
negative, negative one to 600. And that's what I did right here. Okay.

420
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,830
And now we actually have our target variable. Okay.

421
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,580
At least the beginning of it. So this is what it looks like guys.

422
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,380
And we can do our summary.

423
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,140
So let's actually learn a little bit about our target variable.

424
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,520
This is the important thing, right? Is actually understanding our data.

425
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
If we're not doing this, we're way behind. We're way,

426
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,200
way behind because someone that has domain knowledge is going to be able to come

427
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,140
up with new ideas.

428
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,930
And this is going to become extremely important when we get into pooling and candidate

429
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,000
variables and all that stuff. So let's learn a little bit about our data.

430
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,510
Okay. Something I did here guys, by the way,

431
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,830
is I took out the most illiquid names as well. So just like some liquidity,

432
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,750
just because with option data, you guys know how it is. It can get messy.

433
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:16,550
So I took out, I put some liquidity in there and yeah. Okay.

434
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,970
So let's learn a little bit about our data here.

435
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,420
Prior. What do we think mean outcome is? Mean outcome of Strata.

436
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,300
What's our prior on that?

437
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,940
Do you want to define prior again?

438
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,300
Yep. Our prior is what is our, from our domain knowledge?

439
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,190
What do we think before we look at anything, right?

440
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,990
Prior to looking at the data, what do we think it would be?

441
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,360
So if I calculate the mean of all the returns prior to looking at the data,

442
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,480
what would it be?

443
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,350
Yeah. You're saying zero or negative 0.1. Awesome. Awesome. Okay.

444
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,630
You guys are getting very close. So Kyle had a really good point there.

445
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,030
He said,

446
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:20,010
does the data below negative one make you worried about the integrity of the data?

447
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,780
Since it doesn't make any sense. So that's a really good point, Kyle.

448
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,960
And you're all in any data set you get, you're always going to have outliers.

449
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,860
You're always going to have something that went wrong. Okay.

450
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,520
So if we actually looked at this data, Kyle, negative 4.23, it was only,

451
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,220
it was only one variable below negative one, and it was this one right here.

452
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,200
So that gives us a good indication that, okay, you know, this was an outlier.

453
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,920
Okay. But yeah. So what I actually did was I looked at Apple.

454
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,720
I looked at a few names and I looked at the data. I actually looked at,

455
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,980
I went back on thinkorswim. I looked at the data on think back and said, okay,

456
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,880
you know, was this, are we getting the same data here? And the answer was yes.

457
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,200
So, but you need to make sure you actually have good data.

458
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,220
So that's a really good point, Kyle. If there was,

459
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,300
let's say a ton of variables below negative one or a ton of outcomes below negative

460
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,580
one, we've got a serious issue, right?

461
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,680
But we have 28,000 rows and we have one variable that's out,

462
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,940
that's below negative one or even below negative 0.8. So I was like,

463
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,540
this is definitely, it's okay. All right. So given our prior,

464
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,840
we would think that selling vol around earnings or buying vol around earnings is

465
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,480
going to be a net loser, right? That was our prior. So let's take a look.

466
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,830
And here it is. So blindly selling vol, okay. But blindly selling the straddle,

467
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:52,030
we're going to, we're going to net negative 0.2% after transaction costs.

468
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,760
So selling vol should net 2% after transaction costs, sorry,

469
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,840
before transaction costs. So that's another thing to keep in mind, right?

470
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,260
In execution, all that stuff, slippage is going to be negative 0.2.

471
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,300
So this is what we're trying to beat. Okay. This is what we're trying to beat.

472
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,780
This is like buying the S&P 500.

473
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,700
We're trying to get this number up as high as possible.

474
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,460
And if it can't get any higher than 0.023 during the course of this, you know,

475
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,460
the series, then we failed, right? Then we clearly haven't,

476
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,980
we clearly aren't better than the current guy.

477
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,770
And I actually want to take a step back here, guys.

478
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,350
I know this is a lot of information here,

479
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,830
but I want to take a step back here and really focus on our target variable here.

480
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,590
The straddle P&L means it's the best guess of the market, right?

481
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,710
This is the market's guess, right? The market saying, here's the implied,

482
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,890
here's the average. That's going to make, you know,

483
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,100
basically our straddle return. And, you know,

484
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,520
we can clearly see here that the market is a really good predictor of the earnings

485
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,060
move. They only get it off by 2%.

486
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,210
And that's usually because there's a variance risk premium. Okay.

487
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,950
So the market does a really good job, right?

488
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,680
This imagine this was negative 10%, right?

489
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,300
That would basically mean the market has no clue how to value vol,

490
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,040
but it's only negative 2%. So,

491
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,800
and we know the market's efficient plus or minus some variance risk premium.

492
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,270
Yeah. So Sebastian's saying, I don't get, it's not zero.

493
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,910
So basically what this is telling us, Sebastian, is that on average,

494
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,280
earnings moves, earning implied moves are slightly overpriced.

495
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,660
Volatility is slightly overpriced. And this makes sense.

496
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,680
So it's not, it's not an ARB, right? If it was an ARB, you couldn't,

497
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,400
you couldn't lose money.

498
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,600
But what this does mean is that if you sell vol in the long run, on average,

499
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,460
you're going to make money,

500
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:07,970
but you're going to have to deal with losing a 600% on a straddle. Okay.

501
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,510
Remember some of these straddles made 500%.

502
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,100
So imagine you sell a straddle for 10, for $10, you sell one lot.

503
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,700
So you sell $10 and you buy it back. So that's 1000 bucks.

504
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,790
And tomorrow you buy it back for six grand. Those are going to happen. Right.

505
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,010
And because of that happens,

506
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,030
there's some risk premium and we can see that right here. So,

507
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,550
so far everything's making sense.

508
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,800
Yeah. So everything's making sense.

509
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,480
The market is very efficient on predicting the straddle return.

510
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:44,360
So what this is saying is that if we sell a straddle for $10, AKA 1000, okay.

511
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:53,080
On average, the next day, we're going to buy this back for 90.98. Okay.

512
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,440
So if we sell a straddle for 1000, on average,

513
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,650
we're going to buy it back for $980 tomorrow. Or if we buy it for 1000,

514
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,550
on average, we're going to sell it back the next day for $980.

515
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,910
Okay. Does everyone get that? Let's take a look at the median.

516
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,630
What do you guys think the median number is going to be?

517
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,800
What do you guys think the median number here is going to be? Kyle,

518
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,050
what do you think it's going to be here, our median outcome of our target?

519
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,920
Three, positive, negative. What are we guessing? So coin saying 2.5%,

520
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,080
Crawford saying 3%. Are we talking plus, minus? What else?

521
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,720
What do you guys think?

522
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,370
Robby, love it. Love Robby's answer. Kyle, perfect. Perfect.

523
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,770
Because remember guys,

524
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,670
the mean is going to be skewed by these like huge numbers,

525
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,690
by these huge numbers, five, 600%.

526
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,710
The median is going to be the most frequent outcome, right?

527
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,810
And a characteristic we know about volatility as a prior, right?

528
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:20,730
Because we're vol traders is that you're going to have a lot of small winners and

529
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,500
a few large losers. So the median should be much bigger. So let's take a look.

530
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,120
And there it is, right? Almost negative 8%. So almost four times higher.

531
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:40,730
Okay. So that is that. And we took a look at our summary.

532
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,650
Let's look at it one more time.

533
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:49,330
Let's look at our summary one more time. And I guess what time is it here?

534
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,440
Okay. We're going to continue more in our next series,

535
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,900
but we'll go over candidate variables super quick, ending this off.

536
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,140
Okay. So let's take a look at our thing here. Our min is 75%.

537
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,340
That's our best winner, our worst loser. And we're talking long straddle here.

538
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,480
The worst loser is when we bought it for $10 and we sold the next day for 75 cents.

539
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,670
Okay. Or sorry, $2.50. And our best winner was we bought it for 10 bucks.

540
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,250
We sold it the next day for 50 bucks or $60. Okay.

541
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,050
So that's our candidate variable. That's our target variable.

542
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,850
And we're going to go into a lot more detail about this, because look at this,

543
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,590
guys. We need to break this down. There's grouping here. There's groups.

544
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,570
Look at this structure. There's humps, right? We've got to get rid of those.

545
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,600
We've got to figure it out. So that's going to be in our next slide.

546
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,400
We're going to really dive deep into our target variable.

547
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,610
But before we do that, we need to understand what a candidate variable is.

548
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,540
And then we're going to end tonight's slide. But this is important.

549
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,540
Target variables, candidate variables.

550
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,660
These are the variables we use to predict our target.

551
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,070
Our target is the weather tomorrow.

552
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:29,770
One of our candidate variables are going to be temperature yesterday,

553
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,120
month of the year, day of the month,

554
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,560
whatever. Together, let's brainstorm an idea.

555
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,160
Who wants to come up with a target variable?

556
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,000
And then we'll come up with some candidates.

557
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,180
Who's got some ideas here? Let's think of a target.

558
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,100
Who wants to talk about a target variable? Or Sean,

559
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,340
do you have an idea of a target variable?

560
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,400
And then we'll have the guys guess some candidates.

561
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,240
Let's do a straightforward one. Tomorrow's weather. Come on.

562
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,500
I did tomorrow's weather already.

563
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,660
Starting salaries out of university. Awesome. Awesome.

564
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,700
Starting salaries.

565
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,960
Why don't we just say salaries at 25? Salaries at 25. Okay. That's a good one.

566
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,260
Salaries at 25.

567
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,350
Degree experience. These are things I'm seeing so far. Location. Location.

568
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,410
Coins. That's actually going to be one of our targets.

569
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,470
It's going to be the actual value. That's our target variable.

570
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,460
We've got to be our candidates now. Experience, education, cost of living.

571
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,920
Love it. Let's look at a couple more here. Some unique ones. Field. Yes.

572
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,870
University attended. Net worth of parents. I love it.

573
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:09,050
Maybe a cool one could maybe be the median income from the area they live in.

574
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,770
Exactly. Here's a really unique one as well. John Doe said smooth talker.

575
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,100
He's saying if the person is a smooth talker or not.

576
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,640
What you would do is you have a candidate variable that was either a one or a zero.

577
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,460
If it was one, it means they're a smooth talker. If it's a zero,

578
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,820
it means they're not a smooth talker.

579
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,030
That would be an example of a candidate variable.

580
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:43,820
They can come in different styles. It could be a factor. What state they're in.

581
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:54,590
Florida. Ohio. Pennsylvania. Whatever. Then you could have numeric variables.

582
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,360
The numeric variables can be of different types.

583
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,480
They could be discrete or continuous.

584
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,940
Example of a discrete variable would be the number of goals scored in a game.

585
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,260
A continuous variable would be the amount of rainfall.

586
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,480
You have all these different candidate variables.

587
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,860
They come in different styles, different flavors.

588
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,220
These are going to help you predict the target.

589
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,120
They're going to help you predict the target.

590
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,830
Let's take a look back at our data set.

591
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,770
We're always going to be going back to our data set, always exploring.

592
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,560
I want to ask you guys a question. Here's our data set.

593
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:40,800
We know what our target is. It's the straddle P&L. Before I even look at that,

594
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,740
what do you guys think would be good candidate variables?

595
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:57,100
Market cap. Cool. Like it. What else? Event vol. Love it.

596
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,820
Average historical move. Past P&L. Hell yeah. These are good.

597
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,400
These are all ideas of candidate variables. Now,

598
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,740
a lot of times they actually won't predict. If they can predict,

599
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,780
then you're going to make a ton of money. A lot of times they can't predict.

600
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,280
Or they're already incorporated into the straddle P&L.

601
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,100
They're already incorporated into the implied move. Let's say, for example,

602
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,500
market cap was a really good predictor of tomorrow's move.

603
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,760
This is a key essential piece here, guys, when we're trading. Because remember,

604
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,020
it's a competition. If market cap was a good predictor of tomorrow's P&L,

605
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,740
everyone can see the market cap,

606
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,660
and they would change the implied move based on the market cap.

607
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,490
That's going to be incorporated into our straddle P&L. Remember,

608
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,050
our target variable is the market's best predictor.

609
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,700
We're trying to be better than that. All right. Maybe a way to think about it.

610
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,140
I'm going to say, just to add on there, make it really clear.

611
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,000
Remember at the start, you gave that example about the electrician.

612
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,220
There is an electrician there right now working on this problem.

613
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,420
Somebody's pricing this. They have factors they look at.

614
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,540
They have things they consider.

615
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,900
The blatant ones that are the super good predictors probably are incorporated into

616
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,990
what we're already seeing. We need to get a little bit more creative. Margin,

617
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:33,950
that's another reason why we don't want to use the actual return tomorrow as our

618
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,830
target variable. Because, for example,

619
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,430
we might see market cap is a good predictor of the move tomorrow,

620
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,980
but it's already being priced into the straddle P&L.

621
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,840
It's already tomorrow.

622
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,020
We're going to jump into predictors and also creating predictors,

623
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,980
creating these candidate variables. Just a quick example, guys,

624
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,500
of how you create a predictor or a candidate.

625
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,900
We have implied move and we have average move.

626
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,240
I created this new variable called implied average,

627
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,700
which is the implied divided by the average.

628
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,770
I created this new variable called dollar volume.

629
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,900
Price of the stock times the volume. You create all these things.

630
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,980
Then we're going to start together as a team. It's going to help me.

631
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,780
It's going to help you guys out.

632
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,840
We're going to create a whole bunch of variables that we think are good.

633
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:33,940
We're going to test them.

634
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,300
We're going to try to build up this model step by step.

635
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,560
It's going to be really in-depth.

636
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,280
We're going to go all the way from start to finish with this thing. Jordan,

637
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,600
before we wrap it up here, do you want to quickly give a recap of what we did?

638
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,700
Yeah. Quick recap, guys. Then John, when we get to that question,

639
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:56,260
I love that question. Quick recap. We talked about idea generation,

640
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,570
characteristics of a good business. We talked about target variables,

641
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,830
collecting data, and then candidate variables.

642
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,990
That is the start to our session, our series.

643
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,790
John's question was,

644
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:19,390
how likely is it that we would find a better predictor or a better indicator than

645
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,550
hedge funds that actually hire people full-time to work on these models? Yes,

646
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,570
100%. Let's go back to our characteristics of a good business.

647
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:38,940
One thing is going to be here, liquidity. Understanding where you sit,

648
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,000
which table you should be playing at. If you have $100,000 account,

649
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:49,420
you should never, ever be trading the S&P 500. You should never,

650
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,080
ever be trading Apple,

651
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,690
unless you're trading the balls and there's some mispricing happening there.

652
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:04,870
I traded Apple when all the retail jumped in and pushed it way past where it should

653
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:10,830
be. You are competing against the best guys. There's lots of liquidity.

654
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,070
If I have a $5 billion hedge fund,

655
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,030
and I have some of the best analysts on the street,

656
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:21,980
I can go and trade ball there. Why would I want to compete with them?

657
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:29,950
Just the first thing is compete where you think you're going to make money.

658
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,790
Earnings is not crazy liquid. It's not crazy liquid.

659
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,630
It's also extremely hard to model.

660
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:43,000
Something you'll actually note is a lot of these big hedge funds that hire top talent,

661
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:47,070
the top talent is actually not as smart as you think it is.

662
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,410
It's actually not as smart as you think it is.

663
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,830
If you look at a lot of the guys in the industry on the sell side,

664
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,850
it's all about providing customers ship products. Sorry, my apologies.

665
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,390
It's not providing customers ship products,

666
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,040
it's providing customers products and then hedging for cheaper.

667
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,970
That's literally the whole finance industry.

668
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:14,710
How can I sell you something and then replicate it for cheaper?

669
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:22,200
Think about insurance or think about... Actually, here's a really good one.

670
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,040
A PPN, Principal Protected Note. What is that? Well, it's just a call option.

671
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,330
The bank is going to sell you a principal protected note,

672
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,110
package it up like that, and then recreate it on their end.

673
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,290
They're going to have all this principal protected notes,

674
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:42,950
offset the risk by going into the vanillas and buying, let's say,

675
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,930
a call option. That's 95% of finance.

676
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:50,070
We're talking about the buy side hedge fund. They're usually not in this space.

677
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:54,950
They're usually not looking at this stuff. And when you go down the tiers,

678
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,930
the smaller the size, they're usually not as sophisticated as you get big.

679
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,450
As you make money, you grow and grow and grow.

680
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:11,170
That's why the bigger the hedge fund, usually the more sophisticated,

681
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:15,470
eventually their alpha starts to deplete. But you want to find areas,

682
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,730
long story short, you want to find areas where you can go, where not everyone,

683
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:22,890
where you're better than the majority. You don't need to be the best.

684
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:27,810
So you can compete against these guys as long as we go back up here.

685
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,910
Why do we want to trade this? Because there's a lot of retail traders.

686
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,330
A lot of retail trade earnings. And so for that reason,

687
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:39,370
if I'm better than most retail, I should be able to make money. Okay.

688
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,510
So keep that in mind. You don't need to be the best.

689
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,630
You just got to be better than most. John saying,

690
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:50,450
just to clarify that what we're implying is play a field that's of our size.

691
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,190
Example, find smaller cap companies that hedge funds wouldn't bother with.

692
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,220
Right. And even then you don't always have to be,

693
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,670
remember a hedge fund only has certain capacity. Look what happened to GME.

694
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:10,520
Okay. Everybody, everybody knew GME was overpriced at 400. Everybody.

695
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,360
I don't know one person that said, this is probably, this is very priced,

696
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,500
but it got, or sorry, even at 200 or 100, it was overpriced,

697
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,470
but it got to 400 because there's not infinite selling liquidity, right?

698
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,070
If there's too much demand,

699
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,130
it's going to drive price past where it shouldn't be.

700
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:35,230
So you just basically want to look for where might there be an imbalance between

701
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,030
supply and demand. And then you want to trade in that, you know,

702
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,590
you want to be part of that, you know, part of that place.

703
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,730
Yeah. Jared, that's a really good point.

704
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:51,130
Jared saying like there might be no liquidity, it's too niche. So you,

705
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,970
you know, you really got to make that, you gotta make that judgment call,

706
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,230
right? Where do you want to trade?

707
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,660
And is there enough liquidity for you to trade? That's what's important.

708
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,340
Okay.

709
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:11,910
Okay. That will be the end of this first session in the strategy series,

710
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:16,660
Jordan. I think that was super cool. Next week will be the next session.

711
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,220
So we'll be on Wednesdays next week, right? So moving forward,

712
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,480
these sessions will be held on a Wednesday.

713
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,380
Thank you everyone for your patience. We needed that extra day.

714
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,400
I hope it was worth it. Jared's got a good question here. Jared,

715
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,500
do you just mind elaborating a little bit more in this case of earnings though,

716
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,040
aren't we choosing red or black?

717
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,070
Do you just mind elaborating a little bit more there, Jared?

718
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,180
Right. We're just going to be going either short vol or long vol.

719
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,740
What we're trying to do, is basically say, at the end of this,

720
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:01,360
we're basically trying to say, okay, these factors predict straddle P&L.

721
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,200
If we can get that, and it's going to be very small,

722
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,580
we're going to have a very small edge. But if we can find at the end of this,

723
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,640
let's say,

724
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,900
get that number from negative two to let's say negative five or negative six,

725
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,620
that's humongous. And so that's what we're trying to do there.

726
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,310
Can we check the stock price chart? Yeah, definitely.

727
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,660
And we're going to talk more about pooling and stuff later. So Steve.

728
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,710
So we have like, let's get the summary here.

729
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,920
So third quantile is three and a half percent move. First quantile,

730
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,720
negative three and a half percent move.

731
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,950
Usually it's like close to zero on average.

732
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,410
And the max is 120 and the min is negative 67.

733
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,110
Hold on, Jared. I'm a little confused there.

734
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,410
You're saying like columns related to competition. In the case of earnings,

735
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:46,750
it's less important because we're really just picking a side.

736
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,230
So in this case, Jared, we're really trying to say like,

737
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:59,510
these factors tell us that there's going to be,

738
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,930
that there's a supply demand balance on one side or the other.

739
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:11,170
So these five factors will say that usually the straddle P&L is overpriced or the

740
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,350
straddle implied move is overpriced,

741
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,070
meaning that there's too much buying and not enough selling.

742
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,360
And then on the low end of these five factors,

743
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,960
it means there's not enough buying and there's usually too much selling.

744
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,940
So we might find out, for example,

745
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:34,920
that certain characteristics show us that vol is underpriced.

746
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,460
And that might be because people love selling calls before an earnings event.

747
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,180
Around these particular, let's say dividend stocks. I don't know what it is,

748
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,300
but that's the thing. I don't know.

749
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,280
So we're going to have to find out together. And that's the fun of it.

750
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:58,410
All right, guys, let's wrap up this live. Fantastic stuff, Jordan. Good stuff,

751
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,770
guys. Good stuff. We're going to build it out.
