1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,890
So, on tonight's live, everyone,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,110
we wanted to just have more of an open discussion.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,270
The reason is the big thing we're going to focus on this week is Coinbase,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,710
right? Coinbase, super hype company, right?

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,810
Really difficult to actually like evaluate because it's hard to actually find something

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,550
to compare it to. And it's coming out with the options tomorrow.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,230
So what we wanted to discuss with you is some of the ideas that we're going to be

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,870
looking at first thing in the morning tomorrow for pricing out Coinbase volatility

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,320
and trying to actually,

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,270
if there's a trade, right?

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,590
There's a chance this thing can open up really crazy levels of vol.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,440
And we just want to make sure that, you know,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,640
we have an idea of what we're looking at so we can, you know,

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,730
pull trigger if need be.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,620
What do you think, Jordan?

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,900
So, guys, tomorrow,

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,420
Coinbase coming out with vol products or vol products coming out on Coinbase,

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,540
I should say. And we want to be the first ones there, right?

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,020
We want to be the first ones being able to value this product.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,460
I was asking around some pretty smart people who are in the industry and asked them

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,440
like, how are you going to value this? And they said,

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,160
it's going to be tough because there's no comparables, right?

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,820
There's nothing that's comparable. So, you know,

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
Sean and I were chatting and we were thinking about some ideas on how we could value

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,740
this thing. And we thought, you know, as a team, we would try to figure it out.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
If we can be the first ones to value this thing properly tomorrow, well,

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,520
you know, there's going to be a lot of money on the table, right? So,

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,180
I think it's good that we have this discussion today. So,

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,220
why don't we kick it off with some of our ideas to start, Jordan? Yeah. So,

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,740
the first thing I was thinking was like, okay, well, there's no comparables,

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,800
but can we take a blend of some stuff to try and value this, right? So,

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,710
the ones that I were thinking of right off the bat were Ethereum and Bitcoin vol.

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,890
And then also make, but, you know,

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,330
because it's a company also taking maybe some Tesla vol and GME vol and making a

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,490
blend. And Sean had a- Oh, sorry, dude, I muted you accidentally.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,740
There we go.

37
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,730
No, no, I just muted you accidentally because someone came in with some noise.

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Here, just unmute yourself.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,540
Just now, right? Yeah, my apologies. No, no problem. So,

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
Steve B still heard me say happy birthday to him.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,420
And he heard me saying happy birthday, right? All right. Yeah, guys,

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,640
just so you know, keep your mics on mute. Just until like, you know,

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,700
unless you have something just for background noise, things like that.

44
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,540
All right. So, yeah, Coinbase.

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,360
We try to take a blend to try to figure out what the vols are there. And so,

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,630
GME, Tesla, and Bitcoin and Ethereum vol.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,920
But Sean also had a really good point there. Well, what about a brokerage,

48
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,660
right? Isn't this thing, isn't this thing like a brokerage? And so, you know,

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:25,340
we said, okay, well, maybe it's obviously not going to be as- What's that?

50
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,630
What's IBKR vol? IBKR vol is like 25. Yeah,

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,880
so it's probably not going to be that. Right. Oh,

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,500
Marcos is saying there might be a couple of comparables like FUTU and TIGR.

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,760
Yeah? What are these? What are these, Marcos?

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,740
Do you want to chat? Like, what's going on? Well, like,

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,190
what are these products? I think those are like Chinese digital brokerages.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,890
Chinese digital brokerage. Interesting. That could be close.

57
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,260
That could be good. That could be really good. Digitized? Not like,

58
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,260
I don't think those are like crypto brokerage. Yeah,

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,600
these are probably going to be, I would say, more volatile than Coinbase.

60
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,100
What was the other one, Marcos, you said? TIGR. TIGR?

61
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,930
Yeah, because, so one of the things I was thinking, right? You know,

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,110
we could use like Bitcoin vol, for example,

63
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,130
but, you know, are their revenues really tied to the value of Bitcoin?

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,720
You know, like, you know,

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,680
I'm trying to think of what would be on like interactive brokerage because they

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,020
make their money off of commissions, right? You know, do we know,

67
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,340
are they taking the Bitcoin and investing it somewhere?

68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,540
Or do they just hold it for their clients? Like, you know,

69
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,930
where are they really making their money? Yeah. Yeah,

70
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,690
it'll impact buying and selling for sure. But that's more like,

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
it's not like Bitcoin goes from $100,000 to $50,000,

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,740
their revenues are cut in half. It's not a one-to-one relationship like that.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,380
Because maybe, like, do we know, does a dip in Bitcoin encourage more buying?

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,240
Do people just, you know, like,

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,150
on a surface level, it's like that's not their revenue, you know? Or is it?

76
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,330
I don't know a ton about them.

77
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,980
I think their earnings are going to be a lot more volatile than let's say a lot

78
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,900
of the competitor or like a lot of like, you know, regular brokerages.

79
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,960
And you have that retail hump, right? The retail pump.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,420
Which is why I was thinking we put in GME as kind of like in the mix as well.

81
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,340
GME vols.

82
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,430
But this is going to be a tricky one. I was looking,

83
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,370
so the ones that Marcos mentioned are trading at about $100 vol.

84
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,330
Futu and Tiger are trading at about $100 volatility.

85
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,880
There's one to check out here as well. It's a Canadian company, VYGR.

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,660
It's a crypto exchange listed on the TSX. Really? That's what I'm seeing here.

87
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,030
These things went to the, this thing went to the moon. Okay,

88
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,410
but realized vols are only $35.

89
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,450
Because one thing we're seeing with Coinbase right now is, I'm sorry, guys.

90
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,410
Does anyone know actually? Oh, there it is.

91
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,960
The last two days, guys, it's been moving 3%,

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,860
right? So when vols come out, I would imagine this thing picks up a little bit.

93
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,640
You know, like, what if this thing actually realizes $50 vol or $40 vol,

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,230
right?

95
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,630
If I look at Tesla, for example,

96
00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:00,090
so Tesla is trading at $58 realized vol right now. $70 implied. Okay,

97
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,350
we got GME realizing $100 vol.

98
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,020
And the one that Sean mentioned is realizing $35 vol. And IBKR, TD, Ameritrade,

99
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
they're all realizing $20 vol.

100
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,220
So Koa is raising his hand here. So I would say like anything above $80 vol,

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
guys, is probably a sell.

102
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,580
And we're going to be trading the longer dated vols.

103
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,600
That's what's going to be probably most overpriced is the longer dated vol.

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,780
And, you know, the GAMLA is probably going to be fairly priced.

105
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,830
It's that longer dated vol that's going to be over underpriced. So,

106
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,620
Micah had an idea. Eric, Micah, a few people have had ideas here. Actually,

107
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,640
lots of ideas in the chat.

108
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,520
So I'll start with Micah's idea here. He said,

109
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,420
what if we start by setting an upper bound on vol? Right?

110
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,180
Coinbase isn't more likely to be,

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,660
isn't likely to be more volatile than their first two to three days after their

112
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,660
IPO anyways. Really good point, actually. Really good point, Micah.

113
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:16,280
And the only issue is the first day was like 300 vol. Right?

114
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,460
But if we look after that, Micah, and that's a really good point, actually.

115
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,810
This range here.

116
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,070
It's only a 6% range. So I think, honestly,

117
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,370
I think that's actually a really good way to look at it, buddy.

118
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,320
Let's just do the math super quick. So I'd say upper bound, 96 vol.

119
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,840
Wow.

120
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,040
Watch this thing come out at 120 vol tomorrow. Like the one year.

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,920
I know Steve B saying the shorter-dated vol is going to be overpriced.

122
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,960
I actually, I would disagree with that, Steve.

123
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,040
And I'd love to hear your opinion.

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,860
Gamma is probably not going to be too expensive. Right? Like this thing,

125
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,280
this thing could get pumped so easily. And I think that the longer-dated vols,

126
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,440
man, are going to be through the roof.

127
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,740
They're going to come down like 40 vegas on a two-year option. You know,

128
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,650
in a week. Just like ARKX did.

129
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,390
Not 40 vegas, but 10 vegas. Koa has his hand up.

130
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,290
Maybe we'll see what Koa has to say. He's got,

131
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,370
he's always got a good opinion there. Yeah, Koa, just send me your mic. Okay.

132
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:47,780
Hi. So I read somewhere that the, how do you say? The exchange,

133
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:57,090
the centralized exchange like Coinbase, Binance, the number of like,

134
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:03,250
the percentage of trades are going down. And what's up is the,

135
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,790
how do you say it? Like SoFi,

136
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:15,670
distributed exchange where you don't have a centralized,

137
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,500
everything is like anonymous and decentralized.

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,700
So just to give you like the trend,

139
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,370
I think Coinbase is going to go up for the next six-month year,

140
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,260
but perhaps later, the trend will go like they will have to offer,

141
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:47,670
I don't know, decentralized trades because that's where it's hot.

142
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,210
Like the market is going there because if you have decentralized,

143
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,190
you have less fees, and you have more anonymity. Like you have better,

144
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
less government intervention,

145
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,520
less risk than going with decentralized transactions.

146
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,350
So what do you think about the vols though, Koa?

147
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,830
Do you think it's going to be like crazy volatile or do you think it's going to

148
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,520
start to really settle down? I'm actually surprised that it didn't double.

149
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,320
I mean, I thought it would double, triple in like Doge or something.

150
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,000
So I think the risk is to the upside.

151
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,620
Like the stock will go up if suddenly Bitcoin is going up,

152
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,520
and then everybody wants to FOMO and get into the coins,

153
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,680
whether Bitcoin or Ethereum or Doge or whatever.

154
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:52,460
So people will go in and want to be in the trade. So the volume will go up.

155
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,240
But I don't think they make money because they hold the cryptos.

156
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,690
Like if crypto doubles, they won't double their assets. I don't think so. Okay.

157
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,630
Maybe we could start by thinking about like how big this thing is, right?

158
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,110
If it's a huge company, right? It's going to be hard to move.

159
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,050
And if the volume is going to be huge, it's going to be hard to move.

160
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,440
So does anyone know how big this thing is? What's the market cap? What's that?

161
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,420
It's 11% of the crypto market. Dude, but how big is the company?

162
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,760
Like what's the market cap of this thing? How many shares are available?

163
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,730
It's like 61 billion. It's 61 billion? Oh, this is going to be a...

164
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,970
That should bring vols down like crazy.

165
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,590
Let me see. 185 million.

166
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah. Wow. 62 billion market cap. Shares outstanding. Almost 200 million.

167
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,670
So this is pretty big.

168
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,950
So to give you an idea, Binance market cap is 77 billion.

169
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,290
Okay.

170
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:26,260
So, guys, this looks like a sell. And they have 25.

171
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,520
Binance have 25% of market share.

172
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,660
And their value like slightly over like more than these companies at 11.

173
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,580
This has around. Like it moves, right? So the data is like it could be 11%,

174
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,140
I said. But it could be 14 right now or 9. I don't know.

175
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,200
Okay. Well,

176
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,680
just given that the market cap is honestly 65 billion or 68 billion,

177
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,180
that's huge, right?

178
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,320
This isn't like a GME $3 billion company easy to push around, right?

179
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,300
This is a lot of money that would take to move this thing.

180
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,500
So that's also, you know, if we see vols at like 100% tomorrow,

181
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,600
that would just be phenomenal. Phenomenal for us.

182
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,430
So, yeah, I think we're seeing over 100 is a sell for sure.

183
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,750
And we're talking about the one-year options here, right? Yeah, yeah.

184
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,610
The one-year options.

185
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,550
Because I'm thinking like it's got to be vols should be more than Tesla,

186
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,570
in my opinion. At least at the beginning.

187
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,900
Ryan's asking what is a what's Square vol when it IPO'd?

188
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,640
Let's see.

189
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,670
That could actually be a pretty good comparison, actually.

190
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,010
And Adam's mentioning it too, right? Two-year vol on Square right now is 47%.

191
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,160
Yeah. I'd actually say, guys, so I'm looking that up right now.

192
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,880
But as I do that,

193
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,210
I would actually say probably above like 75 vol is probably going to be a sell.

194
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,730
Let's see what Square was when it IPO'd. 60.

195
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,260
60 realized vol. The two-year was probably fair value is probably 45.

196
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,060
Question for you here. In terms of like time of day to sell it,

197
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,460
would you be looking to sell this right at the open?

198
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,240
Or do you think will there be like a lot of volume coming in throughout the day

199
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,420
that maybe it's worth waiting? I think you have your fair value.

200
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,540
I think for me, I'm going to put this at 70 fair value.

201
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,330
I'm just going off of like where Tesla is right now and also a 5% a day vol figure.

202
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,750
So anything that's a pretty big spread, I'm going to be selling it.

203
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,790
If this thing opens up at 100 vol, I'm going to sell it right in the morning.

204
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,070
I'm not going to put all the chips in the middle. But if it goes to, let's say,

205
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,610
120 vol, I'll get some more. And then unfortunately, if it keeps going,

206
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,850
I might have to get out of the position.

207
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,520
But I would be, I have my fair value and what vol I want to sell it at.

208
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,100
And if it opens up there, I'm going to have to sell it right away.

209
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,300
Got it.

210
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,860
Any other ideas? Steve B, you want to come chat? Birthday boy. Bring him in.

211
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,680
How's it going?

212
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:52,380
30. Wow, man, dude. How's it feel, man? It's almost your bedtime.

213
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,400
You're officially in the fossil gang. Me in the fossil gang, yeah.

214
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:05,030
I'll be like Jack, shout out to the fossil gang crew. Me, Dan, and uh... Right?

215
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,010
Anyways. Okay, I'll give my thoughts here. So first off,

216
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,370
I'd expect to see a lot of backwardation in the term structure, right, Jordan?

217
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,650
So just because if shorter-dated vols are 100, I don't think that's a sell.

218
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,170
Especially because it's an IPO, right? So 30-day vol, like that's a good point.

219
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,270
Like if people look at, oh, 30-day vol is 100, sell.

220
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,890
I don't think that's a good idea necessarily.

221
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,130
The other thing is there might not be super long-dated options.

222
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,840
So it might be only six months. So in that case, yeah.

223
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,950
They might not give you all the options up to 2023 and stuff.

224
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,940
And I think that's a really good point. Any ideas on how you would value this?

225
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,200
I think you guys brought up the good points for me.

226
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
The major point for lower vol is the market cap.

227
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,700
And the major point for higher vol is just the fact that it's an IPO.

228
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,420
And I think it's got a lot of challenging macro stuff that with Bitcoin regulation,

229
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,300
new players potentially entering the field fundamentally.

230
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,600
They've made a lot of revenue, but stuff's going to change, right?

231
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,230
So I wouldn't be surprised if it's half the price in six months.

232
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,220
So because at the same time, they just put out the IPO, right?

233
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
And people have to value this, right?

234
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,320
Just because it traded within a range for a couple of days,

235
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:44,580
I don't think that signifies that it's necessarily for sure going to be a lower

236
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,680
vol. But I was kind of thinking around the same.

237
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,800
If one-year vol was like at 100, to me, that seems conclusive enough.

238
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,880
So for six-month vol, what would that be like? It would be like 110, 120. Yeah,

239
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,870
yeah. But I wanted it to be, because I don't have a lot of confidence in that.

240
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,230
So if it's 110 on the high side, and I doubt it would open up low,

241
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,450
but if it opened up like under 50 on the,

242
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,030
like even the shorter-dated vol might be worth it.

243
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,090
That's kind of about the range I put.

244
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,670
So what do you think about Micah's idea that the second day of the IPO,

245
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,110
it'll only move 6%? What's your thoughts there?

246
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:34,700
And targeting that as the upper bound? Well, you're taking one day of data,

247
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,800
right? But it's like the IPO day. The IPO day itself,

248
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,980
it moved from 370 to 420 and then back down to 330. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Huge vol.

249
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,100
And I haven't gone, to be honest,

250
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,760
if I knew a little more about IPOs and everything,

251
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,900
but the earnings is going to be volatile as fuck. Yeah, exactly.

252
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,340
It always is for the, or potentially for these new listings, right?

253
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,740
So there's going to be some events of significant volatility.

254
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,450
I just think if it's super no-brainer, you take it, and then afterwards,

255
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,630
maybe we look at it and then look at the term structure and then see, well,

256
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,190
the term structure makes sense, right? Because there might be a trade there.

257
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,550
Yeah. So we look and see, hey, you know what? The term structure is flat.

258
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,260
That could be a trade, right? Exactly.

259
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,420
If this thing opens up flat vol surface tomorrow, and, you know,

260
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,200
it's 100 across the board, I think that's like a no-brainer easy trade. Yeah.

261
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,560
So like there might be a trade that comes up.

262
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,520
But I was going to approach it if there's something easy that comes up that I'm

263
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,040
like, this really makes sense. Like, I don't know.

264
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,530
Part of the part is when you sell like long-graded vol is, you know,

265
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,650
say it opens up at 75 and you sell, right? The six-month. What happens if it,

266
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,190
as you said, it goes up to 100, right? In that day. Yeah.

267
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,650
At the end of the day, you know, there's not going to be someone,

268
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,110
there might not be someone selling vol, right?

269
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,920
Like if it just has the right kind of combination of things.

270
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,920
And I'm not super sure how exactly, you know, it works. Like with ARKX,

271
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,280
it was a lot easier, right? Because you knew the volatility of the components.

272
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,800
It's not a- Exactly. This one's just so hard to value, right?

273
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,380
I do think that's where the, potentially there's obviously alpha there, right?

274
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,460
There's a ton, right? No one knows how to value this.

275
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,280
If you have a better dart, then, you know, at least for like a small position,

276
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,160
you could throw it at it, right? Right.

277
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,370
I think we're onto something too here in terms of like, you know,

278
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,850
the way we're looking at this,

279
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,750
the way we're trying to compare it to other things. What would be great?

280
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,650
And I don't know if we have information or data on it.

281
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,870
Does anyone have fundamental data on this thing in terms of balance sheet and stuff?

282
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,130
Because then we can start comparing it to other companies that have, you know,

283
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,180
similar characteristics. Like if this thing, imagine this thing,

284
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,720
we find out that it basically has all cash on the balance sheet and, you know,

285
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,140
revenues are pretty stable. I don't know. I haven't seen it. Well, you know,

286
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,940
this thing can't be volatile for too long, right? What do you think about that,

287
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,660
Steve? Mike is going to pull it up on his BBG. Yeah, he's a criminal. Yeah,

288
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,180
I agree.

289
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,200
But I do feel as though like I did read a couple articles and essentially like,

290
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,140
you know, they've been making all this revenue.

291
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,580
But the risk is kind of that they get squeezed out.

292
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,340
So it might not be as much like, like, I do think obviously the fundamentals,

293
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,340
if we can like more information, we get the better. Yeah.

294
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,410
You know, it's I think just tough. It's tough to value it.

295
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,290
Because what I was thinking of, like the way you value Tesla was so exact.

296
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,160
Right. And you should have all 20, you know, 20 points overvalued.

297
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,220
And you probably had a conference range of maybe five points on either side.

298
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,060
Right. Right. And in this situation,

299
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,010
like you have to have like a range of like 40 points, probably. So see,

300
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,410
let me ask you a hard question here. Gun to your head. What is fair value of,

301
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:36,260
let's say, one year vol for Coinbase? Fair value.

302
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,190
I'd probably say 60, but it wouldn't be selling it. Yeah.

303
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,190
Like if I had to sell it 60 or buy it 60, I'd sell it 60.

304
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,450
But I wouldn't sell it 60. Just because like if I think there's, you know,

305
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,610
10 points of edge, but I have no confidence in that, then I don't sell it.

306
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,870
Right. So you'd say 60 vol. And what do you think the odds are?

307
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,730
I would want to sell it a hundred.

308
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,450
And do you think there's any odds that this thing is actually worth 40 vol?

309
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,000
Um, yes. Me too. I actually, I do. Like, I think there's a chance,

310
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,030
but you can't be selling, you can't be selling vol. No, no, no.

311
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:22,050
I'm just trying to evaluate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think 40 is the lowest. Yeah,

312
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,910
yeah. If for some reason it opened like 40 vol, like,

313
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,530
like if it's opening similar to Snaps or whatever, then I think you buy it.

314
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,470
I don't know who said it in here, Steve, but if we think about it, like a,

315
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,150
like square, right. Square was kind of like a new technology when it came out.

316
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,690
But, but the only, the difference is, is that square had was,

317
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,420
was dealing with cash, right.

318
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,230
It wasn't dealing with like with the crypto space.

319
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:01,500
So maybe we could like say square plus some premium. Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,960
You got to have premium just because of the fact that you don't know. Right.

321
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,490
So it's like your margin of error. Right. Yes. I'd actually say 60 vol,

322
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,310
65 vol would probably be fair value. And we'd want to be selling at 85 plus.

323
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,590
Exactly. Yeah. For the one year.

324
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,550
So the one year is probably probably a hundred. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

325
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,190
Really good point. Well, yeah, there's no way,

326
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,980
there's no way I'm selling 30 day at a hundred vol. Yeah. Because like, Christ,

327
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,960
I mean, just how we had on the initial day. Exactly. You know, you're done.

328
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,200
You're right. It's not a, not worth it. And yeah, we'll have a, have a look.

329
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,710
I'll be, I'll be curious. But the market may come like, you know, I haven't,

330
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,090
I haven't actually watched many of these single stock IPOs and I don't like the

331
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,170
ones that I looked at with me get a couple I looked at,

332
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:00,570
they seem pretty fairly priced actually. So got it. If it,

333
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,330
I guess if it comes out fairly priced, at least we did a good analysis.

334
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,770
Exactly. Exactly. Okay. Let's see what we got here. Let's see. We got,

335
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,490
we got some questions here for Steve. Potentially you can answer them.

336
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,860
Adam saying if it's flat, if it's a flat surface, can we do a calendar spread?

337
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,360
Absolutely. Absolutely. The issue is though,

338
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,860
Adam is that realized vol could be tough. It could honestly be very,

339
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,760
very tough to value.

340
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,580
And I think maybe just trading one leg tomorrow might be the ideal,

341
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,640
the ideal way to go.

342
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,960
Okay. So we got some, we got some earnings data here. Thanks to iPhone.

343
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,640
I think Eric's pointing out a good point there as well.

344
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,160
Yeah.

345
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:54,390
So Adam saying what happened with RBLX IPO vols were way overpriced, right?

346
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,350
So you could solve all there and it came down pretty quick.

347
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,100
And I think that's a tendency, right? Especially with these hype IPOs.

348
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,860
The only one that I haven't,

349
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:10,280
that I saw where like vol ripped like crazy was BYND, right? Vols came out,

350
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,400
they were priced. I think it was like 70 vol and the thing just ripped.

351
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,140
But other than that, they seem to be overpriced usually.

352
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,390
But BYND, like when it came out, did it have as much hype as like it became?

353
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,710
Cause didn't it like,

354
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,510
because what happened is after IPO just kept going up and up and up.

355
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,230
I don't know what.

356
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,350
Yeah.

357
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,460
Like that'd be a good one to kind of think of just like what could go wrong.

358
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,580
But that was a smaller market cap too, right? It was. Yeah. This is huge, man.

359
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,130
And I think that's a really good point, Steve. This thing's huge, right?

360
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,770
It's gonna take a lot of money to move this. But even look at Tesla, man.

361
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,890
We're seeing Tesla move at 60 vol right now.

362
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,890
Yeah. I was thinking of like a member of the tribute had,

363
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,110
didn't really work out on what was it? Chinese.

364
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,990
GSX? No. The one before it was before that. Was it ETF? No, Steve.

365
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,080
It didn't work out? Yeah. We got out of it pretty quick. Oh, lit. Oh, fine. No,

366
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,910
no, not lit. What was that one? I haven't traded any other one.

367
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,630
The one that got into the EV space. That was lit. No.

368
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,600
It's single stock. I can't remember the name,

369
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:41,390
but it was a large market cap and it ripped. I don't remember it. Baidu? Baidu.

370
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,250
Got it. Yeah. That was, that was pretty bad.

371
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,690
But eventually vols came down like crazy. Eventually.

372
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,280
After you got a margin call. Yeah. Like that selling high IV rank.

373
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,800
But even then though, right?

374
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,280
That thing was only moving five or 6% a day just because the vols I was selling

375
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,000
at 60 and it was realizing 80. Yeah. Like it wasn't that.

376
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,200
And it moved one direction the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. I think,

377
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,140
I think we can come to the conclusion. We are going to, we're going to say 65,

378
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:21,200
60 to 65 vol is fair value. And 85 vol and above for the one year.

379
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,040
We are huge sellers in.

380
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:33,010
I like that. I like that for tomorrow. If it opens up at 120, I'm shopping.

381
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,590
If it opens up at 120, it goes all in.

382
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:43,610
I have some fundamental data. Perfect. Thanks Tico.

383
00:29:46,360 --> 00:30:00,830
So Coinbase revenue basically quadruple this year. So they, they,

384
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,620
they were making 1 billion and now they're making, oh, hold on. Sorry.

385
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:12,320
They were making 500 million in 2019. It doubled to 1.2 or something like that.

386
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:19,800
And now in the first quarter, they're making 1.8. In the first quarter. So,

387
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:30,460
so basically 7.2 for the whole year compared to 1.2. How about their earnings?

388
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,080
Do you have their earnings there too? Yeah. That's the earnings.

389
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,250
What about their, their debt to equity? Are they all,

390
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,990
what's their balance there? I like, of course, you know,

391
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,270
the first couple of days can be crazy volatile still.

392
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,890
Cause all the flows coming in, but if we're selling that longer dated stuff,

393
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,830
eventually that's going to die out and go towards its fundamental value.

394
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,090
So if we can get a good sense of what's up, what's going on on that side,

395
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,170
that's equity Tico. What do you got there? Hold on, hold on.

396
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,200
I don't have access. Oh my goodness. Tico. I thought you were the,

397
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,360
I thought you were the guy. I thought you were the fundamental expert there,

398
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,560
man. I thought you had all the data. I wasn't looking for that.

399
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,580
I wasn't looking for that. Debt to assets is 83%. According to this,

400
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:26,080
it's a 5.86 billion in assets and 4.8 billion in liabilities. Wow.

401
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,330
So it's positive equity. Is that all debt? Can you see or no? It doesn't.

402
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:37,660
I have no details. It's just a high level balance sheet. Got it. Okay.

403
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,180
So it has some equity, which is good. Just to give you an idea, Binance,

404
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,330
everything is double. Like revenue, like profit.

405
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:52,160
They're making 1 billion profit last year. Got it. And is there any vol on,

406
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,830
like Binance is not public, right? I don't think so.

407
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,290
Else we would have heard about it. Yeah. Tico, I got an idea.

408
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,910
What was this valued at a year ago? Right. You know how they did the IPO,

409
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,230
right?

410
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,430
And they have a valuation at the IPO. Like this was private before, right?

411
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,680
What? Coinbase? Coinbase. Yeah. Yeah. But it had a valuation, right?

412
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,420
So what was his valuation last year? How did that change from this year? Right.

413
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,850
So over the course of the year, how much did it move? Right.

414
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,500
I would say that would be an absolute extreme probably.

415
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,180
I know that Binance multiplied by 14, their valuation last year.

416
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:53,040
Like 2020. Multiplied by 14. Okay. So Binance has grown then, Tico.

417
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:01,810
Yeah, but Binance is 85 billion in market cap. Yeah. And it has grown by 14.

418
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:09,740
So divided by 14. And, oh, sorry. Coinbase is 85. What was Coinbase's,

419
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
like what would be their market cap a year ago?

420
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,590
Okay, let me check.

421
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,450
Because if it grew like 20X,

422
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:31,000
then that's obviously concerning.

423
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,590
I'm going to stick with my numbers.

424
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,670
I'm going to stick with that 60-65 fair value for the one year. Not even.

425
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,340
I'd say 60. 60 fair value for the one year, Steve. Yeah.

426
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,860
So 85, I'm a seller. 80, maybe I'm a seller.

427
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,850
Yeah. And if we get like something like in that maybe range,

428
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,910
maybe it pumps up a bit. Exactly, right? There's got to be some,

429
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,690
I might even put like a limit order in. Just get me in at 85 vol or 90 vol.

430
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,860
But we'll see how this thing opens up tomorrow.

431
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,560
Everyone's going to have the trigger ready. And see you all bright and early.

432
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,750
Yeah, see you guys bright and early tomorrow. Any other questions?

433
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,820
Let's see.

434
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,950
Eric's saying here that the shares were trading at $345 a share privately.

435
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,280
Interesting. What did this IPO at? Didn't it IPO at 345?

436
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,460
It IPO'd right around there, but then it shot right up.

437
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,490
It IPO'd at 380. Wow, I thought they would mark it up way higher than that.

438
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,020
The insiders were pissed. Yeah, I bet. I'd be living.

439
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,240
Okay. So that's the ideas we have for tomorrow.

440
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,100
If you guys have any other idea on what this thing should be trading at,

441
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,190
please let us know. Just to recap, we use Square Vol. Square Vol IPO,

442
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,580
Square Vol today. Tesla. We're not using GME.

443
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,580
We're using some of the brokerages right now.

444
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,360
We're using one of the brokers in Canada that are similar, Sean's saying.

445
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,140
And then a couple digital ones in China,

446
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,200
which are trading at around 80 to 100 vol.

447
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,480
And that's probably going to be obviously a little more volatile.

448
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:38,250
So anywhere above 80, that should be a sell on this thing. Okay?

449
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,910
Especially because the largest move after the first day was only 6%.

450
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,990
And it's moving 3% a day right now. So I know we don't have a lot of data,

451
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,670
but my best guess would be anything above 80 for the one-year option is a clear

452
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,030
sell.

453
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,020
Rising Bloomberg compares coin to some weird companies. Yeah,

454
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,260
let us know what the vols are there. Just post them in there.

455
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,580
Post them in the chat later on, in the Discord chat.

456
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,800
Any comparables you guys have there, let us know. The more information,

457
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,240
the better decision we can make.

458
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,970
Sleep well tonight because it's going to be a wild ride tomorrow. Yeah.

459
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,210
Imagine a blowout in the morning. I doubt it. I doubt it. All right, guys,

460
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:32,520
get ready. Before we sell. Mike, liquidate the other stuff, man.

461
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:40,150
Get ready for it. Yeah. Collect your $8 off of, what is it? ARCX?

462
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,120
Take those dollars and run? All my accounts in ARCX right now.

463
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,380
So liquidating that would be kind of difficult for me. Yeah, I know, right? Oh,

464
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,500
man.
