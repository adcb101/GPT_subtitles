1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
What's up everyone? So today I'm really excited to bring you this.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,450
We're gonna be starting up in R and I think you guys are gonna be super excited

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:07,790
with this.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,830
I've been so excited bringing you guys this it's probably a 30 part video with 5

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,840
to 10 minute videos in between and Every day we're gonna do a little bit of art

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,360
to get closer to our end goal of being able to back test to be able to scrape data

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,360
from the internet pull data wrangle data and make be able to create and Create profitable

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,060
trading strategies So with that said guys, let's get to it.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,180
I am currently on a MacBook I'm gonna go over what it would look like if you were

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,810
on a Windows so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go to Google.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,560
We're gonna type in download R so you're gonna have this thing right here if you're

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,190
a Windows user just click right here and Download this download this link right

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,360
here But for ours Mac users,

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:13,440
we'll go download R for Mac click on the first link and We are going to be downloading

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,410
this first package right here, so let's go ahead and click on it.

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,640
It's gonna download Excuse that it's gonna take about a couple minutes.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,980
So I'm gonna skip this part now and and move forward If you guys are using Windows

18
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,060
just answer the standard Prompts that they send you as you're clicking through the

19
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,240
download function features Okay,

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,640
while this is loading we're gonna go download our studio.

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:50,020
So our studio is a place where you can code so remember R is just the The coding

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,100
language, but you want to have a nice HUD something.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,800
It's called a GUI GUI something that you want to just be able to write code in like

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,050
a script like a file So that's gonna be called our studio So, let's go.

25
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,510
It's gonna be the first link. Oh sorry,

26
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:14,100
it's gonna be here download our studio click on that and Then we're gonna scroll

27
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,940
all the way down So Windows users are gonna be downloading this link right here

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,370
but for us We are going to be downloading this one right here secondly So let's

29
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,690
download that So now we have the two things running we have our and we have our

30
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,110
studio So before you actually open up the R studio,

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,990
let's make sure R is installed So it's gonna say just gonna say continue continue

32
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:54,740
Agree We'll install for all users And install Password,

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:07,360
okay type in the password for your Mac Okay,

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,980
we'll close and we're gonna move that to the trash. Okay.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,020
Now we have R installed So this is what R looks like by itself,

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,230
so it's this thing right here bottom left So this is called the R programming language,

37
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,650
right? You can type in something let's say 4 plus 4 is 8 Well,

38
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,670
you see how ugly this like layout looks it doesn't look very clean doesn't look

39
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:36,480
very nice So what we want to do is we want to use R studio So let's go ahead and

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,780
finish.

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:45,190
So we click on the bottom left It'll start pop up And we'll just drag that into

42
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,470
applications oops,

43
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:57,580
and we will replace Because I already have R studio Downloaded but you guys might

44
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,340
not have this. Oh,

45
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:08,760
you guys won't have this All right So now I believe that is all so close this out

46
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:17,940
Now you should go to your applications And you will have something like this So

47
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:31,820
now guys we are officially ready to start our programming journey All right now

48
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,700
as quants Okay, so I already have a whole bunch of day.

49
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,340
It looks like Reinstalling it. It just opened up my previous sessions.

50
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,660
You guys will have a blank page here So you guys will have something that looks

51
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,160
exactly like this Since we're quants, we have to go dark screen Initially,

52
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,680
it'll be a white screen,

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,760
but you guys need to change that we are quants here so in In the Mac,

54
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,340
it's called view. I can't remember what it is in Microsoft,

55
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,450
but It's what it's one of the tabs that at the top here So you want to go to panes

56
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,290
and you want to go to pane layout?

57
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:19,050
We're gonna go to appearance We're gonna change our studio theme to sky It's gonna

58
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,170
change the background here,

59
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,270
but we want to change this actually to dark So what we're gonna do you can scroll

60
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,590
through the list here. This is the one guys tomorrow night blue.

61
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:35,540
This is the quant Background so we're gonna hit apply and then okay,

62
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,440
and here we are now.

63
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,690
We're ready So this is our studio and we're just gonna do Our first our first two

64
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,930
lines of code To get started, but you know,

65
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,490
this is gonna be a long process guys You know,

66
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,710
we're gonna chip away at it every single day and eventually we're gonna get there

67
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,800
so Are at the simplest form as a calculator, right?

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,420
So you can do something like four plus four and then you hit enter so on the Mac,

69
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,740
it's for me its command enter you hold down command you press enter and on a windows,

70
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,340
it's It's one of the keys either to shift enter or I think control enter it's one

71
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,220
of those Now run down here so now we have we output eight So this right here guys

72
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,500
at the bottom is called a console.

73
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,560
So this you could say four plus four eight But up here,

74
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,460
so whatever you type in here and press enter it'll automatically run, right?

75
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,400
but up here we have our script so you can write stuff here like Hello,

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,940
and nothing will happen right you can go to the next line.

77
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,060
Nothing will happen This is just it's like a Microsoft Word script But once you

78
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,500
press enter or command enter it'll run that script and you can also run the command

79
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:04,320
like this so let's say we have four plus four and We have eight plus eight We can

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,320
highlight these Press run and it'll run both.

81
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,410
It'll run both of them or we can just go command enter command enter so at its simplest

82
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,740
form R is a Calculator All right,

83
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,880
we can go 8 times 5 divided by 2 and Outcomes number 20. So this is our script.

84
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,630
This is our console Over here. We have our environment.

85
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,970
So in a programming language let's say we Okay,

86
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,390
maybe we'll get to this in a second.

87
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:46,150
Let's start off with our first function our first script Which is going to be to

88
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:54,490
print hello world and Command enter boom. We just have printed.

89
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:01,610
Hello world Now this print right here is called a function right,

90
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,150
so if you go question mark print, which just says Basically,

91
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,290
tell me about print and press command enter It'll tell us a little bit about the

92
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,260
function, right?

93
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:25,480
So you put in an object into the function which we said hello world and Out will

94
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:34,200
come Right, you can see examples Out will come Whatever you put in here, right?

95
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
It'll print it to the console.

96
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:44,270
So if we said print 10 It'll print 10 now Similarly,

97
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,410
you can just run 10 and I'll print 10.

98
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,550
So this is the most basic command now Let's say we want to save this variable.

99
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,580
So we're gonna store it. Okay,

100
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:02,340
so this is where our environment is gonna come into play let's say we do a or my

101
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:19,000
first line equals to print Hello world when we run my

102
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,770
first line It comes out to hello world Right,

103
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,110
and we actually don't even need to say print. Hello world.

104
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,150
We can just take that out Hello world Type it again.

105
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,170
And now when we take that out So if you notice it doesn't print it when we did it

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,650
when we said print My first line print hello world out came hello world,

107
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,030
but in this case,

108
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:53,440
we're just saying My first line equals hello world now we can say print my first

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,940
line Hello world, just so you guys can see in our global environment. Now.

110
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,890
We have this thing called My first line and what it's what its value is is hello

111
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,270
world,

112
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,000
right if we have let's say X equals 10 Now we have a new variable called X and value

113
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,840
is 10 And if you guys want to save your script you go you hit this button here save

114
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,780
You save it as my first Saving whatever document you want.

115
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,020
Let's say we save it in documents.

116
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:36,900
We hit save and now we can reference this by clicking on this little folder finder

117
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:45,970
Let's go documents Date modified my first are and there it is.

118
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,810
So now we can just run the code once again So I hope that was helpful guys in our

119
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,210
first session on our and our studio and getting started.
