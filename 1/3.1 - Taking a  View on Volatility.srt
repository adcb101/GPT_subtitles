00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820
Hey everyone and welcome to our video on structures So just like in the stock market

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,370
when you think the stock is going up You buy the stock and when you think the stock

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,950
is going down you can short the stock Well,

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,770
the same is actually true in the options market if you think implied volatilities

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,030
Overestimating the future realized volatility. Well,

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,900
you want to be able to short volatility Conversely if you think that options are

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,280
cheap,

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,320
you know implied volatility is cheap relative to the future volatility Then you

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,380
won't be able to buy volatility But you can't go into the market just like you can

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,600
in stocks and go and buy volatility or sell volatility There's no asset that says

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,360
for example Apple Volatility where you if you don't like it,

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,920
you can sell it and if you like it you can buy it We don't have this in the market

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,530
But what we do have is options and because options are volatility products We can

14
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,770
use them to take a view on Volatility.

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,310
So how can we actually structure a trade that takes a view on this? Well,

16
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,450
this is where structures come in bronze.

17
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:38,730
We're gonna focus on two structures a straddle and Iron condor Now

18
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,230
don't you worry if you are unsure what a straddle is or an iron condor is We are

19
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,610
going to go through it in depth throughout this course You're also going to be seeing

20
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,110
it come up over and over again and you're gonna be seeing your fellow traders talking

21
00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:06,970
about these trades frequently so a straddle is long Volatility Meaning you like

22
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,750
volatility.

23
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:23,010
You think volatility is cheap The iron condor is short volatility Now

24
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,700
with both these structures We don't want to take a view on The underlying stock

25
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,800
or the price or the direction?

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,060
We want to just take a view on volatility So we need to structure these products

27
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,800
Where they are neutral on Direction one thing to keep in mind guys as you go and

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,200
learn from other sources as well Is that you will see people saying iron condors

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,420
are the best strategy or straddles are the best strategy?

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,300
the truth is These are not strategies These are tools to take a view on volatility

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,340
Think about it if you are electrician if you have a nail to hit you're gonna use

32
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,420
a hammer not a screwdriver The same goes with options market if you want to sell

33
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,640
volatility. Well,

34
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,460
you're gonna short an iron condor If you want to be buying volatility you want to

35
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,720
be buying the straddle So these this is what these positions look like Let's say

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:37,920
Apple Is trading at $200 a share What you would go and do is you would go into the

37
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:52,650
options market and buy the $200 straddle and it would look exactly like this where

38
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,680
if the stock Where the point of the straddle is?

39
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:14,180
200 and let's say down here is 220 and down here is 180 on the y-axis we have our

40
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:22,900
P&L What this means is if the stock Breaks out into this region.

41
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,520
Let's say 220 or breaks down into this region we'll say 180 we start making money

42
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,400
and As the stock continues to go up we make more and more money and as the stock

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,040
continues to go down We make more and more money.

44
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,520
So we don't have a view on direction But what we do have is a view on the size of

45
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,280
the move and As you guys know the size of the move is another word for volatility

46
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,920
So what this straddle is telling us is that the market?

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:05,380
Expects the stock to stay within this range So this is stocks at 200 the markets

48
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,440
expecting it to hang around here somewhere Okay,

49
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:23,470
let's call this 205 Let's call this 195 and On this point over here 205 so the market

50
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:30,630
is expecting the stock to stay within this $10 range But when we buy this straddle

51
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,630
what we are saying is that it's going to go beyond this range In fact,

52
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:45,850
it's going to be either down here Below 195 or it's going to be up here Above 205

53
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,430
So you guys can see that when volatility expands We actually are going to make money.

54
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,150
So that is why we say a straddle a long straddle not a short straddle a long straddle

55
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,550
Is long volatility now,

56
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:09,000
let's head over to iron condors the way an iron condor looks is actually The straddle

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,780
but instead we're selling it.

58
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,740
So it looks like this But that's not just it we actually go out and buy further

59
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,530
out of the money options To cap our loss. Now.

60
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,820
I'm sure you're asking like why do we decide to buy the wings? Well,

61
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,460
let's go back over here when we buy the straddle we have unlimited potential for

62
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,380
gains If a stock declares bankruptcy We're the stock is going to go all the way

63
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,770
down to near zero and we are gonna make a lot of money If the stock gets bought

64
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,920
out the stock will go up a hundred percent and we're gonna make a ton of money We

65
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,460
have unlimited gain potential here Now if we're short the straddle We have unlimited

66
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,450
loss potential This is not prudent risk management to have unlimited loss potential

67
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:17,360
So what we decide to do is buy our wings to cap our max loss So the P&L for this

68
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:28,100
will look something like this Where we expect the stock to stay within this range.

69
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,910
Let's say this is the 195 and this is the 205 We expect the market to stay within

70
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:48,980
this When we go out of that region We start to lose money We are betting on volatility

71
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,860
going down.

72
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:58,900
We are short Volatility also with this item condor We are directionless meaning

73
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:06,680
we don't care if the stock goes to 205 or 195 or 197 or 199 as Long as it stays

74
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,460
within this range between 195 and 205 so we are using this item condor to take a

75
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:21,320
directionless view and bet on volatility if Volatility is less than what the market

76
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,960
implied Realized volatility is less than what the market implied This iron condor

77
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:35,180
is gonna make money and this straddle is gonna lose money So depending on your view

78
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:42,060
of the market you can decide which tool to use No tool is better than the other

79
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,980
You will see a lot of the time where people say short volatility is always better

80
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,900
or a long volatility is always better There is no better in options There is only

81
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,400
what is your view and what tool do you use to take your view on the market?

82
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,430
now I know a lot of you come from the Delta one space or the directional space and

83
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,880
This I'm sure is very foreign to you But let me tell you something Options are a

84
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,320
volatility product in order to master options We need to understand that they are

85
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,320
volatility products and how to actually trade them Strictly on volatility in the

86
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,280
future We are actually going to bring direction in to our trading strategies and

87
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,820
that's going to be covered in silver Stick with me throughout this course and you
