1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,160
Okay, guys, so in this video,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,290
we're going to be talking about bankroll management, okay?

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,010
And why bankroll management is actually a make or break in your trading.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,130
If you don't have bankroll management,

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,710
you can turn a winning strategy into a losing strategy. Okay?

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,850
And that's why it's so important. And today in the group,

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,230
we actually saw it for the first time.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,210
We actually got our first taste at a five standard deviation move in the group,

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,230
right? CRM.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,170
This is by far one of the biggest earnings blowouts I've seen since I started trading.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,910
And a lot of the time, we don't think our max loss is actually possible, right?

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,950
None of us here has seen our max loss until today.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,470
And it can actually destroy you,

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,790
it can cripple your account if you bet too big.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,210
So that's what we're gonna be talking about today, bankroll management,

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,430
and how this can actually, you know, make you a profitable trader,

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,010
assuming you have a good strategy. Okay?

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:02,220
And how it will cripple you if you don't have this. Okay? Win or lose,

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,200
if you don't have this, you will never make it as a profitable trader. Okay?

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,860
And we're gonna go over why in detail,

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,240
and I think you guys are gonna get a lot of value out of this. Okay.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,600
So let's jump into it. We're gonna be playing a game here.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,020
I'm gonna give you guys a hypothetical example,

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,140
and I want you guys to take a guess on what the answer is.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,420
And the winner of this is going to, like we said, get a one-on-one tomorrow.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,120
So let's play a game, okay? We are going to the casino, and let's call it,

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,200
you know, some type of new blackjack game. Okay?

28
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,450
We go to the casino with $1,000 in our bank account.

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,270
We're playing this game where when we win, we win 1.2. And when we lose,

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,130
we lose whatever we put down at the casino.

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:54,140
And we have a 60% chance that we win. So that means a 40% chance that we lose.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,450
Okay? Imagine we took a trade here. Our winners are 1.2 times our losers,

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:07,120
and we win 60% of the time. How much of this $1,000 should we bet? Okay?

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,480
To stab at that, guys, put your comments down here,

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,920
and we'll take a look at it towards the end.

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,420
So what we're gonna calculate here, guys,

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,940
is there's actually an optimal bet size.

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,320
There's actually the perfect amount to grow your account.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,940
If you bet more than this, you don't do well. If you bet less than this,

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,860
you don't do as well. Okay? And this is what we call the Kelly Criterion.

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,640
So this is what we use. Now, it can get very advanced,

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,820
but this is actually very simple.

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,400
And this is what a lot of professional gamblers use all the time.

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
It's actually the basis of risk management and option trading.

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,980
So that is the Kelly Criterion.

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,960
What the Kelly Criterion tells us is if we want to optimize our expectancy,

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,740
meaning if we want to make the most money in the long run,

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,620
how much should we be betting? And that is what the Kelly Criterion is.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,120
So the formula for that is the probability you win, okay,

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,760
times the odds that you win. Okay, we're going to call that B, plus one,

51
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,800
minus one, divided by the odds of you winning. Okay?

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,460
This formula is going to maximize our long-term gains, right?

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,160
It's going to make sure we don't go bankrupt. Okay?

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,160
So we're going to plug in these numbers into here and find out who is the closest

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,420
to the winner. Now, this is the Kelly Criterion, okay?

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,080
Probability of you winning, the odds of you winning, plus one, minus one,

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,440
divided by the odds of you winning, the odds on your bet. Right?

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,780
So the odds on our bet here was 1.2. Okay? We win 1.2 times our losers.

59
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,400
We bet $100 and we lose, we're going to lose 100. But if we win,

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,370
we're going to win 120. Okay?

61
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,810
So we're going to plug it into this formula and we're going to see who wins here.

62
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:18,080
So we have probability of us winning, 60%. The odds that we're getting are 1.2,

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:28,920
plus one, minus one. Okay? Divided by 1.2.

64
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:43,350
So this is going to be 0.6 times 2.2, minus one, divided by 1.2.

65
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,910
So 0.32 divided by 1.2. 0.27.

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:05,020
0.27. Yeah. Okay. So on our $1,000 account, is it 0.027 or 0.27? 0.27. Okay.

67
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:19,680
So on our $1,000 account, okay, we should be betting $270 per bet. Now,

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,400
this number right here is going to optimize our long-term expectancy.

69
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,550
We have to bet $270 every time. Okay?

70
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,390
Some people will come in here and they'll bet too much. Okay? Not good.

71
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,350
And some people will come in and bet too little,

72
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,810
and that's not optimizing their bank. That's not optimizing their expectancy.

73
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,720
Okay? Now that we know this, so you guys, so far so good,

74
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,080
this is how much we should be betting to optimize our bank.

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,680
But what does this mean? What does this mean? What does this $270 mean?

76
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,140
So this, by the way, guys, is called our Kelly fraction. Okay?

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,780
That's our Kelly fraction.

78
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,390
Okay? This is optimizing our bankroll without the risk of blowing up. Okay?

79
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:12,480
Now, let us, let us, oh, sorry, guys, you still, yeah, okay.

80
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,580
Now let us go into an example of why we need to know this and why it's so important.

81
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,780
Okay. Okay. So we said our Kelly score equals 270. Okay?

82
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm going to draw a couple of scenarios here.

83
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,360
And by the way, guys, we have an expected, we have a positive expectancy,

84
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:45,240
right? Our strategy, okay? Expected value is equal to 0.6 times 1.2, right?

85
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,640
Minus, this is all from bronze, minus 0.4 times 1. Right?

86
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,760
That's our expected value. So we go 0.6 times 1.2,

87
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:08,900
0.72 minus 0.4 equals 32 cents. Okay? For every dollar we bet,

88
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,880
we're going to make 32 cents. That's our expectancy, our long run expectancy.

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,920
For every dollar I bet, I'm either going to, on average, right?

90
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm either going to win $1.20 or I'm going to lose $1. But on average,

91
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,560
I'm going to make 32 cents. Okay? So I'm going to draw a couple examples here.

92
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,800
So imagine we sit down at this game. We sit down at this game. Obviously,

93
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,820
we're going to become rich. We're going to become filthy rich, right?

94
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,120
If we can sit at this game forever and ever and ever,

95
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,780
we're going to become billionaires.

96
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,930
So let's graph this out. Let's graph out our play. So here is time zero.

97
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,890
And here is money one. Okay? This is our bankroll.

98
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,910
We're going to call this our bankroll.

99
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,550
Okay? I'm going to draw a couple graphs for you guys.

100
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,430
So let's say we come to this game starting at $1,000.

101
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,110
Okay? So on our y-axis, we have our bankroll. Okay? And then here,

102
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,290
we have the number of games we played. So let's say we start with zero.

103
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,230
And then by the end of the year, we've played 5,000 games. 5,000 hands. Okay?

104
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,770
And our first graph looks like this.

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:36,570
Okay? That's our first graph. Our second graph looks like this.

106
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,390
Okay? We're going to do four graphs, actually, guys. Make it a little more fun.

107
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,390
Our third graph looks like this.

108
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,820
And our final graph looks like this.

109
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,080
Okay? So these are four different people playing this game. Okay?

110
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,500
We have four different people playing this game.

111
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,660
We're going to call them Marcos, Ram, Lavelle, and Dan. Okay?

112
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,960
These guys are all playing this game.

113
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:27,010
I want you guys to tell me how much each person is betting at this game.

114
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,310
So remember, we have $1,000. Okay?

115
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,340
And we're going to talk in terms of Kelly fractions. Okay?

116
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,800
So we know Kelly of 1 is 270. Okay? I want you guys to tell me,

117
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,900
what Kelly fraction is this guy betting at? So you can scale from, let's say,

118
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,540
0.1, means 10% of Kelly, all the way up to, let's call it 2 times Kelly. Okay?

119
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,520
So you're betting 2 times the Kelly fraction. And right now,

120
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,620
we're playing a game that is a long run. The more we play,

121
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,500
the more money we make. Right? It's a long-term expected value game.

122
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,220
The more games, the more money. Okay? So first one. Blue guy.

123
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,100
What Kelly fraction is he betting at? Okay? Let's see what we got here.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,380
So what Kelly fraction is this guy? We have this crazy, crazy P&L graph,

125
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
and it goes all the way up here. What fraction is he betting at?

126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,280
So Koa's saying 2. Marco's saying 2. Okay? So 2. How about this guy?

127
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,920
He's got a smoother P&L. It goes right here. What's this guy betting at? 1.5.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,320
Okay.

129
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,050
Okay. How about this guy right here? This guy in the green.

130
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,090
So he's got a really smooth P&L. What's he doing? He's doing 1.

131
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,930
Kyle's saying 1. Okay. And how about this guy? How about this guy?

132
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,690
It looks like he lost a lot of his money. What happened to him?

133
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,560
Pranav's saying 0.5, 0.69. Okay. We're going to call it.

134
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,360
What are you guys saying here? 0.5, 0.3. Okay. Awesome. Awesome.

135
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,280
We're going to go with 0.5.

136
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
Okay. Guys, I got to tell you something.

137
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,760
You guys had this flipped. Everyone had this flipped. Okay.

138
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,220
Kyle's saying negative 1. Okay. Let's talk about this.

139
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:28,870
The guy who lost all his money, you know what he did? He bet $280.

140
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:39,700
He bet $280 at that casino. He bet over 1 of the Kelly Criterion.

141
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:46,390
He bet over 1. He loses money in the long run. This guy up here,

142
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:54,100
he did 1 times Kelly. Remember, Kelly optimizes your bankroll.

143
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,180
It optimizes your expectancy given your bankroll.

144
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,980
So this is always going to be the highest out of all different combinations.

145
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,410
Okay. So this is the highest. The next highest is not full Kelly, right?

146
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,580
So this guy right here, he's betting $270. This guy right here, he's betting,

147
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:29,240
let's call it half Kelly. Okay. So he's betting 140. Okay. And this guy,

148
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,120
he's betting a quarter of Kelly. So he's betting .25 Kelly,

149
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,820
which is about 80 bucks.

150
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,830
And this guy down here is betting, we're going to call it $300.

151
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,010
Because in the long run, if he bets more than this number,

152
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,690
he turns a winning strategy, a very profitable strategy. Imagine this, guys.

153
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,290
Imagine every time you bet, you got 32 cents for every dollar.

154
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,330
Imagine every time you bet $10,000, you got on average 3,200 back.

155
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,900
That's the strategy right here.

156
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,860
And this guy does phenomenal because he bets Kelly.

157
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,660
This guy does good because he bets half Kelly. This guy does okay,

158
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,020
but he didn't maximize. But look, his P&L is very smooth.

159
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,460
And he bet quarter Kelly.

160
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,580
This guy who maybe he didn't understand bankroll management,

161
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
he lost all his money.

162
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,250
Okay. And why is this the case? How can this be possible?

163
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,030
How can this be possible in the long run? Well, if you think about it,

164
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,410
if he's betting, let's say $300.

165
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,820
Okay.

166
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,230
Let's go with a bigger amount just so you guys can make sense of it.

167
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:51,600
Imagine he's betting 500 bucks. Okay. It's only going to take him two times.

168
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,280
He only has to win. He only has to lose two times in a row to go down,

169
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,020
to lose his whole bankroll. Right. And if we know some mathematics, we win.

170
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,980
Sorry. We lose, right, 0.4 times 0.4. That's 50 points. Right.

171
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,970
We lose two times in a row, 16% of the time. Right. And if we do that again,

172
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:26,260
6.4% of the time. Right. We lose three times in a row. And four times in a row,

173
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,320
by the time we go bankrupt, it's about 1% of the time.

174
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,720
But the way that Kelly Criterion is built is that it's unlikely for us to lose four

175
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,100
times in a row without at least us getting a head start. Okay. We only lose,

176
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,960
you know, at the initial start 1% of the time. Okay.

177
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,960
So that is how Kelly Criterion works.

178
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:56,380
It helps us avoid maximizing our bankroll as well as avoiding bankruptcy. Okay.

179
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,080
Okay. So that's, that's on the whiteboard I want to show you.

180
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,200
Then I was just going to show you guys a,

181
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,410
an example on my computer super quick. So I know,

182
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,410
I know the guys that read the Yoon Sinclair book, I did the same thing as well.

183
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,730
I skipped over risk bankroll management.

184
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,570
And actually Yoon Sinclair didn't introduce me to Kelly Criterion,

185
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,150
but I've read somewhere else. And then I realized he did a lot of work on it.

186
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,550
So he, in this example, he does the exact same thing.

187
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,910
He shows us what I just showed you. Okay. And, you know,

188
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,070
if there's any mathematicians,

189
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,330
you guys can go in and learn a little bit more about the math.

190
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,930
The black line here is Kelly. It's full Kelly. It optimizes your bet,

191
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,660
your bankroll. This line down here is half Kelly.

192
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,580
He's betting half the optimal size.

193
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,060
And this where the guy eventually goes bankrupt is twice Kelly.

194
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,980
Two times the Kelly Criterion. Okay. So that is what happens, right?

195
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,140
This is our dollar P&L. So this is why bankroll management is so important.

196
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,280
Because if you're betting,

197
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,400
so let's actually take it back to an iron condor example.

198
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,420
Now we're actually going to do it right here, right here on the live.

199
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,660
So let's do an iron condor example. Okay. So here we have an iron condor.

200
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,530
Okay. Now let's say when we win.

201
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,410
Now the thing that's a little bit different with trading is that there's no binary

202
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,770
outcome. It's not like you either win or you lose. You could be over here,

203
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,970
right? Or you can be over here. There's lots of different combinations.

204
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,210
And this is actually where Hune Sinclair has done a lot of work.

205
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,650
He's done a lot of work on this,

206
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,770
on turning that Kelly Criterion and expanding on it for option trading.

207
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,130
So if you guys want to learn more about it, math is pretty intense.

208
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,050
It's in his book. Okay. So we're going to use this hypothetical example.

209
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,040
Now we're going to say when we win on average. Okay. We're going to use like,

210
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,160
let's say this line. Okay.

211
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,100
So let's say we put on this iron condor and we say when we win,

212
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
we're going to win 500 bucks.

213
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,060
Okay. And when we lose. Okay. We're going to lose. Let's say this is,

214
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,220
I don't know. Let's say our max loss is a thousand.

215
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,920
Okay. Now we know a lot of the probabilities, right?

216
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,460
We know that one standard deviation, 60% of the time, right? 68% of the time.

217
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,440
We're going to, we're going to make money. We're going to be somewhere in here.

218
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,520
Right. And, you know,

219
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,440
I was just talking to Kyle earlier yesterday or something.

220
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:46,500
His hit ratio was 1.29. Okay. So that is almost 68% of the time. Right.

221
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,360
For his earning trades.

222
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,950
So we know that we're going to make money about 68% of the time.

223
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,690
You're going to be somewhere in here. 33% of the time or 32% of the time,

224
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,150
we're going to lose money. Okay. But we're going to lose big, right?

225
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,870
This is just like an earnings trade. We're going to win 500 and we're right.

226
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,330
And we're going to lose a thousand when we're wrong. Okay.

227
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:15,110
So now we have probabilities. Now we have our, our, our PNLs. If we're right,

228
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,090
if we're wrong, and we can throw that into the Kelly criteria.

229
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,410
So we're going to throw it into the Kelly criteria.

230
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,170
Okay. So 0.68.

231
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,660
0.5. Plus one, right? The odds are half for every thousand we lose.

232
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:49,030
We make 500. Minus one over 0.5. 0.68. Times. 1.5. Minus one.

233
00:18:51,080 --> 00:19:02,960
Divided by. 0.5. 1.02. Minus one. Yeah. Over 0.5. 0.04. So in this example,

234
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:11,650
we cannot bet more than 4% of our bankroll. If we bet more than 4%, guess what?

235
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,210
We lose money in the long run. Okay. So I know that's shocking guys.

236
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,790
And this is why we always say, you know, keep it to 5%. Right.

237
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,730
Keep it to 5% for these earnings trades.

238
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,970
And the reason we do 5% is I think we have a little bit higher expectancy here.

239
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,940
Okay. A little bit higher. And our, our win loss is usually not a two to one.

240
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,200
It's usually one to 1.5. So we usually say that 0.05. When you start going,

241
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,040
let's say 10%. 15%. Even though you're in a winning game,

242
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,830
you are going to lose all of your money. Now. You know, you sometimes,

243
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:01,230
you know, you hear Sean, I say. If you find an edge that big. That big. Well,

244
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,280
imagine. We had. 0.80 here. Imagine we had insane confidence, right?

245
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,740
This number right here. This P. This is our confidence level.

246
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,680
How confident are you? If you're confident in trade you,

247
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,140
that means you think it's going to happen.

248
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,360
If you don't think it's going to happen, this P value goes down.

249
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,080
And in trading, if this P value goes down. What happens to be.

250
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,310
What happens to be if you're, if you're making a trade right now.

251
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,410
And P goes down. B has to go up. If you, if peace, okay.

252
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,370
If P is your confidence, if you're, if you're not confident on trade,

253
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,990
what does that mean? It means the risk reward has to be huge.

254
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,410
Otherwise you're not going to take a trade. If you're that's why our one,

255
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,990
three, two flies, for example, we're not confident. Always.

256
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,370
We don't have a directional view, but guess what? This B value is 10 to one.

257
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,440
This B value is 10.

258
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,760
Right? So this is how we start to figure out, well, you know,

259
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,660
how should we make a trade here? What kind of, you know, how,

260
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,860
how can this math right. Integrate into our trading. Into our betting.

261
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,480
At the end of the day, guys, we're betting here. We're we're bets. We're,

262
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,780
we're, we're creating these bets and we have to manage them properly.

263
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,600
It's so important. And perhaps saying, if I bet 271. Instead of two 70.

264
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,440
You go back up in the long run. I know it doesn't say,

265
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,840
I know that might sound crazy for now. Now,

266
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,580
obviously it's not going to look like exactly. Right away. Yes.

267
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,220
It's not gonna happen right away. But in the long run. It's going to happen.

268
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,900
This $1 per nap is going to screw you. Okay. And that is. This is not,

269
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,860
this is not theory. This is not theory. This is math. Okay.

270
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,040
This is what actually happens. You lose in the long run. Betting $1 more.

271
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,140
So guys. Here's the harsh reality. Here's the harsh reality.

272
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:07,620
If your account size is $1,000. And you are doing an earnings trade. Okay.

273
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,020
What does that mean? What does that mean? If your account size is $1,000,

274
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,280
you're doing earnings trade. You can't have a loser. Okay.

275
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,550
Bigger than that.

276
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:29,670
Okay. You cannot have a loser. Bigger than this. Your risk on the trade.

277
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,520
Cannot be bigger than this number. Okay. If you're doing an earnings trade.

278
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,680
Yeah. If you have 5,000. Your max risk. Cannot be 250.

279
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,690
Cannot be bigger than $250. Okay. And what does that mean? Well,

280
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,830
it just means that you can't trade everything right now.

281
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,690
That you can only take certain trades. Okay.

282
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,350
And there's another thing you can do. Is you can create your own strategy.

283
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:05,430
Which either increases P. Increases your confidence. Or increases B.

284
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,230
Increases the risk to reward ratio. Okay. And this number.

285
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,090
So if we actually plug it in with instead of 500 and 1,000.

286
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,110
Let's say we did like 500 and 750 or 600. Which is more realistic.

287
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,530
This number goes up. So 6.66. So in reality, you know, you can't be making.

288
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,170
You can't be putting on the line. More than 60 bucks.

289
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,810
For every $1,000 you have in your account.

290
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,840
Okay. That is. That is the reality of trading. And I know it's hard.

291
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,280
I know sometimes I might be like, holy shit. Like that's crazy.

292
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,780
This is the truth. You know, there's people. There's, you know,

293
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,060
as the saying goes, men lie and women lie. But numbers don't.

294
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,780
Numbers don't lie. Okay.

295
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,300
If you're just flat out doing the earning strategy.

296
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,600
You can't bet more than this.

297
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,820
If you want to create your own strategy around earnings.

298
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,300
If you have a certain idea that, you know. Is going to increase either P or B.

299
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,500
Now you can bet more. And this is not just for earnings.

300
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,970
This is for every strategy out there. Okay.

301
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,700
So now the lecture is over. I'm just going to go and answer some questions.
