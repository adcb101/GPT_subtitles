1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,820
Okay, so today's lecture is going to be on expected value.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,900
So we all talk about expected value.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,460
There's a little bit about it in the bronze course,

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,840
but today we're gonna deep dive into really how expected value plays out,

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,180
what we need to think about,

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,540
how it looks like in different scenarios in the world of trading and even outside

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,410
of the world of trading. So let's hop right into it. Yeah, so as Sean's saying,

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,290
like expected value is everything, right? It's,

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,520
if we have a positive expected value, it means we're playing a winning game,

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,470
means we're making money. So what we're gonna do here,

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,740
and what I did here was I simulated,

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,720
so we're looking at the top left graph over here, guys. Okay,

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:51,880
what I did was I simulated an expected value, okay, with 62% hit rate.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,610
So we win 62% of the time. And when we win, we win a dollar. And when we lose,

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,950
we lose a dollar 50. So risk reward is one to 1.5, 1.5 to one.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,700
And 38% chance we lose, 62% chance we win. Very similar to earnings. Okay,

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,900
obviously it's not perfect, but very similar. So 38% of the time, right here,

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,140
guys, remember, this is our expected value formula.

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,060
Probability of winning times how much we win minus probability of losing times how

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,780
much we lose.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,060
And what we need to really just remember here, guys,

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,960
is what are we trying to really calculate here?

23
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,560
We're trying to calculate if we're supposed to win, right?

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,830
Theoretically, do we come out ahead in a game like this?

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,450
And the things that we need to consider are really two things, right?

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,910
So it's our risk to reward and our probabilities of success, right?

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,890
We can use this to break down blackjack, casino games, all types of betting.

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:59,110
We can use it to break down life and death situations, although it's like,

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,290
if you win, you live. If you lose, you die.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,670
And it's like a 99% chance you live. It's like, you know, but you can use this.

31
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,640
You can really apply this to anything. And why do we do this though,

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,400
is also because we need to see what it looks like to play in a winning game,

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,200
right? Imagine we have no clue what a winning game looks like.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,220
People might think winning game only goes up into the right.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,680
So we need to simulate what does a winning game actually look like?

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,650
And because we can do that, we can get more understanding, right?

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,050
So we are gonna simulate a winning game. And in fact,

38
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,830
our expected value is 5 cents for every dollar we bet.

39
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,180
So every time I go bet a dollar, I'm gonna make 5 cents on average. Okay,

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,320
so that is our edge here. And just let's stop on that for one second,

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,640
because let's think about it. In a game where you either win one or lose 1.5,

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,880
how the hell do you make 5 cents? Well, what you do is,

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,080
you have to look at it in the long run, right? So for example,

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,600
62% of the time, you're gonna win one, 38% of the time, you're gonna lose 1.5.

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,920
If you average that out over a long, long time, on average per hand,

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,120
so if you took your total return and divided it by the number of games you played,

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,000
you would get 5 cents plus 5 cents. So on average, you made 5 cents per game,

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,220
but on each individual game, you either went plus one or negative 1.5.

49
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,310
So we're actually gonna play one game here. Okay,

50
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,790
we're gonna play one game 10 times.

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,840
So one player is gonna play this game 10 times. Okay,

52
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
so we have a 5 cent edge for every dollar we bet. So we're gonna play it.

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
So we're gonna play this game 10 times, okay?

54
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,900
And one player, okay? And this is what happens. So you can see,

55
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,920
we- Started with a little loss. We lost $1.80, right? We started out zero.

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,600
Or sorry, $1.50. Our first bet, we went down to negative $1.50.

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,520
Then we lost another $1.50. Okay, so now we're at $3. This is the second hand.

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,240
Then third hand, we made $1.00. Fourth hand, we made $1.00.

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
It kept going up and up and up and up and up. Then we lost one couple,

60
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,180
lost a couple, okay? And we ended up being down negative $2.00. Okay,

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,860
let's run it again.

62
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,260
Do you guys understand what's going on here? Yeah, if not,

63
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,800
we'll stop and play again. Okay, so look at this, guys. In this situation,

64
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,360
okay? We won twice in a row, right? We went from $1.00, then $2.00.

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,460
We won $1.00 and $1.00, right? Every time we win, we get $1.00.

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,800
And then we went on this really bad losing streak. Got smoked. Got smoked.

67
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,510
So do you guys get this so far? So far, we're good.

68
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,190
If you looked at this return, what would you think?

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,080
If all you looked at was the outcome, good or bad strategy? Yeah, dookie,

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,380
bad strategy, right? You look at that P&L graph, you go,

71
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
I don't want my P&L graph to look like that.

72
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,880
I don't wanna do what this guy's doing. But this is a winning game.

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,560
This is a winning game. You're in a winning,

74
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,130
you're playing a winning game here. Okay, so let's actually do that again.

75
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,490
Let's take it a little step further. Okay,

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,080
what we're gonna do actually is we're going to play this game 100 times.

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,400
We're gonna play this game 100 times,

78
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,140
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna have 10 people play this game.

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,080
So I think we have a little more than 10 guys on the live here.

80
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,480
So just imagine everyone, we'll do 11 because we have 11 of you on the live.

81
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,210
All of us play this game. And we play this game, we do 100 trades, okay?

82
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,270
So every time this trade comes up, we do it.

83
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,210
And we actually are able to place 100 trades, every person on this live here,

84
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,060
okay? So let's actually see what happens now.

85
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,650
Okay, look at this. So about half of us make money.

86
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,150
Each of these lines is a different player. Yeah,

87
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,130
so each of these lines is a different player. So for example,

88
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,050
this orange line here is Codemaster.

89
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,030
And then obviously this yellow line down here is either- That's Parker. Yeah,

90
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,830
it's either- It's Neil or Parker. Or Kyle too. Or it could be Kyle. Oh,

91
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,850
it's probably Kyle. It's most likely Kyle.

92
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,350
Okay, so each one of these is a different line. But what is this telling us?

93
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,610
What is this telling us here? What can we infer here, right?

94
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,950
And why can we actually joke about it being Kyle? Because that's luck.

95
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,920
It's unlucky that Kyle got, he's the one that got fucked, right?

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,280
That's why they say in trading, there's a lot of luck, right?

97
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,830
There's a lot of noise and very small signal. So this game has a lot of luck.

98
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,530
And, you know, so let's say 100 trades, this is half an earning season, okay?

99
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,830
Now let's actually bump this up. Let's play this game.

100
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,950
Let's play this game for two earning seasons.

101
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,140
So we've got 11 of us here, okay? Play the whole earning season.

102
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,060
Play the whole earning season.

103
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,200
Come on, brown line. Okay,

104
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,350
now take a look at this. Four of us get absolutely loaded, okay?

105
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,110
Four of us actually make 40,

106
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,700
we start off with a dollar and we end up with 40 bucks. Okay,

107
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,540
some of us actually hit 50 bucks. So some of us get rich.

108
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,410
On the other hand, some of us, another four of us lose. Actually two,

109
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,570
two lose a lot. A few of them are floating around break even, right?

110
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,570
This guy does okay. He does 10 times, 10 times better than me.

111
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,480
10 times is money, right? It's pretty good. You know, this guy breaks even,

112
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,060
this guy breaks even, but two of us lose a little bit of money, okay?

113
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,240
We go in debt. So this is half an earning season. Sorry, this is two quarters.

114
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,640
Now, if we did a full year cycle, okay?

115
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,950
We did a full year on a strategy that has a 5% edge, okay?

116
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,620
Very similar to earnings. Very, very similar to earnings,

117
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,440
okay? Almost all of us make money here and we're all playing the same game.

118
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,840
Every single one of us is playing the same game.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,320
Some of us get absolutely rich, right? We're just- A hundred times your money.

120
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,830
A hundred times our money. But some of us get extremely, extremely wealthy.

121
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,420
On the flip side, some of us get unlucky. And look, in this case,

122
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,960
brown lines at the top. Kyle comes from being the underdog to top dog.

123
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,300
Now look at what's happening over here, guys.

124
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,430
Look at what's happening in the first 100 hands, okay? It's really noise.

125
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,850
It's really noise. And a lot of us are floating around break even here.

126
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,370
And we can say as well that these guys that are up here are higher than average.

127
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,050
They got more than what was made, right?

128
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,670
Maybe we're only supposed to be around here. This is our expected value, right?

129
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,140
Is maybe to be up 10 hands or 10 times our money or 15 times our money.

130
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,840
But people are all the way up here. Other guys are down here.

131
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
And obviously you guys are gonna see that if we increase this number, right?

132
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Everybody makes money. Every single one of us is gonna make money.

133
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,670
Just give it a second to load. It usually takes a little while.

134
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,450
Because we're running quite a bit of hands here, right?

135
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,670
We're running basically a life cycle of earnings. You know,

136
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,570
earnings until five, 10 years of earnings.

137
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,020
It's just gonna take a second here to load, guys.

138
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,080
Just a little sludge break.

139
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,310
Can't believe I drank a whole stein of this garbage.

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,060
Well, there we go, right? Everybody makes money, okay? But in the short run.

141
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,180
Doesn't always happen that way. Doesn't always happen, right?

142
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,780
And this is why it's sometimes hard to stay with a strategy even though it's a winning

143
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,600
game, right? Like for example, if I told you guys for certain, I said, hey,

144
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,460
let's play a game. And we're gonna play this game exactly.

145
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,660
None of you would say no to it. None of you. And if you do,

146
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,700
there's something wrong. You're not understanding probabilities.

147
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,430
You're not understanding expected value. However,

148
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,830
it doesn't mean you're gonna come out right away a winner.

149
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,840
Even in the short run. It takes a while for edges to play out.

150
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,840
And if we have a bad earnings season like we had now, like we had last quarter,

151
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,920
it wasn't a great season, that's for sure, right? Tons of blowouts.

152
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,680
That's gonna affect our P&L, right? The quarter before that was unreal.

153
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,600
It was an unreal quarter.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,720
And this is why simulating these games where we actually know for certain,

155
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
for a hundred percent certainty, we should come out a winner.

156
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:30,920
We even at some point come out losers, right? In a full earnings season,

157
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,860
two of us here lost, right? Three of us here lost.

158
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,420
And two of us came out breakeven, just a little bit better than breakeven.

159
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,580
But it doesn't make it a bad game, right? It doesn't make it a bad game.

160
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
You're still playing a winning game.

161
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
And now what we need to really think about, right?

162
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,710
So what this really paints a picture of guys is that you can't just look at the

163
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,770
outcome. The outcome matters. If you're not making money,

164
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,940
you need to be on top of things. But what do you need to be on top of, right?

165
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,540
That's the real question here is, do you need to be on top of like, oh,

166
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,460
my psychology? Do you need to be on top of, you know, I missed the breakout.

167
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,780
It was actually, it was a false breakout.

168
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,900
What do you really need to be on top of here?

169
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,760
What you need to be on top of is your expected value. Is there still edge?

170
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,480
Do you still actually have an edge in this game? Is this still a winning game?

171
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,990
So you look at things like at a surface level,

172
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,880
your risk reward and your probabilities of success.

173
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,220
What is your confidence in this trade? Where is that coming from? Right,

174
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,920
the most important thing is to really,

175
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:40,090
really know what goes into your expected value. Why like, so for example,

176
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,190
in this equation, if you look up here, we put in a 62% chance of winning.

177
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,230
It's hard to find a game that has a 62% chance of winning. Right,

178
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,010
but what we balanced it with, right? Because earnings is maybe close to that.

179
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,330
We balanced it with a one reward, 1.5 risk.

180
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,030
So you lose more when you lose than you make when you win. Right,

181
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,750
and this is how you'll typically see it play out.

182
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,610
If there's a huge probability of winning, right?

183
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,710
So you can go and sell out of the money it puts. You'll have an 85, 90,

184
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,530
95% hit rate, but your risk reward is like one to a hundred, right?

185
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,350
When it does blow out, you lose it all. And when you plug those numbers in,

186
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,250
you find out you have a negative,

187
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,550
or only maybe very slightly positive expected value with blow up potential,

188
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,880
right? So that's how we really want you guys thinking about this.

189
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,980
This is how a professional trader looks at this game. They don't just look,

190
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:43,380
you know, go back to running it, like run it out like a hundred times. Right,

191
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,920
or just copy the whole thing down. Yeah. This one here? Yeah, all the way down.

192
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,660
Look at me guys, I'm coding now, right? If you just see this, right?

193
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,660
Or if we do, do I just change this to a one? For what?

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,200
If I just want one player? Yeah, just take away this. Okay.

195
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,700
Let me just run this one more time, guys.

196
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,950
We can just run this one actually right here. Yeah, just like that line. Okay,

197
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,840
yeah. Oh yeah, I see what you mean. Right, if you see this,

198
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,560
looks like a bad game. Someone shows you this, it's awful.

199
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,380
Remember we told you about the guy in that Tasty Trade group,

200
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,800
what was his name? Denny, not Denny, the one with the post COVID journal.

201
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,460
Oh yeah, Daniel Sung. Yeah, Daniel Sung. He was a rising star on Tasty Trade.

202
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,440
He was big in this Facebook group we were in.

203
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,480
He was keeping a trade journal post COVID where he was selling zero day to expiration

204
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,960
out of the money options and collecting pennies.

205
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,370
Why did he have to do post COVID?

206
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,970
Because the reason he had to do post COVID is he was playing a game with negative

207
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,770
expected value.

208
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,010
And when COVID happened and we had that huge downturn in the market,

209
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,010
he lost his shirt. So now he needs to sell courses to get his shirt back.

210
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,960
But that's why we can't just look at a snapshot.

211
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,740
What he's showing there is a snapshot where it does well.

212
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,500
The market is only going up right now.

213
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,200
Selling puts makes money or would have made money historically over the last five

214
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,380
months or 10 years. Yeah, but because we never had a down day.

215
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,240
But what you're getting there is, the way we can think about it, guys,

216
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,840
is like this. If I change this to 10,000 plays, let's say.

217
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,780
You wanna do the one guy? Can I just run this whole thing? Yeah, that's good.

218
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,530
Right? So let's say that this is the graph here. What Denny did,

219
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,270
let's say is this.

220
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,330
He showed you this. Why is it such an ugly color?

221
00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:03,220
What these guys are doing is they're showing you this. Right? Look how it did,

222
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,770
but they're not showing you this. But as sophisticated traders,

223
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,970
we need to look at the whole picture. We need to ask these tough questions.

224
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,700
You know, we gotta think about it. And if we only look at a small sample size,

225
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,220
right? Let's say this is 100 trades.

226
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,400
And let's say this is 100 trades. Well,

227
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,640
two very different pictures of the same game. What do you believe?

228
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,210
And this is why we can't just look at this. We can't just look at the chart.

229
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,760
We can't just look at our outcome. Because you see number one,

230
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,470
and you think it's the worst strategy in the world. You see number two,

231
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,190
and you think you're gonna be Jeff Bezos next year. When in reality,

232
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,970
when you look at up here, when you look at all this,

233
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,170
when you look at the code that goes into it,

234
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,230
when you look at the expected value,

235
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,550
instead of when you look at what the game really is,

236
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,130
rather than just what the outcome has been, you can say,

237
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,280
this is a game I wanna play. This is a game where I'm supposed to make money.

238
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,930
That's the way we need to be thinking about our trades.

239
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,150
Am I supposed to make money here? Given my risk to reward,

240
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,970
given my confidence in the trade, what the hell is my outcome supposed to be?

241
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,990
Am I supposed to make money?

242
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,020
And that's why it's so important to understand why you should make money,

243
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,600
right? Why should we make money selling vol on earnings? Well,

244
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,440
if we didn't make money selling vol on earnings,

245
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,320
that would mean buying vol around earnings,

246
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,120
which would make it an unbelievable trade. Because remember guys,

247
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,040
if you can diversify a long vol strategy that makes money,

248
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,660
you have the holy grail, because everything is a max risk.

249
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,500
And if you can diversify that max risk, you can make a ton of money,

250
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,180
ton of money. Now, should the market pay you for that?

251
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:54,220
Does it make sense theoretically, right? It doesn't, like everyone would do it.

252
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Then the other thing is, well, whose money are we eating here?

253
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,420
Whose lunch are we eating here? Who's gonna be buying these options? Well,

254
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,100
if retail traders are predominantly long options,

255
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,100
if hedge funds are predominantly long options, if you can't,

256
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,520
if the barrier to entry for selling options is higher than the barrier to entry

257
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,460
for buying options,

258
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,280
it doesn't make sense that buying options around earnings should make money.

259
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,180
It doesn't make sense. And if it did make sense,

260
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,540
we'd all be rich extremely quickly, because we can leverage.

261
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,630
We can leverage on a long vol strat. We can't leverage on a short vol strat,

262
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,970
okay? So we have to think about that, but guys, we will go through drawdowns.

263
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,100
We just came off an amazing quarter. It only makes sense. You know,

264
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,500
Neil's on this live. You guys can ask Neil.

265
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,160
Every single trade Neil put on last quarter was a winner, right?

266
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,870
So it's tough. Like even that guy that I showed you, that Kay Seidel,

267
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250
he did his first earnings season last quarter, and it was amazing.

268
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,390
It was amazing. He hyped it up, talked to his group, posted it everywhere.

269
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,820
And then this quarter, he went ghost. He went silent, okay?

270
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,500
And we all know the reason, right? He doesn't buy wings. He was selling vol,

271
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,900
and he got absolutely crushed,

272
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,350
okay? Oh, sorry, it wasn't Kay Seidel, actually.

273
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,590
It was the other guy from MacroOps, MacroOptions or whatever. Okay,

274
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,930
so now that we have that,

275
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,930
a couple of questions here in the group we're gonna chat about.

276
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,560
So Renato, you're asking us to run it with a one-to-one risk to reward.

277
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:48,220
So- Sorry, I'm struggling. Neil, I've done about 5,000 trades over about three,

278
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,660
four years. Renato wants us to run it with a one-to-one risk to reward.

279
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,400
So here's the thing. We can do that. You can just click clear. Okay.

280
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,420
We can do that. It's gonna be skewed though,

281
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,080
because the odds of you finding something with a one-to-one risk reward where you

282
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,360
have a 62% chance of winning is gonna be really hard.

283
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,920
And we're gonna show you what your expected value is for that, right?

284
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,300
You'll see why it'll be really hard. Yeah, so let's put this in. Okay,

285
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
so every time we're gonna win 62% of the time,

286
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,520
our risk reward is gonna be one-to-one and we're gonna lose 30% of the time.

287
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,180
Well, that makes our expected value 24 cents for every dollar you bet.

288
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:28,800
So imagine you bet $10,000. On average, you should make $2,400 per trade.

289
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,600
Even if you lose 10,000, on average, your expected value is 2,400 per trade.

290
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,820
So let's go and run that. So we're gonna run that just 100 times. Okay,

291
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,220
and we're gonna have the same 11 guys here. Maybe there's 12 now. There's 13.

292
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,060
So all of us are gonna play this game.

293
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,760
Better luck this time, Kyle. Well, you guys are gonna do great, right? Kyle,

294
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,760
you're okay. Kyle is taking the brown color. I'll take the dark blue line.

295
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,320
Jordan, who are you? Okay, I'm gonna do green. I'm gonna do dark green,

296
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,420
light green, dark green. Okay, Neil's the light purple line.

297
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,990
Andreas is the yellow line.

298
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
Look at that. Just in 100 games,

299
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,960
everybody makes not just a little bit of money. Look at this.

300
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:27,100
Some guys made 50 times their money in just 100 games. You and Kyle. Yeah,

301
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,140
that's right. That's right, buddy. We're back on top, right?

302
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,130
That's next earning season. But look what happened, guys. In the short run,

303
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,660
look what happened in the first 25 hands, right? Actually,

304
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,100
even the first 40 hands, right?

305
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,680
Two guys here were losing money in a game that was like you're never gonna find

306
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,240
anywhere. They were still losing money in the first 40 hands. Okay,

307
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,500
so- Is this only 100 hands? This is 100 hands. Everyone got rich.

308
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,020
Everyone made money, right? So with these- Wait,

309
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,200
can we change it to one-to-one? Yeah. So here's an example, guys. You know,

310
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,860
and this is obviously not for the more advanced guys.

311
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,540
I know you guys already know your shit, but for the newer guys here,

312
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,280
that's why when you see someone come and say, hey, listen,

313
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,900
I have a 90% hit rate with a one-to-one,

314
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,020
let's actually run that and you guys will see. Okay, so we're gonna go.

315
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,280
Unless his name is Jeff and his last name is Bezos. Okay, so 90% hit rate.

316
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,060
Okay, imagine we had a 90% hit rate, one-to-one risk reward.

317
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,850
You actually, no one in this group even went through a drawdown.

318
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,710
So if someone's saying, listen, I do a 90% hit rate, one-to-one risk reward.

319
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,090
You only need to do five trades for you to say, is this guy legit?

320
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,110
Only five trades. So for example,

321
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,930
if you're in Aristotle's group and Aristotle's claiming, I don't know,

322
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,750
even 85% or 90%, whatever it is, with two-to-one risk reward,

323
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,060
then you only have to take his trades two times, three times in order to say,

324
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,740
okay, is he legit or not? If you are losing money after two or three trades,

325
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,790
he's not legit. He's lying to you, right?

326
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,490
And these are just quick- It's just numbers. It's just numbers, right?

327
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,590
They always say men lie, women lie, numbers don't, okay? This is just,

328
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,010
you can just say, hey, listen, Aristotle,

329
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,130
you say you have 90% hit rate with a one-to-one risk reward.

330
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,420
Why is it after 10 trades, I'm down 30% of my account? Well,

331
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,940
you know what he's gonna say. Risk management. Yeah, mentality, psychology,

332
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,140
risk management. You got greedy. You got greedy, right? It's not,

333
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,380
you should never lose ever if you can find that kind of money.

334
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,760
Like you could put a monkey in front of the computer and just tell it they hit the

335
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
button and you should make money.

336
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,190
And the reason why these games actually don't exist, okay,

337
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,120
is because if they did exist, someone would take advantage of it. Now,

338
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,880
I don't wanna say they don't exist because they do,

339
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,340
but they do where the barrier to entry is extremely high. For example,

340
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,390
insurance. Insurance, you and I can't go and start up an insurance company.

341
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,110
We can't do it. Sean, can you go start an insurance company tomorrow? We can.

342
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,490
Yeah, we can't go do it, right? We can't go and start up a bank.

343
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,090
We can't go and do these things where the premiums are extremely expensive relative

344
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,010
to the payouts.

345
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,360
However, anyone can open up a brokerage account.

346
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,200
Anyone can go and look at a chart.

347
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,660
Anyone can go and start selling vol around earnings. Well, not anyone,

348
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,750
but a lot of people. Anyone can go and buy vol around earnings.

349
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,800
So for that reason, if there was a strategy that was extremely profitable,

350
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,780
remember, we're living in a world of competition.

351
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,720
We're living in a world where you are playing against extremely smart people,

352
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,260
not just the people in Aristotle Group, not just Sean and I.

353
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,620
You're playing against- Ewan Sinclair. Ewan Sinclair, Aaron Brown, right?

354
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,730
Firms. And if they have, let's say,

355
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,330
20 guys that come into a room every single day and say, hey, listen,

356
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,630
let's test this strategy, right? So for that reason,

357
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,630
you're never gonna find something that is a huge expected value.

358
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,980
But that doesn't mean you can't get rich. Big difference.

359
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,620
You don't need a huge expected value. Exactly. You just need unexpected value,

360
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,980
a positive one. It's like what Aaron Brown says. Aaron Brown says,

361
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,270
if you wanna get rich, all you need is a 3% edge. That's it.

362
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,250
But people don't look at that and they spend their whole time looking for these

363
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,170
strategies that have a 80% win rate, a 75% win rate, a 90% win rate,

364
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,110
and they never end up making it because they were looking too far ahead.

365
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,970
They're being too ahead of themselves.

366
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,400
It's like, what's another example we can use for that? Like, it's like,

367
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,300
look at even in the world of business these days,

368
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,420
most of the new tech that you see coming out is incremental changes to what already

369
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,140
exists. It's not every,

370
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,540
you don't need to always search for the blow out of the water,

371
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,990
the fucking lottery ticket, right?

372
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,550
There's money to be made in incremental things and very,

373
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,660
very small edges and very small changes. You know what I mean? Yeah,

374
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,560
and I think Stephen had a really good point here as well. He's like,

375
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,640
remember guys, when oil was negative $20 a barrel,

376
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,120
Sean and I couldn't go into the barrel yard and say, hey, give me some oil.

377
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:34,340
I wanna put a thousand barrels of oil in my backyard in our little 300 square foot

378
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,780
balcony, right? We can't do that. We can't do that.

379
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,780
So that's a huge barrier to entry. We should have bought some barrels, dude.

380
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,020
I mean, I think they do like a thousand barrels.

381
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,900
You have to buy a thousand barrels. That's one contract.

382
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,460
So Sean and I can't go and do that.

383
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,600
You guys can't go and do that. You're gonna have a storing facility.

384
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,980
You gotta be able to, whatever the whole process is, I have no clue,

385
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,460
but it's a high barrier to entry.

386
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,760
So the people that can do it and store it will get paid for it.

387
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,420
And those are extremely profitable plays, right? But we don't need that.

388
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,600
We don't need that to get rich. And also guys,

389
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,480
those people that are doing it have a business, they have employees,

390
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,380
they have overhead, they have a ton of overhead, right?

391
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,260
You wanna keep your overhead low and just find a small edge and play it over the

392
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,700
long run. And most importantly, understand your edge.

393
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,300
If you don't understand your edge,

394
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,260
how the hell are you gonna live through a drawdown?

395
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,660
If I wasn't saying to you guys, guys, listen,

396
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,680
selling vol around earnings events has a long-term positive expected value.

397
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,160
You guys would have given up. A lot of you would have given up, right?

398
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,540
It's one thing you can do is reduce your risk, right? I know,

399
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,160
I always talked to Neil about this when he was starting out with us.

400
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,030
You can't just have a $5,000 count in trade earnings because it's hard,

401
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,590
it's really difficult, right? You have to go to smaller names.

402
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,050
You gotta really work your way up there.

403
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,130
You gotta go really small and work your way up.

404
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,840
But that's hard because a lot of the companies are $150 stocks, right?

405
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,440
So remember, another thing about having your expected value play out,

406
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,060
the most important thing actually,

407
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,740
after finding a positive expected value game is managing your risk.

408
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,380
And that's the whole Kelly Criterion thing we talked about. Right,

409
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,760
so even if we're playing a game,

410
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,260
like let's say earnings that has a winning expected value,

411
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,540
but our risk is too big, you're gonna end up losing. So this is what makes,

412
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,760
for example, selling earnings a little bit difficult.

413
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,540
It's a little harder for the average person.

414
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,880
But buying a vol around earnings is easy.

415
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,540
So when you guys build out these strategies,

416
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,980
you really have to think these through, okay? Why should I make money here?

417
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:48,100
The first thing. Then obviously, if you can test it, that's very important.

418
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,280
But even more importantly, is understand why the edge is there.

419
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,970
Then build out a risk structure where it's like, okay, well,

420
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,590
this is how much risk I have to take per trade. If I go any bigger than this,

421
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,810
I'm gonna make money. And a good rule of thumb is,

422
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,050
if you don't know how much risk you should be betting, bet small.

423
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,960
If you don't know how much risk you should be playing, bet small.

424
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,240
I can't say that enough, okay, guys?

425
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,750
Exactly. Actually, negative gamma. I had no clue that Lotto Max was plus EV.

426
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,310
I'd actually love to hear that, because I'd like to go- Buy some tickets. Yeah,

427
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,210
have some fun with it, man. If you want to post it in Trader's Chat,

428
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,320
that'd be sweet, dude. Nice little trade we'll have going here.

429
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,630
You know, it's- I'm on a 15-year drawdown,

430
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,500
but I have a positive expected value. But you're gonna hit it.

431
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm gonna hit one day. Yeah. And it's funny,

432
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,820
because even when you have a positive expected value in a game like that,

433
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,880
you might even go your whole life without hitting it, right?

434
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,100
But you only have to hit it once. But you only have to hit it once.

435
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,500
So all of a sudden, it's positive. Yeah, and we have 12 guys playing that game,

436
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,840
right? As you guys saw,

437
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,360
some people actually make money and some people lose money.

438
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,220
And you can't look at the guy and be like, you're better than me,

439
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,320
you're smarter than me, because they're playing the same game.

440
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,740
They're doing the same thing. That's why there's so much luck.

441
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,820
And if you talk to any- I'm sure you guys have heard this many times.

442
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,420
If you talk to anyone who's made a lot of money in the world,

443
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,920
they'll tell you a lot of it was luck, right? You need the skill.

444
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,780
There's no question.

445
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,860
No one's gonna get extremely rich without putting in skill,

446
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,560
unless they hit the lottery, or they inherited it.

447
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,660
But if you wanna go from nothing to something and work your way up,

448
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,780
you need that skill. But there's a lot of luck along the way.

449
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,780
You met the right person at the right time.

450
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,450
A good deal came up at the right time,

451
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,210
which gave you your first boost to get into the game. Yeah,

452
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,510
but you had the skill to recognize the deal. Yeah, exactly.

453
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,930
It's like, there's a saying about luck. It's like- I just dropped my water.

454
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,180
What is it? It's like,

455
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,030
being lucky is opening yourself up to luck and putting yourself in a position for

456
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,630
lucky things to happen, right? So for example,

457
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,950
everyone else saw the deal that was a good deal that showed up.

458
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,230
You're the one who took it, but you didn't take it because you're Joe Schmo.

459
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,870
You took it because you studied whatever industry that is.

460
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,170
Yeah, exactly. Dylan, exactly, man. Luck is nothing more than preparation,

461
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,010
meeting opportunity. Exactly. That's exactly what I was trying to say, man.

462
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,560
And you know you're prepared when your expected value is positive.

463
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,290
Amply prepared. Yeah.

464
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,330
I hope you guys got some insight there in strategy development and what reality

465
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,730
actually looks like, what rich actually looks like.

466
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,330
So I'm just gonna quickly do it again, guys. If you can find,

467
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,170
so if you can find a strategy, let's say, where you can trade on a daily basis.

468
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,990
So we'll actually have some fun and go through a couple of strategies.

469
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,630
If you can find a strategy that you can trade,

470
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,110
let's say like a Delta One product,

471
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,650
like a stock product or a Forex pair or whatever,

472
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,710
let's say you can trade on a daily timeframe. Actually, let's go,

473
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,930
let's have some more fun because I know there's a couple of scalpers here.

474
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,240
Let's say you can trade 10 times a day. So in one year,

475
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,030
3,650 trades. Okay, actually, sorry, 2,500 trades, one year. Okay, one year.

476
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,830
Okay, and let's say 60, 40,

477
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,950
one-to-one, one-to-one, 60, 40.

478
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,060
Okay, and this is what a lot of us,

479
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,470
this is what a lot of us are used to when we first get into trading. All right,

480
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,170
this seems reasonable. Hey, you know what? I'm 60% right, no problem.

481
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,310
One-to-one risk reward. Easy, easy. It's easy.

482
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,530
I can trade this on a daily timeframe, scalping some pips. This makes sense.

483
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,770
This makes a lot of sense to me.

484
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,820
So look at this. Everyone makes money in one year. Everybody. You should make,

485
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,140
and most people make between 2,000 and 3,000%. Yeah.

486
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,150
Most people make 20 times their money in one year. That's the average.

487
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,660
20 times the money in one year. So we need to ask ourselves this question,

488
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:29,900
right?

489
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,360
If some of you out there are scalping pips,

490
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,070
and let's say you had a long period of time.

491
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,490
Let's say you've been doing this for three months.

492
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,020
You need to really ask yourself, why is my expected value not showing?

493
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,640
Why is it not making me money? Okay? Because this seems realistic.

494
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm gonna win 60% of the time. I'm gonna lose 40% of the time. Right?

495
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,420
I'm more right than I'm wrong most of the time. Right? You know,

496
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,170
it's just a little bit, I'm just a little bit smarter than being wrong. Right?

497
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:11,330
I'm just a little bit better than 50%. Well, and you can see right here, right?

498
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:18,420
You should never be losing after a year. Right? And you can actually see after,

499
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,250
oh, you know what? This is actually, guys, this is only a hundred games.

500
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,110
This is only a hundred games. This is only 10 days of trading.

501
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,890
I forgot to run it here.

502
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,440
Look at this. You make 600 times your money.

503
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,600
Okay? You make 600 times your money running it for one year.

504
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,800
So we really gotta ask ourselves, does this make sense? So important,

505
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,440
so critical, so critical. These are the reasons why these trades don't exist.

506
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:04,010
No, sorry. They do exist, but you're rarely gonna be able to act on them. Okay?

507
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,270
You're rarely gonna be able to act on them. High barrier to entry, for example.

508
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,590
Dude, I was running it a hundred, I did a hundred times.

509
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,810
This is what happened when I did a whole year.

510
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,980
Oh, so you make 600 times your money. 600 times your money. One to- One to one,

511
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:25,520
60, 40. Okay. Okay, so what do you guys think about that? Yeah,

512
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,800
what do you guys think about this? Because this is something, I know,

513
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,320
at least for me, when I was first started trading, 60, 40, one to one,

514
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,300
that seemed super doable. It seems super doable. Super doable.

515
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,580
So what do you guys think about this? Like, are we crazy?

516
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,160
What do you guys think? I wanna know your opinion, your real authentic opinion,

517
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,460
because we gotta talk about it. We got 20 minutes left on the live.

518
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,090
We got a whole group here of guys who are passionate about trading, you know?

519
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,850
And a lot of people think 60, 40 is real. It's realistic. So let's,

520
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,110
one to one risk reward. So let's talk about it. Let's get it out in the open.

521
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,250
And I'm gonna actually end the live, the recording here. Okay.
