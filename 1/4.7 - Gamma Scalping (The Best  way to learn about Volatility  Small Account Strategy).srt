1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,320
So everyone, on tonight's live, we wanted to, you know,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,720
Jordan and I spent some time thinking about it, and we thought of a way that,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,760
if you have a small account, I shared with you guys a couple of weeks ago,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,580
my small account challenge, where I said, you know,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,500
the way I grew an account from, you know,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,460
a couple thousand bucks to a couple bigger thousand bucks, you know,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,960
from three to eight was by taking really high conviction trades,

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,840
putting a ton of risk on the table, cutting losers short, letting winners run.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,130
And it's a good strategy. It's a good strategy, but to really, you know,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,520
if you're fresh into the options game, or, you know, like, you know,

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,720
maybe a couple months in, you're not gonna learn a ton doing that,

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,660
and you're not gonna be finding those trades yourself. Right,

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,680
a lot of those trades that are high enough conviction that you would be doing that

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,040
would come from the group. So it's not necessarily like, sure,

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,660
you might make some money today,

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,120
but you're not building yourself into the person that makes money for a long time.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,210
And that's, what you get that from is by trading a lot,

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,050
by finding your own ideas and then trading them with frequency.

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,120
The problem with that is that you have to pay to play, right,

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,060
trading costs money. You pay commissions, you pay the spread.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,320
And if you're trading, you know, a $2,000 account, let's say,

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,540
you're gonna get eaten alive by those commissions. So what can you do to learn?

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,130
What can you do to make money and learn?

24
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,770
And that is what we are gonna talk about on today's live. It's a top,

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,790
it's actually a silver topic, but I think, and Jordan will talk about this,

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,600
we might bump this down a bit because I think it's so valuable.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Tonight's topic is Gamma Scalping and Delta Hedging and particularly Gamma Scalping

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,460
as an actual account strategy.

29
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,480
Any intro comments, Jordan? No, I think it's, I guess, actually, intro comment.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
This is actually how I learned.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,740
So when I first started trading, just to give super quick background there,

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,800
when I first started into options,

33
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,860
the way that I learned was by buying straddles, so right off the bat,

34
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,830
limited risk, okay, buying straddles and Gamma Scalping.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
That was the way I learned, right? At the end of the day,

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,060
if you don't have money on the table, it's hard to be motivated to learn.

37
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,950
You don't really learn the nuances, like spreads, like commissions,

38
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,740
like drawdowns, right? Like market impact. Risks, Greeks. Exactly,

39
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,180
and so the cheapest way,

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,740
the cheapest way to learn this is try to find under priced vol,

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,220
buy straddles and Delta Hedging or Gamma Scalping.

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,220
And I would go on the Bloomberg Terminal every day, scan, like,

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,360
so this is maybe four years ago,

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,340
scan for stocks that were cheap in terms of volatility.

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,420
This might be buying stuff into earnings.

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,680
You guys can reach out to Pulumi about this as well.

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,240
We spent a lot of time on it. Buying stuff below its first quantile. Yeah,

48
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,860
just buying something that I thought was cheap. And then Delta Hedges, right?

49
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,680
And this is probably the cheapest way to learn options, in my opinion.

50
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,570
And you can make money. And you can make, I mean, hey,

51
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,690
there's nothing better than you wake up in the morning and the stocks move 10%,

52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,010
right? It's anti-fragile.

53
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,090
And we're in an environment now where vol's maybe picking up a little bit,

54
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,580
starting, you can feel some stuff boiling. Well,

55
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,480
Gamma Scalping might not be a bad thing.

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,380
So the beauty about long convexity is you're never gonna wake up in the morning

57
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,800
and say, shit, you know? That's what we wake up in the morning and say.

58
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,070
Exactly, exactly. Most of the time you're gonna wake up in the morning and say,

59
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,250
well, whatever, right? But sometimes you're gonna wake up in the morning,

60
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,430
holy cow,

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,180
right? So it's the best way, in my opinion, to learn. Learn options, you know,

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,870
and also make some money. And what's really cool about it,

63
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,910
so it involves buying and selling shares. In the US,

64
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,120
you can trade shares for free, right?

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,240
So you get to save a good bit of money on those commissions. Whereas in Canada,

66
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,300
like even with IBKR, you pay a small fee for shares, right? Yeah, dude,

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,260
you're always paying. Pay like a buck, right? Yeah, a buck, yeah. Minimum.

68
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,120
Right, so you don't have to pay that. Yeah, Marcos, but we're in Canada.

69
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,980
Thinkorswim's five bucks in and out. It's crazy. And sure,

70
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,620
like I think it's actually probably the best way, the best intro into vol. So,

71
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,310
you know, I'm really happy Marcos just posted there. Like sometimes it's,

72
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,080
you know, and just from like what I know from Marcos, he's very, you know,

73
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,200
he's got some good alpha in the directional space.

74
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,390
But getting into vol sometimes, it might be a little tricky, right? Especially,

75
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,970
you know, you see Sean and I always talking about being short convexity.

76
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,180
If you decide to buy volatility, right, which everyone can do,

77
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,410
and Delta hedge that, it's,

78
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,070
I think it's a super good introduction to trading volatility.

79
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,970
So let's start this off with, what is gamma scalping? Okay, yeah,

80
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,630
maybe we'll start with gamma scalping. Okay,

81
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,030
we'll talk about gamma scalping and then we'll just do a quick PA scan and then

82
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,790
run a strategy. Yeah, yeah, it's like, you know,

83
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,410
not everyone here will be familiar with that as a strategy, right?

84
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,270
So let's talk about first actually, what is gamma?

85
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,810
So gamma is basically the rate of change of Delta, right?

86
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,710
So how much your Delta is gonna change for every dollar move in the stock price.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,580
So, okay, just to make it like as simple as possible.

88
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:10,180
So your Delta is your exposure to the stock price. Yes.

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,030
How much money your option makes or loses as the stock itself moves. Correct.

90
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:23,960
And what gamma is, is your sensitivity to, so the, let's say this, you know,

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,080
if the stock moves $1, you get paid $1, let's say.

92
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,510
But if the stock keeps moving that way and starts to move quicker, well,

93
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,560
you're gonna actually get paid out more. And that's the gamma effect. Correct.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,660
So gamma is that rate of change in how much you get paid for the stock moving.

95
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,880
So basically the difference between the stock moving like 1%, 1%,

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,840
1% versus like a 5% on the last day, right?

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,260
The pay off of that one move is different. Right,

98
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,360
think about buying a way out of the money call option. You think about Tesla,

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:07,200
you buy a $2,000 call option and expiring tomorrow, expiring tomorrow. Well,

100
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,960
if the stock moves up a hundred bucks today from 800 to 900,

101
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,730
you're gonna see zero change in the P&L of your call option, okay?

102
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,600
But imagine that stock continues to go up and now it's at 1,000. Well,

103
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,490
all of a sudden from 1,000 to 1,100, you're gonna be making a ton of money.

104
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,580
And that's that gamma exposure, right?

105
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,220
It's your Delta's changing through time or through spot.

106
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,330
Sean, can I share my screen? I wanted to show them something. Yeah, sure.

107
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,250
Should we get? Yep.

108
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,880
So we come over to the terminal here.

109
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,160
So one thing to keep in mind guys is that when we are a gamma,

110
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,840
an option is basically priced if you were to gamma scalp it.

111
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,300
If you were to get, so let's say option is priced at 30 implied vol. Well,

112
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,140
what the market is saying here is if you gamma scalp this,

113
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,560
you would break even, okay? So we're going to show you what I'm talking about.

114
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,640
So let's say the stock's trading at a hundred.

115
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,440
We've got a stock trading at a hundred dollars. Actually,

116
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,160
let's use a real world example.

117
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,150
Steve, something you're looking at. What's the ticker?

118
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,940
DLR. DLR.

119
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,650
So Steve's looking at DLR and he is, in this case, let's say he's long vol.

120
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,790
Okay, he wants to be long volatility.

121
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,200
And Steve, you give me an option with $5 strike. Say, come on, Steve.

122
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,000
I just have to, it's only a dollar wide strike, Steve.

123
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,690
What do we got? ATVI. Okay, thank you, thank you.

124
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,020
Okay, so let's say we're trading ATVI. Okay,

125
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,240
and we're trading these weeklies here.

126
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,650
We're trading these weeklies here. Well,

127
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,160
these options are priced at 27% implied volatility. Okay,

128
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,800
they're priced at 27% implied volatility.

129
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,680
And what that means is if we were to delta hedge this, right,

130
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,280
we would break even because the stock should realize 27% implied volatility.

131
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,900
Okay, so let's say Steve's looking to buy this straddle here.

132
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:01,270
Okay, so if we were to delta hedge this, we would realize 27% implied vol,

133
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,200
which is what the market's saying. Okay,

134
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,320
the market's saying this stock is gonna realize 27%.

135
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,600
Let's head over to the terminal here. Okay, and let's price this out.

136
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,920
So a lot of the time, guys, we're pricing options. Okay,

137
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,700
a lot of time we're pricing them. So that expiration is March 19,

138
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,040
or sorry, March 12.

139
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,880
Okay, and so 27 vol. Stock's trading at 102.25,

140
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,570
and we are buying the 103 strike. Okay, so the straddle price, right,

141
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:54,300
the call price is 229, and the put price is $3. So 5.29 for this straddle.

142
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,960
Okay, $2.29 plus $3, $5.30 to buy this straddle.

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,920
But let's say we think volatility is gonna be 40%.

144
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,400
Okay,

145
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,460
that straddle today should be worth 7.80.

146
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay, it should be worth 7.80 today, but it's trading for 5.30.

147
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,820
Right, so what we need to do is buy this option, buy the straddle,

148
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
and then delta hedge or gamma scalp.

149
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,680
What do you think, Sean?

150
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,860
I think it's good.

151
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,120
So I think quickly, Jordan, if you can try to explain why we have to do that.

152
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,090
Like, okay, so if it's gonna realize 40% vol,

153
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,510
why don't I just buy the straddle? Isn't that what we say?

154
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:05,420
If we think vol is cheap, buy the straddle. Why am I doing this scalp? Dude,

155
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,020
it's a brilliant question. To be honest with you,

156
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,620
I've always asked that question when I was starting out as well.

157
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,880
And so let me- Whiteboard?

158
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,420
Okay, so here's actually the beautiful thing about options, right?

159
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,320
It's something that we don't talk about much in Predicting Alpha,

160
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,480
but it's actually one of the beautiful things about options, okay?

161
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,250
We're looking at a stock here, ATVI, that's being priced at 27, okay?

162
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,990
And it's going to realize 40.

163
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,230
And this is where the stock is starting at, okay? Now,

164
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:03,820
the thing with the stock is it could realize 40 vol multiple ways, okay?

165
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,450
In fact, there is infinite paths, okay? So for example,

166
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,590
this stock could realize 40 vol like this,

167
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,220
okay? It could realize 40 vol like this.

168
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,020
It could realize 40 vol like this,

169
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,590
okay? There are infinite ways at which this could realize 40 vol.

170
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,110
It could also realize 40 vols like this,

171
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,780
okay? And so what delta hedging does, or gamma scalping, the same thing, okay?

172
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:53,160
What this allows us to do is it allows us to convert realized volatility into,

173
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,800
or sorry, implied volatility into realized volatility.

174
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,780
So whether we get this path, we get this path, or we get this path,

175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,540
as long as it realizes 40 vol, we're gonna make money.

176
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,020
Because- As long as it realizes more than 27. Right, right, sorry. Yeah,

177
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,300
as long as it realizes more than 27, we're gonna make money.

178
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,990
It takes away the directional component,

179
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,280
okay? Do you wanna maybe show it day by day maybe,

180
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,820
and how hedging your delta there- Gotcha, gotcha.

181
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,730
Makes the directional component not matter. Okay, so we're gonna go,

182
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,830
we're gonna do one where we don't delta hedge. And also guys, keep in mind,

183
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,950
every path we took there, so when we buy the straddle, okay?

184
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,340
Our expected value is, in our case, 27 minus 40, it was the $3.50.

185
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,800
If we place this trade 1,000 times,

186
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,220
our expected value would be that dollar amount. But on one give and take,

187
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,830
it might not. So let's do that example here. So here's day one, we start here,

188
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,520
okay? We buy this option, 27 vol. Tomorrow, it goes up.

189
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,760
And 40 vol divided by 16, plays plus here. Oh, you know what, Jordan?

190
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,440
I think I actually have a really good way to show this. Can I try to- Yep, yep,

191
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,260
yep, yep. Can I try to show the screen? Okay, let me,

192
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm gonna have to use some big brain power here. Just so you know,

193
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,020
2.5% vol a day, 2.5% move is a 40 vol. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

194
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,960
that won't be necessary for this if my brain works. Nice.

195
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:53,660
So let's say here's where we are today, okay? We buy this option for 27 vol.

196
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,490
We are anticipating it to be about 40% vol, okay?

197
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:11,110
So let's say we get that two, sure, that 2.5% move up, Jordan, okay? So we get,

198
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:17,250
so let's call this our, let's say, you know, this right here, right?

199
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,590
This line where this dot is right now, this is our starting point, right?

200
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,820
So we're on day one right now. We're at our starting point.

201
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:33,250
And then in the first day, it moves up 2.5% to here, right? So this is day one.

202
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,880
And we'll say this is like the end of day one. So we'll call this two. Well,

203
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,940
when we, at this point, if we hedge our deltas, it's like us doing this.

204
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,900
And now we are back at that line again. You see what happened there?

205
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,530
We reset our position. We're back in line with this. Now let's say on day two,

206
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:11,000
it goes down 2.5%, okay? What we do then is we come in and we hedge it again,

207
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,990
and we keep in line with that. We're staying delta neutral here.

208
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:20,840
And we're getting to capture these gains from these moves, right?

209
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,360
And then let's say day three, we get, you know, a 4% move up,

210
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,990
you know, we're gonna come in here and we're gonna,

211
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,140
maybe made that a little too big. And we're gonna bring it back down here.

212
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,720
Come with me, come here, come on. I really like that.

213
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,600
I really like this diagram, dude.

214
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,940
Any questions about this, guys?

215
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,110
And also just to add on to Sean is that if he doesn't delta hedge,

216
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,890
he has delta exposure. So in the first case,

217
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,140
he wants the stock to continue to rally. And if it doesn't, well,

218
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,410
then he's gonna lose. So he's increasing his variance, but he's increasing his,

219
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,890
you know, winners and losers.

220
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,870
But instead what he's doing here is he's removing that exposure,

221
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,640
right? So think about this. Like on this first,

222
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:28,950
when I delta hedged this first one here, I locked in a plus 2.5 move, right?

223
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,830
So I got paid as if the stock moved 2.5 as an absolute move. So, okay,

224
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,430
here's what we're doing.

225
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,630
We are removing positive and negative moves and just having absolute moves.

226
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,590
That's basically what it is, right, Jordan? Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

227
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,490
Right, does that make sense? So imagine this, imagine a stock went plus 2.5,

228
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:56,550
imagine a stock went plus 2.5 on day one, and then it went on day two,

229
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,130
minus 2.5. Oh my God, why am I, something's wrong with me here, dude. 2.5,

230
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:09,410
that would be a total percent move of zero and you wouldn't get paid if you just

231
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:15,990
held the straddle. But if we delta hedged here and we delta hedged here,

232
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,770
what we basically do is we remove this sign and we remove this sign,

233
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,650
leaving us with a total move of 5%.

234
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,230
Yeah, cool, I could do that. Cole's asking,

235
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,620
can we do that like an example with shares? I think for a hypothetical,

236
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,420
it might get a little messy. I think we can do them pretty quick. Okay,

237
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,160
you wanna do it? Yeah.

238
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,540
So here, Teeqo, here, I'll just, you know, show me your screen. Yeah,

239
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,060
you can share your screen.

240
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,540
Of course, Teeqo, we'll always talk about Tesla.

241
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,200
I actually love how every time Teeqo asks a question, we use a Tesla reference.

242
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,260
Yes. Okay, Teeqo, so we buy the straddle, okay? Think about this, okay?

243
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,540
Here we go. So here's day one that Sean talked about, right? Here's day one.

244
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,210
Honestly, gamma scalping Tesla is probably a really good idea. Yeah,

245
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,130
especially on the cheaper, the near-term stuff, it's pretty cheap right now.

246
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:43,770
Okay, so Teeqo, let's say we start here, okay? And Tesla, it's so funny,

247
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,790
I almost called Tesla Teeqo. Might as well, it's interchangeable. And so,

248
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:58,680
Teeqo, Tesla drops 20%. It drops 20%, okay? And now it's trading over here.

249
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:08,260
And we have just made $65,000, okay? We've just made $65,000. Now, okay,

250
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,500
in this case, I'd probably close it,

251
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,380
but imagine we still had a bunch of gamma left, okay? Which,

252
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,980
imagine we still had a bunch of gamma left. Tomorrow,

253
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,700
if we wake up and the stock goes up further, we make a ton of money.

254
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,280
But if it comes back down tomorrow, well, now we're gonna lose money.

255
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:36,560
So what we can do is we can lock in this game. We can actually lock this in.

256
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,380
The way we lock this in is flattening our deltas.

257
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,640
So now we have no directional exposure. So Jordan,

258
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,160
do you wanna maybe put a price slice there and then flatten your deltas and show

259
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,820
how that changes the instantaneous? Yeah,

260
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,040
so one thing to keep in mind is the shares aren't gonna be here at this price,

261
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,520
so it's gonna be a little bit different, but- Oh, actually, no,

262
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,380
you should be able to adjust the bid you're putting in for the share. Okay,

263
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,170
let's see. Shouldn't you? We will find out, sir. Exactly, Cole,

264
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:17,500
you'd buy shares there. Right, so Tesla comes down, it's at 665, and we say,

265
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,340
okay, we need to buy some shares here to remove our directional exposure.

266
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,600
And lock in our game. Exactly, well, okay, so what's that? 665,

267
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,460
we're gonna buy shares. But how many do we buy? Well, we need to buy 650,

268
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,810
right? That's our delta. So let's say we buy 650.

269
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,570
We have a negative 650 delta and each share is a positive delta,

270
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,390
so we want that to be at zero, so we'd buy 650.

271
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,980
And so now you can see here, well, if the stock, because we're long gamma,

272
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,580
so we still want movement. So if the stock falls back down to, let's say, 800,

273
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,580
well, we're gonna make a ton of money, right? We're gonna be up $69,000,

274
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,000
okay? And because we're long gamma, we want movement. If the stock rallies,

275
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,220
if the stock continues to drop, well, we're still gonna make money.

276
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,260
So let me ask you guys this question. How do we lose money?

277
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,600
The stock falls down, we make, yeah. The stock falls down, we make money.

278
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,180
The stock rallies, we make money. How do we lose money?

279
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,180
Marcos is saying no volatility. Tell me more, Marcos. Tell me more.

280
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,820
Do you need to know more?

281
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,560
Expires worthless,

282
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,260
beta. Marcos, I need, who said that? Who said that one? Marcos? Perfect.

283
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,860
Sylvan, quickly, second place also said beta. Exactly, right?

284
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,820
There's no free money here. Okay, there's no free money here. Every single day,

285
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,100
we can see right here, our position is gonna lose $1,000.

286
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,880
Okay, so- That's too many words. For that gamma,

287
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,840
right? We are paying for that gamma to have that exposure of, okay,

288
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,400
if the stock moves up and the stock moves down, we're gonna make money, right?

289
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,600
And so it needs to move up and down by a certain amount.

290
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,470
And it has to move actually by the amount of our theta,

291
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,290
how much we're gonna lose. Yeah,

292
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,190
it basically has to move more than the implied move,

293
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,790
right? Remember, we bought at 27, expecting it to move more than 27.

294
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,190
If it moves less than 27 implied vol, we lose.

295
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,360
And what's that number? Well, our daily break-even is 27 divided by 16.

296
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,620
That is 1.8%. So as long as the stock moves by more than 1.8% tomorrow,

297
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,280
we're gonna make money. Okay, if we lock that in.

298
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,740
By the way, guys, read what Red's saying.

299
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,760
He's sharing some good points in the chat. But Jordan, I guess,

300
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,990
I think people are starting to understand it.

301
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:16,080
We'll take some questions at the end, but how do we turn this into a strategy?

302
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,120
Because one thing that people need,

303
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,500
traders would need to keep in mind is I need to be able to buy and sell shares.

304
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,180
So when you were, okay, let's assume for a minute,

305
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,400
you have a thousand dollar account, just a nice round number.

306
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,770
How much should you allocate for a straddle?

307
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,270
And how much should you allocate for shares?

308
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,370
Like what ratio of your account should you have available for hedging to efficiently

309
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,290
run a gamma scalping strategy? Dude, super great question.

310
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:57,810
So usually you should have 50% of your max deltas in capital, okay?

311
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,010
You wanna- In non vol terms. Okay, so in this case, right?

312
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,480
So we're gonna do one more, okay?

313
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,440
What is the max amount of shares that we would ever buy in a one lot?

314
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,640
What would be the maximum shares we would ever need?

315
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,960
100, Koaw got it first. Justin, you said that really skeptical. You said 100?

316
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,470
You don't get the points, man. Perfect, so if we, if our delta,

317
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,650
if we're all the way over here, guys, we'll check that out, right?

318
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,770
Our delta is 100, it's negative 99.

319
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:44,620
I usually leave 50% I would need in gunpowder, okay? So 50%,

320
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,180
so 50 deltas on Tesla, right? So because you guys can see here, right?

321
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,800
Like when we get to 50, right? We're usually closing out the position.

322
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,780
We're starting to run out of gamma. So I need 50 deltas.

323
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:08,580
So 50 times $600 is 30 grand, okay? And 30 grand, cause I'm using margin.

324
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,640
I don't know how, I think it's a 50% in the States.

325
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:19,790
I would need 15,000 in gunpowder. So I buy this straddle for 66. Oh, sorry,

326
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:26,300
I buy this straddle for 10 grand and then I need 15 grand behind. So Jordan,

327
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,460
another question for you here. We sort of, as a rule of thumb,

328
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,020
say trade stocks that are liquid and above $15 in price.

329
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,720
So that might put some people, you know,

330
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,980
hypothetically someone's got like a $600 account. They're just trying to learn.

331
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,320
That might put them in a bit of a tricky spot. So for a strategy like this,

332
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,880
does that rule that we've sort of said to sort of stick with change?

333
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,740
It doesn't.

334
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,420
And I actually want to ask the guys this question to see who's on their toes today.

335
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,520
What would be the characteristics of a stock that would offer the most leverage?

336
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,460
So obviously you have a small account. You're gonna need leverage, right?

337
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,220
There's no ways around that.

338
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,130
So what characteristics of a stock would offer the most leverage? Who's got it?

339
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:29,700
Steve's got it. I know he's got it. It's for sure. Danny's saying a 3X ETF. 3X,

340
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,690
okay. Come on, Danny. You're better than this. Absolutely not. Steve,

341
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,540
what's the answer here, bud? Wow. Wow, Trent. Oh, my man. Trent,

342
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,040
if you can expand on that, that'd be great. That is the right answer.

343
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,170
That is the right answer.

344
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,110
Because they are less risky? Okay, it's not that they're less risky.

345
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,980
It's that you can buy them, right? The gamma is gonna be extremely low.

346
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,220
So you can buy these things for extremely cheap, right?

347
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,600
And because it's basically, it's something, the market should just say like,

348
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,140
if it's something really low vol, right? Well, if nothing happens,

349
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,680
you're not gonna lose a lot. But if something does happen,

350
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,800
you're gonna make a boatload, right? So the low vol,

351
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,020
you're gonna have very low gamma. Oh, so my apologies.

352
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,000
You're gonna have the highest gamma, the lowest theta, right?

353
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,040
The rent ratio is gonna be the lowest. The lower the vol,

354
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,680
the lower the rent ratio. So let's, for example,

355
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,050
and just to show you guys here super quick, let's take a look at Tesla, okay?

356
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:45,360
We'll go to Tesla, we'll go to Tesla March, okay? And we'll buy a Straddle.

357
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,160
Actually, we won't go March, my apologies. We'll go March 19th.

358
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,470
We'll take a look here, okay? And the rent ratio, so our theta, 1100,

359
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:05,230
and our gamma's five, okay? Now let's go over to Coke,

360
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:23,300
okay? So 1100 to five, and here it's 252 gamma to 40 thetas, right?

361
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,480
The leverage is extreme, right? Imagine, for example, a 10% move in Coke.

362
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,980
That'd be huge. Your payout would be massive. In Tesla, it'd be a normal day,

363
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,450
okay? So your leverage is huge here.

364
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,100
And so to answer the question there, Sean,

365
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,900
what you need to do is you need to go and find these low vol,

366
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:58,300
potentially huge moves, right? Potential big moves, low vol.

367
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,780
So Red's saying, we want a gamma scalp,

368
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,440
but it looks like the implied move is smaller than the average move.

369
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,100
Tasty Trade would say, you know, I'm not saying this is Red's opinion,

370
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,340
he's just sharing, Tasty Trade would say,

371
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,620
only consider doing this if IV rank is under 30.

372
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:23,610
So there's this big misconception, and Sean and I did a live on this,

373
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,790
or a video on this, that buying low IV rank, or sorry,

374
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,460
selling low- Selling high IV rank. Selling high IV rank works, right?

375
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,360
And this is actually the opposite of what we see. Usually when IV vol is high,

376
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,020
realized vol is even higher, right?

377
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,380
Think about selling implied volatility during a market crash.

378
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,840
Think about- Or on GameStop. Or on GameStop, right? If the stock moves 50%,

379
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,840
you're done. You're toast, right?

380
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,180
So what we usually see is implied vol doesn't get as high as realized vol when it's

381
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:07,110
high. And when it's low, it's usually at a premium. So here's a quick example.

382
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,190
A lot of hedge funds, what they'll do is they'll sell the VIX,

383
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,470
and this is very popular in like the vol arm space in hedge funds.

384
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,950
They'll sell VIX futures when VIX is in contango, right?

385
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,190
Meaning that VIX is downward sloping. The future curve is downward sloping.

386
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,240
And they'll buy vol when it's upward sloping. Okay,

387
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,500
so kind of opposite to maybe what tasty trade might say.

388
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:41,050
In this case, right? You wanna buy vol when it's cheap,

389
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,890
relative to what you think it's going to be. Yeah, and so what we'll,

390
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,130
obviously this involves forecasting future vol a bit.

391
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,770
This is where the terminal becomes your best friend, right?

392
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,890
So we're gonna get into that in a minute.

393
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,750
But before we move into the terminal and some filtering you can use to find stocks

394
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,390
that you may want to do this on, right? Because I think,

395
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,330
like I've been thinking about it. I think for,

396
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,450
if you're relatively new to options and have a, you know,

397
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,610
on the smaller side account, I think this is an,

398
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,330
and especially if you're from the US,

399
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,660
this is something definitely worth looking at.

400
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,290
So Jordan. Yeah. Straddle or strangle?

401
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:34,160
Yeah, so strangle more advanced. Let's see if Trent can get this one. Trent,

402
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,240
max loss on a Delta head strangle. What is it? What do we got dude?

403
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,870
And Steve. He needs a minute. He's analyzing the trade right now. Okay, sorry.

404
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:54,460
No, hold on guys, guys. Max loss on a Delta head straddle. Who's got that one?

405
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,360
Okay, but then we'll go into the strangle.

406
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:05,080
Max loss. So let me, let me open these up. What are the guys saying there,

407
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:12,180
Trent? Co is saying the spread, the width. Okay, so the width, okay.

408
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,420
Or one full leg.

409
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,080
Okay, so my apologies guys. What is the max loss on a Delta head straddle?

410
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,560
Let's start simple. Max loss on a Delta head straddle.

411
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,640
Theta, the lowest point in the graph. Thank you. The debit, the debit you pay.

412
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:45,490
That is the max loss. Now let's take a look at a strangle.

413
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,140
Is the max loss on a strangle the debit you pay? Who's got the answer there?

414
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,440
Is the max loss on a strangle the debit you paid? Assuming Delta hedging.

415
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,240
Width of the strikes. Width of the strikes.

416
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,310
Steve's saying it's more than the debit. Why, why Steve? Why Steve?

417
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,390
Why would it be more?

418
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:23,360
He's like, that's what I got, man. I was hoping you would roll with it. Yes,

419
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,640
that's actually what he's like. That's what I got. Okay,

420
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,880
so the max you can lose on a straddle is the debit you paid. Okay.

421
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,940
Now imagine this guys.

422
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:43,210
Imagine this. Imagine you buy the strangle. Okay. And it moves to 729.

423
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,680
Moves to seven. Actually, let's go a little wider here.

424
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:01,650
Let's say it moves to 700 on the strangle. Well, now you're short,

425
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,600
you're short 200 Deltas. Okay, so you buy 200 shares.

426
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,610
Now imagine if the stock moves down. Okay, so you buy 200 shares.

427
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,440
So let's go buy 200 shares.

428
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,490
So you buy 200 shares at 681.

429
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:46,560
Well, now check this out. What if the stock goes to 600 and then gets pinned?

430
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,930
Right, then it gets pinned. And so now you're decaying with theta, right?

431
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,950
You're stuck over here. You're decaying with theta.

432
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,530
And you just lost a ton of money, like a ton of money, right?

433
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,910
And I actually know a guy who's on the floor of the Siebel trading crude.

434
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,950
And he was in a huge position on a Delta 10 strangle.

435
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,750
And stock moved and he got pinned. Or it's not the stock, sorry,

436
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:25,530
the commodity moved and he got pinned to the strike, right?

437
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,450
And this is the worst case scenario for you.

438
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,190
So trading strangles are a bit trickier, okay? For a couple of reasons.

439
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:41,990
One is you can get pinned, in which case you can lose a lot of money, okay?

440
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,260
Second case is there's other Greeks involved, right?

441
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,480
There's third order Greeks that are happening that might kind of throw you off balance.

442
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,200
So I started with straddles, really wide, really tight strangles, okay?

443
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,110
Stock's trading at 97.50, maybe do the 195 strangle. When you get wide,

444
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,460
you know, sure you get a ton of leverage, but you gotta be very careful. Okay,

445
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,620
it's more of an advanced, you know, like no need to rush it here. Yeah.

446
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:25,010
You know what I mean? So for the purposes of this live, straddle. Straddle.

447
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,210
Right, this is for learning purposes, straddle, all right? Straddle.

448
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,570
Stick with the straddle for now. As you get better,

449
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,790
if you choose to pursue this further, we'll talk about strangles.

450
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,660
Small account challenge for gamma scalping, straddle. Jordan,

451
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,560
how many days to expiration? You know, given,

452
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,140
we want the learning experience here.

453
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,660
We want this to be a profitable learning experience.

454
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:57,040
How many days to expiration to minimize the choices someone has to make,

455
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,100
and they can focus on the good stuff. How do they pick it,

456
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,930
or what would you recommend? I'd recommend two.

457
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,750
I recommend trying longer data stuff, 90 days, 120 days.

458
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,700
Try playing with that Vega, right? Cheap way to play with the Vega.

459
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,380
And then, you know, 20 days. 20 days to expiration, 15 days to expiration,

460
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,290
play with the gamma. And as you're doing that,

461
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,110
you should be asking questions about it in the group,

462
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,230
and people can help you out. Like,

463
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,350
clearly there's a few guys in here who know their stuff when it comes to gamma scalping.

464
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,650
Jordan, next question for you. How often should you be hedging it?

465
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,570
Do you set a threshold for hedging? Do you, you know,

466
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:42,380
if you're in the States and you have, you know, unlimited trades, more or less,

467
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,330
you know, say you're trading something super liquid, do you sit there all day,

468
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,700
scalp, scalp, you know, scalping your pips? What do you do? Hedges to close.

469
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,360
Hedges to close. And Sean, I'm going to say this, man.

470
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,000
I'll promise everyone on this live here.

471
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,300
If they buy a 20 day straddle and they Delta hedge every single day,

472
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,300
they will be a completely different person when that straddle expires. Wow.

473
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,750
That's a, it's a big claim. Yeah, it's a big claim. It's a bit,

474
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,870
it's a good claim though. So you're saying hedge at the close.

475
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,230
Why are you saying that?

476
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,380
So there's obviously, you know, better ways to hedge,

477
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,440
but that kind of like incorporates a second strategy or you got a Delta one strategy

478
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,660
and a vol strategy. You know, just pick a, you know, just hedge at the close,

479
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,460
right? Or pick a threshold. So there's two ways you can do this.

480
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,660
Pick a threshold, which is, okay, after a hundred Deltas, hedge.

481
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,780
Or at the close, hedge.

482
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,540
All we're doing here is we are removing our directional exposure.

483
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,060
There's no reason to get too excited about it. Maybe set it as like,

484
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,170
if your Delta represents 1% of your account hedge or hedge at the close.

485
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,480
Obviously stick to one. So don't, don't, don't, don't like be like, oh,

486
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,160
you know, I'm doing this one today and this one tomorrow.

487
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,900
Stick to one and just do it for, you know,

488
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,600
you guys aren't going to lose a lot of money. I think- Yeah. Yeah. Maybe,

489
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,400
maybe, maybe do that. Hedge at 1% of your, of your account.

490
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,540
Up to you. It's arbitrary. Yeah, it's arbitrary. For now, just,

491
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,620
I guarantee you guys, just give it a try.

492
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,880
You're not going to lose a lot of money. Buy what's cheap vol to you.

493
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,900
Delta hedge it. You're not going to lose a lot of money. Worst case scenario.

494
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,680
Best case scenario, the stock blows out. And please just, you know,

495
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,700
remember this live and it's your yacht party.

496
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,170
I'll share my Venmo with you and you can send me some money. Yeah.

497
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:53,570
Just subscribe to my only fans. If you, if you hit the jackpot.

498
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,120
All right. Danny's saying, I'm going to give it a try for fun. All right, man.

499
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,280
Let's see it happen. You better,

500
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,950
you better be giving us the daily updates in the chat. Daily update, man. Okay.

501
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,430
Got a couple more questions here for you. And Danny,

502
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,710
if you're going to be giving it a try make sure you ask your questions.

503
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,410
And post the results. Post daily results. Like day one, Delta this. Track it.

504
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,690
Yeah, track it.

505
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,030
When do you close the position?

506
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,840
So I would close it. So it really depends on your gamma, right?

507
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,970
If the stock's all the way up here we don't have any gamma left. I'm out.

508
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,030
Right. So that's going to be,

509
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:39,360
you know before we put on any position guys really think about, well,

510
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,520
what are the possibilities? Right?

511
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,540
Like this is something that Sean and I are trying to get you guys to do in silver

512
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,060
which is the tree diagram.

513
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,530
Before we even put on this position we should look at this graph right here and

514
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,160
say what could happen tomorrow? Right? So for example,

515
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,500
we stress it to tomorrow, one day and well,

516
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,720
what do I do if the stock goes here? Right?

517
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,780
What do I do if the stock goes here?

518
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,020
What do I do if the stock goes here or here? Right? And usually we say,

519
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,560
okay by a certain gamma amount, I'm out. Right? If the stock is,

520
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,080
let's say up here I'm out of the position.

521
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,770
And you can also look at that theta amount as well. Right?

522
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:25,620
You can see our theta drops from 1800 at the money to 900. Right?

523
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:32,770
It's the position is done. So, you know,

524
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,670
we want to get back into that new position now where, okay, ball's cheap.

525
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,430
Let's get back into the, at the monies. Right?

526
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,030
And that's one thing about the strangles,

527
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,900
you know going a little off the road here take a look at the strangles. Right?

528
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,400
Look at this, look at this guys. Check out that theta. Okay.

529
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,420
Check out that theta there. You guys see that theta number?

530
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,300
What do you guys notice about that theta number? Who's got it? Who's got it?

531
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,160
What do you guys notice about that theta number on the strangle versus that straddle?

532
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,270
Higher. Increasing. Perfect. Like it, so it actually, it's a,

533
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,450
it's a lot more constant.

534
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,240
So if the stock moves here or the stock moves there you're going to have that constant

535
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,200
gamma. Right? But as a straddle, as the stock moves, you deplete your gamma.

536
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,290
And what the gamma means is basically your sensitivity to the movement. Right?

537
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:32,930
So check this out guys. You know, super exciting, super good life.

538
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,170
I'm pumped up. You guys are pumped up. This is good stuff. Right?

539
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,180
So take a look at this, right? Let's say the stock moves up here. Okay.

540
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,680
Let's say the stock moves to 950. Right? Or watch this.

541
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,240
Watch this.

542
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,670
Okay. Oops.

543
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,540
We're going to sell. So we're over here at 950. Okay. We need to sell.

544
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,880
How many do we need to sell?

545
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,150
400 at 950.

546
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,820
So let's take a look at this. Look at that exposure guys. Right?

547
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,120
Look at that exposure. It's like a straddle. Right?

548
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,280
We still have a ton of gamma.

549
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,060
So that is the beauty of the strangle as well. Right? Is we get this constant.

550
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,060
We get this gamma across a huge time, a huge width. Okay.

551
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,420
But it's also can be more risky. But there's no free lunch in this game.

552
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,790
You want more, you want more risk or you want more reward?

553
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,780
You got to take on more risk. Okay.

554
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,330
So Jordan,

555
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,330
we're going to hop into the terminal in a second and actually talk about, okay,

556
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,130
well, how do we find the right trade to be doing this on? Right.

557
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,610
But before we do that, Red had a question. He said, Sean,

558
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,190
you were saying that gamma scalping resets your position,

559
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,790
but Jordan was saying that gamma gets depleted. Can we resolve,

560
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,890
can you resolve this, you know, things button heads. All right, Sean.

561
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,380
All right. Square up. Red, you're the best. Okay.

562
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,040
So, so gamma scalping, I think what Sean meant there is delta. Okay.

563
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,640
So when you flatten your delta, okay, your gamma can get,

564
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,860
your gamma can get depleted, right? You have no gamma here. Okay.

565
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,520
You can see that by the blue line, the purple line, that convexity, right?

566
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,120
You see that convexity here, right? Let me just super quick.

567
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,400
So Red, check this out. Okay. If I were to draw a line here, Red, a flat line,

568
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,600
a tangent line back to, I see you're kidding me, man. Dude,

569
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,520
just use the straight line tool. I don't know why you try and do this. Okay.

570
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:03,470
Here we go. Here we go. Okay. Okay, okay. Red, let's go back to,

571
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,830
to first year calc. Okay.

572
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,480
Is this calc? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is, maybe, maybe second.

573
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,540
Maybe advanced functions. Yeah. Is it the tangent line? It could, it could be.

574
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,980
I don't know. Oh my God. Derivative, I guess. Okay. Okay. Here we go.

575
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,810
Here we go.

576
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,200
Okay, Red. So you see that convexity there, right?

577
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,260
You see how it's not straight. It's not linear. It has like that convexity.

578
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,450
And as long as we have that convexity, we're long gamma. Okay.

579
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,770
Now let's go over here, right?

580
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:49,030
If I draw a tangent line somewhere at some point, there's no convexity.

581
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:58,150
So what happens is as long as we have that gamma, delta hedging,

582
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,920
all it does is take that directional exposure away. That's all it does.

583
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,560
So now we get back to whatever point we are.

584
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,820
Remember when Sean was showing that like a tree diagram?

585
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,250
If, so take a look at this. Okay. Take a look at this. Sorry, Sean.

586
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,250
This is the one. This is the one that's going to set away. Okay.

587
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,370
So you can see here, right? I draw this diagonal line here.

588
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:31,400
And right over here is where we are going to be delta neutral. Okay.

589
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,480
In this position here, let's say. Yeah. So when I did that reset,

590
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,660
it's like putting you as that tangent line now. Exactly. Exactly.

591
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,940
So if you look like Jordan, show them like where they are right at the bottom,

592
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,220
draw a tangent line at the delta neutral spot. Well, Inception.

593
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,660
So I know I'm actually going to go delta neutral here.

594
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,900
I'm going to flatten the deltas right here. Do it. So right here,

595
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:57,360
you can see that we are 500 deltas. Okay.

596
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,960
We need to be long 500 deltas to flatten.

597
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,980
Check that out now, Red. Right. You see that now?

598
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:09,390
Now we don't care what happens, right? As long as it moves,

599
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,320
right? We basically took this line and we did this.

600
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,060
We took that line, Red, and we did this.

601
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:32,000
That's it. We tilted it. As long as we're that gamma, we have that convexity.

602
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,900
So Jordan, one last thing before we hop into the terminal.

603
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,960
I said that this is a great way if you have a small account to, you know,

604
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,670
grow it. Is this limited to small accounts? No,

605
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,830
this is limited to market makers. You know,

606
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:55,240
market makers are doing this on a daily basis. Right. So what would you say,

607
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,200
like, if you were to, if someone were to say, like,

608
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,680
why should I do gamma scalping? What would you really tell them? Okay.

609
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,350
So I just want you guys to know, like, I do this all the time. Okay.

610
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,420
If I'm long volatility, if I'm long volatility,

611
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,440
and usually I'm not long volatility on a 10-day option,

612
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,640
I'm usually long volatility on a 30-day, 40-day option.

613
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:21,190
If the stock moves up 7% in a day, and I still have gamma,

614
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:32,510
Jordan, I can take the risk if I want to, if I want to increase the variance,

615
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,910
nothing wrong with that, or I could just remove that risk.

616
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,310
Okay.

617
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:44,610
So it's all you're doing is you're removing the risk of the directional bet.

618
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,340
If you think the stock is going to rally still, well, don't remove it.

619
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:50,250
You know,

620
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,490
if the stock goes up and you still think it's going to go up and you're long gamma,

621
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,370
why would you hedge your deltas?

622
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,290
Hedging your delta and gamma scalping is taking away that risk.

623
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:07,050
It allows you to convert implied to realized volatility and learn about how to trade

624
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,790
volatility. And, you know, and not just learn about it, actually trade it.

625
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,550
Do the thing. Do the thing, do the thing, right? Like, I'm always hedging.

626
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,350
I'm always hedging my deltas, right? I'm usually concerned about my thetas,

627
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,050
right? So I'll take out my deltas, I'll take out my thetas,

628
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,910
and now I'm just left with, let's say, you know, in that case,

629
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,170
I'm talking about relative value. Yeah, my view on,

630
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:31,350
I'm assuming relative value,

631
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,710
my view on one option's gamma versus the other option's gamma. So Jordan,

632
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,010
I think at this point, because it's nine o'clock, guys,

633
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,630
I want to thank you for sticking around so long. You know, I hope the content,

634
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,690
it's not because you fell asleep. Because you're pumped.

635
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,450
Because you're pumped up, right? That's why you're still here at nine o'clock.

636
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,210
So Jordan,

637
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,670
now let's get into the moment that a lot of people have been waiting for.

638
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,310
They've been sitting here saying, goddammit,

639
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,990
when are they gonna show me how to find a trade for this?

640
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:02,550
Let's hop into the terminal, Jordan. Yeah. And show how to filter for this.

641
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,620
Until next time. We'll see you guys. And that will be in part two. Okay, okay,

642
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,940
okay, okay, okay. So let's go volatility trader, right? We're in volatility,

643
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,900
and we're gonna go to the volatility analyzer. And we're looking for cheap vol,

644
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,000
okay? So one thing is,

645
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,800
is we need to know that our IV versus our forecast is cheap, right?

646
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,420
So implied vol divided by the forecast is 0.1. What do you wanna look for?

647
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,370
Something under 0.9? Yeah, so maybe, yeah, you know what? Honestly,

648
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,290
I'd go 0.99,

649
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:42,670
because sometimes you can find these like fundamentally cheap ones. Okay.

650
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,970
So for example, there's actually so many examples,

651
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,670
but I'll just give you one super quick that I did a long time ago.

652
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,910
Foot Locker back in 2017. This is when I was learning about gamma scalping.

653
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:01,530
They had a court case coming up. And for some reason,

654
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,250
market wasn't pricing it in. It was a pretty big court case.

655
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,450
And so I bought vol, you know, the stock shot through the roof,

656
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,190
and it was a good trade.

657
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,980
And then the court case got thrown out the next day and nothing happened. Yeah.

658
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,060
Okay, so IV versus forecast, we want that below one, right?

659
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,600
We want the implied volatility higher than what we think is gonna happen. Well,

660
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,420
throw on your price and option volume filters first. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,160
We always gotta, you know, we gotta, you know, best practices here.

662
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,320
We gotta make sure there's some volume and we gotta make sure that it's not a penny

663
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,540
stock. Exactly, exactly. You know, I'm usually gonna like to trade over,

664
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:42,830
we like to trade over 20 bucks here. And now implied volatility, okay,

665
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,250
we're resigning here. Implied volatility, I'm gonna want below, okay,

666
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,490
I'm gonna want below 50 here.

667
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,680
Okay, I'm gonna want cheap vol.

668
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,350
And then I also want IV rank. I'm gonna have IV rank below.

669
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,280
So it's gonna be above a certain threshold, right?

670
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,680
Because if the stock's not realizing anything, implied vol is gonna be too low,

671
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:11,190
right? And it's basically gonna be RVs down here, IVs up here. Okay,

672
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:16,520
and we want, I'm gonna say IV below 50. Okay, and now look, we have 20 stocks.

673
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,130
We just filtered for 20 stocks. All right, so let's say for example,

674
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:25,670
and you know what? We're gonna filter by IV versus forecast.

675
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:35,680
AKAM, okay? AKAM. It's the first one, right? So IV versus forecast, 0.77,

676
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,320
right? Very cheap. Actually,

677
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,420
is there any stock that you guys see right off the bat that you guys wanna talk

678
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:48,680
about? Go through them. Okay, so we got WFC here, okay? We got STZ on the list.

679
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,380
Isn't that Constellation? Yeah, yeah, the Constellation brand.

680
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,820
We got Constellation brand on the list.

681
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:05,350
TSN, XRT, XRT, TAP. What do you guys see? What do you guys like? Marcos,

682
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,190
I know you like this stuff, Marcos. Is Marcos still around? Yeah,

683
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:13,900
Marcos is still here. Nice, nice. KHC, I remember trading earnings on the KHC.

684
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,660
Okay, we got two for MTCH. I think those on page two. Okay,

685
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,820
okay, MTCH, okay. So average option volume, 13K, pretty liquid.

686
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:28,870
We're looking good. Yeah, implied vol versus forecast, 89.

687
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:33,570
We can see that the implied volatility 30 day is 45%. I have it ranked 37.

688
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,810
Looks, this actually looks great. Looks great. Who came up with this one?

689
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:44,190
This one looks really good. Koa and Danny. Okay, nice. So you come here, MTCH,

690
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,410
and, right, we're gonna buy a straddle. Or, you know what?

691
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,490
Because I know you guys love a little bit of leverage, we'll do a strangle,

692
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,010
okay? No, no, do the straddle. Just do the straddle just for,

693
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,750
we need this to be like the step,

694
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,290
and people are gonna watch this again to get the steps. So let's do straddle.

695
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:08,550
The one issue is we don't have the 160, 250 strike. So we're gonna do the 165,

696
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,550
160, super tight strangle. Couldn't you start with a little delta hedge?

697
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,340
I guess, yeah. Actually, really good point, Sean. Really good point. Okay,

698
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,860
so we're gonna buy the 165 straddle. Now take in, guys.

699
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:27,910
The delta here is 47 and 53. So right off the bat,

700
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,410
we're gonna be short negative six deltas.

701
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:40,040
Okay, and negative six times 100, and our negative 0.6 times 100 is 60 deltas.

702
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:48,010
So here we are. We are short 60 deltas. And so that's not a lot of deltas,

703
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,630
right? So basically what this is saying is you're short 70 shares.

704
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:55,690
You're short 70 shares. Can you handle that variance? I'm sure you can, right?

705
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,890
Everyone in this chat can handle 70 shares of variance.

706
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,780
So we come in here and the stock moves up, let's say 3% tomorrow.

707
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,550
We're gonna be long 257 deltas.

708
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,680
So we're gonna have to come in and sell some shares.

709
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,520
We're gonna have to sell some shares.

710
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,160
Make sure you're trading something that leaves you that 50% threshold for hedging.

711
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,700
Yeah. Make sure you have that.

712
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,760
Yep, there you go, right? Now we hedge 250 shares. The stock goes down,

713
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,420
we make money. Stock goes up, we make money.

714
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:44,540
If the stock passes with time and doesn't move, we lose money. So I guess,

715
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,720
Jordan, a couple of questions just to end off the slide.

716
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,960
Bringing it back to when we close this out.

717
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,280
So obviously you're gonna hedge your deltas.

718
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,420
You're gonna pick a threshold here.

719
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:57,560
You're either gonna do it maybe every time your delta number is 1% of your account

720
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,660
value. Maybe you're gonna do it at the end of the day.

721
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:04,280
You're gonna pick a threshold, stick to it and hedge. Now,

722
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,900
questions you gotta ask. When are you right and you take it off?

723
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,460
When are you wrong and you take it off, right? At the end of the day,

724
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,660
if this is a big loser, maybe you wanna get out of it. If it's a big winner,

725
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,680
maybe you wanna get out of it.

726
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,840
What are these metrics that we should look for to exit? Yeah, so super quick,

727
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,240
I would say, put these trades on.

728
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,440
You guys are gonna figure that out for yourselves, in my opinion.

729
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,680
That being said, the losers are gonna be extremely, extremely, extremely small,

730
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,340
okay? If you trade this small size in terms of debit. So let's say,

731
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,140
for example, this is $1,670 to buy one of these, okay?

732
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,130
If that's too much for you, don't trade this, okay?

733
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:47,020
So pick a debit that you're comfortable with. Now,

734
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,600
you're not even gonna- And you can actually choose that with like the stock price,

735
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,940
pretty much. Yeah, and the thing is,

736
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,220
you are not gonna lose this full debit because you're gonna be delta hedging,

737
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:04,040
okay? So you're gonna make back some money. So pick, let's say, a debit,

738
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:11,260
times it by 50%. So in this case, 1,670 times 50% is 800 bucks.

739
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:16,190
If you're okay with losing $800, this is perfect. Okay,

740
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:20,980
so you're not gonna lose a lot of money, first off. So closing this out,

741
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,740
I wouldn't even say worry about it. Just keep delta hedging, keep learning.

742
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,080
Keep learning about this as you do it. You're not gonna lose a ton of money.

743
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,150
In terms of taking it out, you guys will know this as well, okay?

744
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:35,110
You're gonna wake up one morning and the stocks rally 10%, okay?

745
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:39,040
You just close the damn position. Red's got a question here. He's saying,

746
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:45,060
should I have a profit target on the entire straddle strangle or individual targets

747
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:49,650
on either side? Yeah, when you enter this trade, Red,

748
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:55,800
you are buying the straddle because why? Why are we buying the straddle?

749
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,780
Really important question. Why are we buying the straddle?

750
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,340
He says he wants like a sharp move. Okay, it's more than that,

751
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,500
it's more than that. Okay, we're buying the straddle. Or he's saying gamma.

752
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,620
Well, we're buying the straddle because we think it's worth more. Yeah.

753
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,500
Because if we delta hedge, it's worth more.

754
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,510
So we have an expectation of what this is worth, right?

755
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,610
Before we even buy the straddle, we value it.

756
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,780
This straddle is worth $20 to us and I can buy it for 1670 right now.

757
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:36,980
So when I realize that 300 bucks, I'm out. Exactly, Sylvain.

758
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,300
Sylvain's saying the vol's cheap. Exactly, the vol's cheap.

759
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,240
And so when finally, right, when we realize what we expect to realize, I'm out.

760
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,920
Or if I buy this position right now and tomorrow I realize 400 bucks on a 16,

761
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,160
on 24, I buy it for 1600. I think it's worth 20. I think it's worth $400 more.

762
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,830
And tomorrow the stock moves 400 bucks. Most likely I'm out. But you know,

763
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:07,830
that's for another talk of when we reevaluate. But most likely, we're out.

764
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,850
But we got the move we wanted to onto the next one.

765
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,800
Exactly, Red. Yeah.

766
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:23,070
All right, guys, that is going to conclude this live. That is Gamma Scalping.

767
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,790
I highly recommend anybody looking to learn vol seriously for you to the space.

768
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,390
If you're trying to grow a small account, this is what to do, right?

769
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,310
Spend a lot of time thinking about it. I think this is,

770
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:40,940
I hope you're as excited as I am to see this brought to the Predicting Alpha members.

771
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,120
I'm amped. Jordan, we should totally have, for the strategy scanner,

772
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,640
we should have like a Gamma Scalp thing.

773
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:56,680
We should. Pip Scalper. Pip Scalper. We're going to have a cheap vol one.

774
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,240
Can we call it the Pip Scalper? We can call it the Pip Scalper. Okay, good,

775
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:02,640
good, good.

776
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,260
All right, everyone, we're going to end the live there. I hope you enjoyed it.

777
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,180
And we'll see you all tomorrow. See you guys.
